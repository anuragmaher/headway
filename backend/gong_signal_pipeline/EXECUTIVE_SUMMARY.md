# Executive Summary — Customer Call Intelligence

**Date:** Based on latest pipeline run  
**Source:** 102 customer calls (sales demos, support, success)  
**Method:** AI extraction of product-level needs and pains → problem-theme classification → incremental updates → quantification

---

## In brief

We analyzed **102 customer calls** and turned them into **200 product signals** (needs, gaps, friction) grouped into **6 problem themes**. Themes describe customer problem areas, not features, and are suitable for discovery, prioritization, and roadmap discussions. (Includes incremental batches classified into the same taxonomy.)

## Key numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Customer calls analyzed | 102 |
| Product-relevant signals mapped | 200 |
| Themes (problem areas) | 6 |
| Calls with at least one signal | 73 |

## Top 6 themes (by frequency)

What customers talked about most:

| # | Theme | Mentions |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Lack of Automation and Integration** | 64 |
| 2 | **User Experience and Setup Challenges** | 44 |
| 3 | **Visibility and Tracking Issues** | 34 |
| 4 | **Email Management Inefficiencies** | 23 |
| 5 | **Cost and Value Concerns** | 19 |
| 6 | **Support and Communication Gaps** | 16 |

## Strategic takeaways

**1. Automation and integration lead**  
Lack of automation and integration is the top theme (64 mentions). Customers want better connectivity, workflow automation, and less manual work. Strong candidate for positioning and roadmap.

**2. UX and visibility**  
User experience/setup (44) and visibility/tracking (34) show operational friction and demand for clarity. Messaging on ease of setup and visibility aligns with what we hear.

**3. Email, cost, and support**  
Email management (23), cost/value (19), and support/communication gaps (16) round out the set. Good input for roadmap and value messaging.

## Recommended next steps

1. **Validate with CS/Sales** — Review these 6 themes with customer-facing teams.
2. **Roadmap alignment** — Use themes (with other inputs) for prioritization and sequencing.
3. **Messaging** — Emphasize automation, integration, visibility, and ease of setup in positioning.
4. **Scale the analysis** — Continue incremental runs on new calls to keep counts and trends current.

## How to use the detail

- **PM_SUMMARY.md** — Product-level summary and “what this means for product.”
- **THEME_ASKS_SUMMARY.md** — Grouped customer asks per theme.
- **counts/summary.json** — Totals and top themes.
- **counts/by_theme.json** — Counts and which calls support each theme (evidence).
- **counts/trends.json** — Monthly breakdown of signal volume by theme.

Themes are derived from customer language; no pre-set taxonomy was used.
