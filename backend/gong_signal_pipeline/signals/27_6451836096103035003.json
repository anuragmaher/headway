      "Theme": "Contract Flexibility",
      "Sub-Theme": "Two-year commitment",
      "Ask": "We need flexibility to avoid long-term commitments due to ongoing changes within our organization.",
      "Priority": "High",
      "Evidence": "Full transparency. I don't think we're going to be looking for a two year contract. Nothing against hiver. We love the tool. We use it. Just a lot of changes going on within AGM, and I don't feel comfortable making the two year commitment at this point."
