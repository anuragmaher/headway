      "Priority": "High",
      "Evidence": "I love this AI feature in Zendesk, it's not like this. I like that the agent has the ability to go back and forth in Zendesk. It just reads everything and it spits something out there's, no additional interaction. So, I love it like this. So we want to use the AI for this, but we also want to use the AI before it even reaches an agent before a ticket is created."
