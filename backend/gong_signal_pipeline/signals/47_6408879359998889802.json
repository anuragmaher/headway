      "Ask": "We need a shared interface for WhatsApp to manage messages more efficiently.",
      "Priority": "Medium",
      "Evidence": "Right now, it's our team leader who's handling all the WhatsApp messages. But sometimes if he's too busy, he will just forward the message to one of us and then we have to answer for him. But it's a lot of back and forth like forwarding. So it would be easier if we could just have a shared interface for WhatsApp."
