      "Ask": "We need the ability to use Hiver with our existing email setup, which includes both Outlook and Gmail accounts.",
      "Priority": "High",
      "Evidence": "So on hiver, you either have to be on outlook or Gmail, right? Currently, you are like, it's a mix like your individual emails are on outlook and your shared email is on Gmail. And that too with a different domain. So, and with this setup, hiver will not be able to suffice as it will not work with hybrid because hybrid needs, either you are on Google workspace completely or you are on Microsoft completely."
