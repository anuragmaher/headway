      "Ask": "We need the ability to separate email and chat correspondence in our shared inbox to improve organization and efficiency.",
      "Priority": "High",
      "Evidence": "It's such a silly thing, but it doesn't separate those in an inbox. So if you're in a shared inbox, all emails and chats are just kind of like lumped into one communication funnel, which makes it next to impossible to organize yourself as an employee."
