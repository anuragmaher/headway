    {
      "Theme": "Shared Inbox Management",
      "Ask": "We need better ways to manage a shared inbox to avoid chaos when clients respond.",
      "Priority": "High",
      "Evidence": "I'd love to see that… not happen. So, you know, like when somebody communicates that it comes back to them specifically."
    },
    {
      "Theme": "Reporting and Analytics",
      "Ask": "We require metrics on first response time, resolution time, and the number of emails assigned and closed.",
      "Priority": "High",
      "Evidence": "These are ones that I'd want to see first response and resolution time, but also how many emails are assigned and closed is a big one."

      "Evidence": "Seven days? Seems like a short time to see if you like it or get metrics."
    },
    {
      "Theme": "Customer Service Transition",
      "Ask": "We are not ready to transition from Zoho to Hiver immediately and want to explore other options.",
      "Priority": "Low",
      "Evidence": "We're not jumping to anything. So I don't want to schedule any – anything… next, just curious about costs though."
