      "Priority": "Medium",
      "Evidence": "I think for a trial, it might be a bit easier cause we have about, I think 900 articles… but yeah, that's another thing that maybe, yeah, we would move the knowledge base as well to you guys, if that would be, you know, more commercially interesting for us to do it under one system as opposed to multiple different ones?"
