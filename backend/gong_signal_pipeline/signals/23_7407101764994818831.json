      "Ask": "We need a way to collaborate and work together on emails without having to extract it and take it into spreadsheets and other documents.",
      "Priority": "High",
      "Evidence": "So to boil it down, it's pretty much look sometimes as I mentioned, sometimes if all of the documentation and all of the information comes in correctly, then there's a chance that we don't have to interact with anybody, right? So the administration team and the finance team can do it all themselves. But a lot of the times I would say maybe the majority of times there needs to be, a cross team collaboration in order to like take something to completion."
