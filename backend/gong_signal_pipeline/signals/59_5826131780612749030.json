      "Ask": "We need the tagging system to adapt and change based on the conversation flow, not just the initial email.",
      "Priority": "High",
      "Evidence": "The initial email is a customer asking for a quote. So, let's say I add the smart tagging, the AI tagging and it would say quote, but then the customer sends us the tender. So now it's not a quote. It's a load to enter. And in a week or two, the customer is asking for information on where the load is. So the tagging will change to etas or so will they change?"
