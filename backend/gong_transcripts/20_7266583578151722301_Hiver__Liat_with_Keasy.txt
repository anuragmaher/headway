Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hello?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hello?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hey, Liat, can you hear me?

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Yes. Hi. How are you doing? Sorry?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm doing good. How are you doing today?

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Good. Happy Friday. Happy.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Friday, indeed. I just want to make sure I'm getting your name, right? Did I pronounce your first name, right?

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Yeah, you did it's. Liat. And honestly, nobody pronounced it right? So well done.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Thank you so much. Hey, I'm Raghav, quick introductions underway. I'm with the hiver account management team here, been with the business for eight years and for today, you're going to be your host. There. We go. All right. See, I just thought I'd put a face to the name. So, for today, I noticed that you'd shown interest in talking more about hiver. I didn't notice any additional information on the invite. So, wait, let's just video off if that's easier.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Let me tell you, let me tell you because I'm going to, I think my camera is like slow enough. Can you hear me well?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I can hear loud and clear, but let's go back to video off if that's easier because I don't want to.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Yeah, because my video, I don't know what's going on here today. Actually. I do know a tree just fell in my driveway anyways. I am good with hiver.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  I don't need anything except my software tells me that my trial is over. So I'm happy to pay you guys more for the AI at least for now, but I didn't see any option to it. It just tell me trial over.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, got it. Yeah. Got it. So to clarify the AI add on is at a 20 dollar per user per month additional cost over your subscription in itself. And if you're good to go ahead, I just need your confirmation. I can go ahead with enabling it after the call today. I can just get it done.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  I mean, can I, I'm assuming I can downgrade later if I want to?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, you can always just write back to us. Let us know if you're no longer interested in it and we can have it canceled and disabled.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Well, I definitely want it. So go ahead and enable it. I was speaking to you a couple of times there's some upgrades obviously that you need to do on your end for this to work. Well, the thing doesn't have personas yet, you know, I try to manipulate the database but I don't think it's working that well, so, but I also am happy to help you improve this because at the end, it's beautiful and I want to use it. So it's me with the chat.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, perfect. So Liat, the one other thing that I wanted to check with you was I did notice that you're on the monthly version of our pro plan, are you open to switching to an annual plan as well like an annual contract? And that would actually drop your, sorry?

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Yeah. What's the saving looks like?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. Sure. So just give me one minute to do the quick math. So you're right now at our pro monthly cost. So that's at ust per person, the pro annuals are actually at ust. So for like five people, you're basically going to be dropping about ust per month or about ust per year is what you'll be saving just on the pro annual cost.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  And this covers, I currently have five usls.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So it covers the entire subscription. This will be just for switching from monthly to the annual contract. And then the 20 dollar for the AI add on will be additional on top of this.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  All right. So yeah, let's do an annual contract that's fine.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So just to clarify if we continue with the AI add on monthly, you're looking at a 79 ust per month billing. Whereas if you switch to annual, you're looking at 65. So 70 dollar savings on the whole contract and you will be contracted for one year on both the pro and the AI add on as.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Well, and I don't it's not a pay in advance. It's just a commitment for one year, correct?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no. So that was the other bit. So if I do switch you to the annual contract, it will be a single upfront payment for the whole year. So that means you are looking at, let me just do the exact math, right? So you're looking at a single payment of 2,700 dollars for the pro plan and a payment of 2,940 total for the pro annual and the AI bundle.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Okay. So I cannot do prepayments right now. I don't mind taking a one year commitment, but I can't pay three grand out of pockets right now for many reasons. So I guess keep me on the monthly then.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Let me do that. Let me keep you there when you are ready for switching to the annual. Just drop me an email.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  All right. Sounds good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. Liat. Anything else you wanted to chat about?

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Nope, that's it. I have a couple of your team's emails that I send feedback when I have time, but honestly, I also don't even have time to send feedback. It's all good. You guys keep doing what you're doing. We like your product.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thank you so much for that. Love. Let me go ahead and make the changes, send you a confirmation email, and I'll let you go. Enjoy the rest of your Friday. Thank you.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Have a good weekend.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Cheers you too. Bye bye.

Liat Arama (liat@keasy.ai):
  Bye bye.
