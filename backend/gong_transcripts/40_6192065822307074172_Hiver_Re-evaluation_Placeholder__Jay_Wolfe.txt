Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi. Is this Jenny?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hello?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hello?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Hi, Jenny. I can hear you. Can you hear me now?

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Yes, I just changed the microphone source there. Yes, I can hear you. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Great. How have you been doing?

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Yeah, good. Thank you… had a break for Christmas and new year. So just back to work this week. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Great. I think we had, we last connected. I think around November wherein we explored the solution as the team grows. Currently, you mentioned that, you know, you're handling multiple inboxes by yourself and you were expecting to have more people to be part of this team to sort of, you know, have a more streamlined way of handling these. So, yeah, has anything changed since then? How would you like to proceed with the evaluation at this point? If you could just help me fill the gap so that accordingly, you?

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Know. Yeah, sure. So we have a new team member joining in the middle of February. So at that point, I think when I spoke to you before, we were still recruiting, but we've filled the role now.

InfoShop4Tanks:
  So they will be starting in February. So that will be the sort of the launchpad for when I'll need to have a solution in place. I am still interested in hiver as a, as an option and I think just the free plan probably looks like it does all that I need it to do. I just wanted to know really how, what's involved to integrate it. I'm concerned from a security point of view, I have like a email… screening system set up on our current emails and just want to make sure that everything is compatible with that. Still, I'm not particularly it techie. So I'm not really sure what questions I need to ask you to check with my it team, but perhaps you can just sort of explain how the sort of integration works?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's pretty simple. You just have to use your Gmail credentials and you can just download the hiver Chrome extension that's where it works, and then you will just have it on your Gmail itself. And then from there, you can just create the multiple. You mentioned that you need multiple shared inboxes. But in the free plan, we only allow one inbox. So will that be enough for you?

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Okay. So I think I need three inboxes… going into the thing. Okay? So that would be then a paid solution. Okay? So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That if you need three, then we'll be looking at the pro plan because growth plan also accommodates up to two shared inboxes. So if I just pull the pricing for you, so give you one shared inbox, and then you can add multiple users and growth will be accommodating up to two shared inboxes, and for each, the cost will be 25 dollars per user per month. So if you're going to be two of, you and the later your colleague will also join. So it's going to cost you 50 dollars per month. If it's more than two and up to five, then you'll be in the pro plan.

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Fine. Okay. And so, so we will have just to confirm. So there's three users and three email inboxes. So that would be covered under that. If.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  it's three users. Then since we sell in a bucket of five, so you'll have to buy five licenses, minimum. It's two licenses that you can opt for. If it's above two, then the next bucket that you'll be falling in is five. And likewise the increment of five.

InfoShop4Tanks:
  So that's still covered under the pro plan. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes. And.

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Then the three, three different email addresses that they would need to be. Okay. Fine. Okay. So that makes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  sense. Yeah. So that would in the program, yeah.

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Yeah. So I think I remember that it, yeah. So it runs as a in Chrome, but so… in effect, is it like it's diverting? So, the emails that are received into outlook will then be forwarded into the, your portal if we call it that. And so any kind of security screening that we have that will happen still as normal before it gets to outlook. So won't be affected by going into hiver? No?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No. So hiver is actually just copying those emails from your portal and then giving you a view here. So since you're hosted on outlook or using Microsoft, you'll be logging into this URL app, hiverhq. Com. This is our interface. You'll be logging in using your own credentials and then you will create the shared inbox, like these are the shared inbox that I am part of today. So likewise, we will create three of these connected with the, you know, designated email addresses that you would like to connect, add all three users into these. And that's it, you can just start managing these inboxes right within hiver while your outlook accounts remain as it is. And those emails are going to remain in those accounts itself.

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Okay. Yeah, I see, right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And from the security perspective, we have this, you know, laid out on the website itself. So in case you want to get it checked from the, it that's what it talks about, you know, we'll be looking at hiver only in your case since you're hosted on Microsoft. So it's about the data privacy and all the compliances that we have in order to make sure that your data is saved and protected.

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's important. Okay. So I think the only thing there is, I thought I would be able to get away with the free plan, but it looks like it's a costed option. So I just, I think I will just review everything in that pro plan to take a look as I say, I don't need it until middle of February. So I'll just… use the next couple of weeks just to review it a bit further. Yeah?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Like at first glance?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Like, do you think this could probably fit into the budget or does it seem too steep for you? Any first impression that you? Yeah.

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Possibly too steep. Yeah. So I'm just going to have… a look… at it and just consider it a bit more. It does seem that it does what I want it to do, but, it might be that we just need to muddle on at least initially without that outlet, but, I will look at it again. Probably. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Sure. Like, well, I think in the middle of feb, I think we can wait till then and whenever you're ready, and if you would like to re, evaluate it at that point, yeah, just let me know and then we can reconnect and then take this forward. Yeah, lovely.

InfoShop4Tanks:
  Thank you very much. No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries. Thank you. Take care. Bye.
