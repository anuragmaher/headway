================================================================================

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, josh. This is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Yeah. How you doing?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good. How you doing?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, appreciate you joining here. The agenda for the call today. Wanted to just spend the first five minutes or so. Getting an understanding about you, your company, maybe some reasons that kind of interested you in taking this meeting today. And then from there, I can walk through the product and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Yeah, sounds great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, yeah, josh, tell me a little bit about, was there anything that was top of mind that interested you and kind of taking this meeting?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  You know, I had looked at hiver quite a while ago, and it kind of fell off my radar and I meant to reacquaint myself before this call and I just kind of ran out of time but I do not currently have a help desk solution. It's just me in it and I do have two people in our HR team that might get some benefit out of a ticketing system. It's something I've been kind of asking for a little while now and I've never really gotten like approval to move forward. It's always been kind of lukewarm reception and I would, the argument I would make is like, I don't really have a ton of volume but it's handy for helping like track things, you know, just trying to track through email and slack and spreadsheets and all that I find to be rather difficult and I do not like Asana as a help desk tool. So, I primarily, I'm kind of living out of email and slack.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Absolutely. So. Okay. So, you're not using anything right now. You don't have Zendesk or anything like that?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  So, we have Zendesk for our public facing support team, like for our product, that support team?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  is of such a cost that I don't think I would get support for it and also like Zendesk, I feel like it's a little bit of overkill for what? Like we would really need it for.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. And yeah, you're using Gmail, Google suite company.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. But yeah, let me go ahead and just kind of catch you back up to what hiver does and, you know, the benefits of it. But yeah, like you said, it's you know, can help you manage your emails, help you track them better and potentially help the other HR team as well. Can you see my screen?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, we're a certified Google partner. You simply download the hiver extension. Once you download the extension, you're going to see these yellow icons in the top right here. And then you're going to see these yellow icons down here as well. So you're going to be answering your personal emails just like normal in your Gmail. Except now you're going to have really easy access to those other channels. One of the main channels that hiver supports is email. So do you have like a shared email address that people reach out to you at?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  I don't but the HR team does.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yep. So if you or the HR team basically, we connect that shared email address to a folder. And that way everything's organized within that hiver folder about those HR emails that they're getting. So basically I'll just come in here. When somebody emails hiver, it's going to first land in the unassigned folder here. And then when you open it up, now, when you open up these emails, you're going to have this hiver panel on the right hand side. And from here, you can go ahead and assign it to each other. Once you assign it to someone, they're going to get notified that this email has been assigned to them. So we know who's accountable for this email. There's statuses open pending closed. So, you know, the status of these emails, and then there's also tags which will let you know the category of this email. And these tags and assigning can be automated via automations. Also, we have AI as well which can categorize these emails and assign them to the right person also. So for instance, if one person on the HR team handles all the payroll questions, basically, any type of payroll email that comes in, we can have it automatically get assigned to that person.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then it can be categorized with the tags here as well.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  So it's using AI to determine that it's a payroll question like how's it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we have both, we could do it with the automations. So the AI is an add on. So, yes, we can do it with the AI. And then the other way we could do it if you didn't want the add on is just via automations. Things. Basically, hiver can read the emails. And if any keywords come in that mention, you know, payroll mention anything payroll related, hiver can recognize that and automatically assign it to the right person. And then the other way we could do it is with, the AI can read these emails, summarize them. And then based on those summaries, have them automatically sent to the right person.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. And then, you know, same with the tags can get automatically applied as well. And then also here's the notes section, this is where you can do notes and then you hit the at mention button, everyone's name pops up and it's like, hey, can you help on this? So you can direct message each other within these emails. Obviously only for the hiver, people can see so that you can go back and forwards on them.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  The other benefit to using hiver is that obviously, you can reply to these emails right here. You no longer have to CC each other or forward these emails to each other. Once they're in the hiver folder, everybody in that folder can see the responses.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay. And you can assign who gets what folders?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay, great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We have email templates. So kind of for those like reoccurring emails that you might get just to save you time here, some more AI features is like an AI chat gpt. And then probably our most popular AI feature here is the AI copilot which can actually draft replies for you. It learns from the context of the emails that you've been getting it's. Going to ask you a three prompt question. You choose the prompt that you want, and it will go ahead and draft it up. It can also reference a knowledge base or documents that you have to provide more contextual answers.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Is that knowledge base exist within hiver, or can it reference Google docs or how's that work?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it could do either. Okay. Yeah. So you could actually build a knowledge base within hiver… it can be internal or external facing… and, you know, you'd have your logo and stuff up here, but this is what ours looks like.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then the other benefit to using hiver is this team view here. This allows you to see all the open emails across this folder and who's working on them, right? So let's just pretend this was the HR folder, HR email. So in the HR email right now, I mean, I know you only have about two people working it, but basically, this shows me, okay, I have 23 emails that have not been closed out. I can see who's working on them, right? Cole has four. I have four, Rakesh has 11. I could click on any of Rakesh's emails here. I could see when it came in, any changes that were made to it, any responses that happened to it, I could reply to it. And then, you know, also Rakesh is out for the day. He's sick. I could easily come in here and handle these emails for him or I can even take all of his work since he's going to be out this week and assign them to somebody else.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But that's the other good thing too is you can just pick up where other people left off. You can see completely see, you know, the status of everything, you know, you don't have to really do much after that point. We also have slas, you can set up. So this will let you know which emails are late. So you can see these red lightning bolts here. So they could be like if nobody responds to this email within two hours, we want to be notified that this email is late.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So that's what it's showing you down here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And we have a lot of different native integrations. We also have an open API as well… here's. A list of our integrations that we have… not sure if we're using many of these on a kind of day to day basis.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  I am definitely using slack and we have some zapier.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Yeah. Can you talk about what the slack integration does?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So we're working, on, adding more things to it. But currently, what the slack notification does very, simply, is it just sends you notifications in slack? So, if, you know, you get a new email or different statuses, change, you can get notified in slack.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay. Is there, is there, any plans of being able to like take a slack conversation and turn it into a ticket or?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yep. You can imagine that is a very common ask that we get here. It is on the roadmap. It's high priority as well, just because, yeah, so many companies that we talk to, want to do the same thing. So yeah, it is high priority. It's on the roadmap. I guess it's a bit more difficult than I think it is. So, but yeah, it's on the roadmap. I believe it should come out maybe early next year, but I'll have to double check.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay. Do you know, I mean, just out of curiosity, do you know how long it's been like kind of, in the pipeline?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Honestly, it has really, it has really been escalated this past month or so. Becoming a priority. Okay. So, yeah, it's it is, it's recently become more of a priority. You know, hiver, we have over 2000 customers ranging from small businesses, some of the largest companies in the world, capital one openai. Some of our customers have over a 1,000 licenses with us. But, you know, as we continue to scale and go up market, you can imagine that this, the slack ask has become a real priority. And, and the way just that hiver is growing so fast right now that, it's definitely a priority, but I'll get, I can get a more, hopefully, a more finite timeline for you and I'll include that in the email I sent.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that'd be great. Cause honestly, I know a lot from the HR team, but I get more through slack than email at this.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Point, sure. Absolutely. I know as I've worked in many tech companies and it's just really easy to just slack the it person as opposed to.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  I've unfortunately reinforced that behavior.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  But it's hard to walk back now. You know what I mean?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, totally. Totally. Yep, very aware with that. Yep, perfect. So, yeah, I'll get back to that too. And then really, the other main thing that people use hiver for is the analytics.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Yeah. This is where I was going to go next to.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You basically select the folder or the different folders that you want to see. You select the timeframe. It could be custom, could be 90 days. And then you're going to see a bunch of information. You can slice and dice this data however you want.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We also have prebuilt reports already built out. But basically, you can see things like okay, in the last month, you know, we got 248 emails to this address in the past month. We resolved 237 emails. Like I said, you can group this data however you want. If you want to see, okay in the past month, what are the types of emails that we got? You know, in the past month? We got 97 emails about billing questions. We got 39 emails about cancellations, 16 emails about feature requests, right? Who's working on these emails?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So you could filter for that. You could filter for any custom fields tags, however you want, you can save these views as well. You can download them et cetera. And then our prebuilt ones. So you don't have to slice and dice that stuff is the workload. So you can see like the workload across the team. The past month, we've assigned 130 emails to call. You can see how many emails your team sent out. You could see everybody's you know, response times, resolution times. You can also do customer satisfaction surveys as well. Here's, that tag reporting again, just to show you the types of emails that you've gotten in that selected timeframe contacts. So the companies that have emailed in, the people that have emailed in… the SLA reporting. So this will allow you to see like the compliance and violations against those slas. So like how well people are doing with responding within that timeframe… customer satisfaction surveys. This is the AI sentiment analysis. So those were kind of all those like happy faces and things that you saw in all those emails. It's just letting you know the sentiment of the email. And then you can build custom reports again, any type of reporting that you want to see based on different filters for people tags, timeframe, et cetera. This is all exportable to a CSV file. And then we also have the ability to create custom dashboards.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay. Interesting. So I'm curious with this, the way you guys are set up, how?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  What's.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  the process like that, if like I need to create a ticket on someone else's behalf… I'll give you an example. I have a project that I've got to swap everybody over to our new MDM so that's really I'm driving it. But it would be really handy if I could have a ticket for every individual person that I need to like get ahold of to switch them out and be able to track the different stages of where I'm at. So it's kind of pseudo product and project management. But it's also kind of just, you know, an it ticket cause it's a very repeatable like contact the person, get them to install the thing, you know, reboot their computer. You know what I mean? Is there something I can do that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, there's only two ways to create tickets within hiver, right there's. Emailing, right? So you email into the shared email address, and that creates obviously a ticket within hiver. The only other thing that although way to create tickets is, and again, I don't necessarily think this is exactly what you're asking.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Is there is a ticket, there is a portal that you can create?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Oh, okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And you can make it, you know, different criteria here. But as far as your question is, like… you know, kind of creating like a project ticket, not really. Yeah, not really. These are just the two ways to create the tickets. And then as far as like project management goes, we do have integrations with different project management tools for that.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay. Well, what about, for example, like you got Karen sitting there? What if Karen forwarded that email and it's really somebody else that needs help. Can you reassign who the like the requester is?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Reassign who the requester is,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'd have to double check. I'm pretty sure. Yeah, you can just, you can just forward it, change it. You can, you can add in the notes here as well that it's a different requester?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Oh, okay. So, if I forwarded, like if Karen wrote in and said, hey, I'm opening this ticket for Steve. If I forwarded it to Steve, then the ticket would be Steve's at that point, is that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, yeah, actually, yeah, definitely. And, you know, just because Karen emailed in here, doesn't necessarily mean that, that's necessarily, Karen's ticket, right? It, basically, what hiver does is hiver just takes an email and turns it into a ticket. But yeah, I mean, Karen can email in on behalf of Steve or whatever, as long as it's you know, visible that it's at Steve's there. It'll, show that.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. But basically, what I'm saying is just because Karen emails into hiver, doesn't necessarily have to mean that it's this is Karen's ticket.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay. Got it. Right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Cause Karen can email in and say, hey, we need, you know, we need a new, we need a new monitor for Steve, right? Then, you know?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  We need a new monitor.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  For Steve, got it. And then, yeah, the other thing, you know, the reasons, that people use hiver is we have 24 seven support. We, you can get on the phone call with, someone here at hiver fairly quickly as well. Instant chat support goes to a real person here at hiver and it's you know, it's easy to use, right? Like you said, you know, Zendesk is very clunky. It's you know, not necessarily, you need that, maybe you just need more of a better way to manage these emails, which is kind of how hiver works, right? And it's easy to set up, you download hiver, you go into the settings, you connect the emails to these folders, and, you know, your life.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Oh, that's a good question. So these emails, do, you know, do they have to actually be, email accounts or can I use Google groups?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You can use Google groups, okay?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Great. Cause that would be an added cost if I had to spin up, you know, actual licensed accounts.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  For everybody, yep, absolutely. It can be an email or a group. And, when you connect it, it's going to ask you that it's going to say, hey, are you connecting an email or are you connecting a group?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Very cool. On the AI, around… you know, security and privacy rights. Is our data being used to train your?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  AI model? No, no, it's, just specific, to your, instance.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay, cool.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. And as far as I said, like, I can send over our security information. You know, we work with fortune 500 companies, et cetera. Soc two compliant iso certified GDPR, everything.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Block.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, as far as pricing goes, it's all on our site here, we have different packages. Growth and pro would be the two that you're looking at pros a bit more expensive just cause it has added features. So, these are the added features that it has. Based on our convo today, I don't know if there was anything that would make me think that you were a pro, maybe if you wanted to do those customer satisfaction surveys, that's a pro feature.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But really, the best way to do it is just to start a free trial, seven day free trial, test it out. That way you can see, which features are best for you. And then, you know, before you make a purchase, you can decide if you want growth or pro. The only add on that we have is for the AI, we include all the AI, everything's included, even the stuff that's coming out soon, and it's an additional 20 dollars, per person per month for the AI.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And if you look at other help desk solutions, you know, they're charging a lot more for, this type of AI. Even just that co, pilot, the thing that can just write responses, a lot of, a lot of companies are charging like upwards of 60 dollars a person, to have something like that.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Oh, that R, D'S gotta get paid for.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's, not easy. I guess.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  All right. Good stuff. So I'll warn you, we're a little slow, and, I like the looks of this product. I, I'm really, very interested to see when your zoom or zoom, sorry, slack integration comes out because I think that would kind of be like the killer feature like, hey, if it does both email and slack, that would encompass our two major, you know, influx of requests. So, I think that would be really good. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Let me actually message this person right now before I forget about the slack integration. Any idea about slack?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And you want to like create tickets from slack, right?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Yeah, that would be my, my main goal.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  All right. Just ask someone. So, yeah, hopefully, they'll know.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  And really, the big thing, is like, it would be a much less of a culture shift because everybody's trying to email me instead of slack, me would probably be impossible.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, very familiar. We have, what's it called? Like, sales ops, we have, you know, got people who run the sales ops. So basically sales people, you know, there's a process, to, if you have an issue, to get, you know, send an email or fill out this task and click up et cetera. But, we, you know, everything's immediate. So, we're like, hey, we need this. I need you to help me do this. I need this quote fixed trying to, you know, sign somebody up, you know? So, yeah, totally makes sense. Perfect. Josh. Well, I'll email all this to you here and then, you know, like when, potentially, if I got you a timeline on the slack thing like when potentially, would you be open to trying giving, like trying the trial maybe?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Yeah, I think, once… this, I'll probably wait for the slack integration, to be perfectly honest with you just because, I think just email is not enough to get the rest of the team excited about it. And I think, right, I think this is worth, if we're gonna do this, it's worth us all doing it, not just me doing it, but I would probably be ready to like look at a trial, you know, early January, February if, if it's available by then.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, absolutely. And when you say all of us do it, is that the, you and the two HR people or is that more?

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  It's definitely me and the two HR folks. I'm also kind of thinking after looking at it, I wonder if there's a few people on our finance team that might get some benefit out of it, but I would, that's conversations I'd have to have.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, finance is honestly one of, our best most popular use cases. So, any like billing addresses, finance, addresses, accounts, payable accounts, receivable, we have integrations with Netsuite, they might be using Netsuite, or quickbooks as well, but, yeah.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Quickbooks. Yeah. Finance is a very.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  popular, use case for us.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  And, I think even for them, it would, they have multiple mailboxes that are all looked at by the same, you know, one or two people, right? So just being able to not have to have them log into so many different mailboxes might be really helpful for them too.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Absolutely. Okay. Perfect. Well, I'll email everything over to you. If I don't hear from you, I'll just circle back maybe early next year and, we'll take it from there all.

Joshua Goss (josh.goss@noredink.com):
  Right. Sounds great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks so much, josh. Have a good one. You too. Thanks bye.
