Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  so far? So good.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Good. How?

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  About you?

Michael John Ventresca:
  Good, but busy had some traveling. So, I feel like the year hasn't really started for me until like this week and.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  isn't it also like everything that you did in December, you're like that's like a 20 26 issue. And now it's like this is our issue now.

Michael John Ventresca:
  It's a 20 27 issue.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Exactly. Yeah. All right. Thank you so much for setting this up. I know we got all the approvals.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Yeah. Today, what I was hoping to do is one just again get reacquainted here. Secondly, I shared hiver's onboarding program yesterday, just want to confirm.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Yes, I saw it. Sorry, yes, I saw it. Yeah, yeah.

Michael John Ventresca:
  No worries. No, there's no rush to get it done, you know, before this call, but if you can just take a look at that and pre fill out any information that you already know, that's just going to help us implement hiver a little bit more quickly, you know, if we understand things like kind of what you're looking to get out of hiver and how things should be assigned xyz, right?

Michael John Ventresca:
  There should be a questionnaire. It should be fairly straightforward. Anything that you're not sure of. We can always chat through on our next call when we actually discuss your use case, right? So don't feel that you have to put something down if you don't know yet. It's something we can discuss on a call.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  All right, perfect. I'll make sure it's good. Sounds.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Good. Second thing on my agenda today was to make sure that we get you set up with a trial. So how this will work since we're going to be having the HR team on a completely separate instance. What I'll have you do today is sign up for a trial of hiver. Okay? From there, I'll have my team on the back end, convert it into a paid account associated with flexport, again completely separate though and siloed, and then I'll make sure that we transfer three licenses in for you.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Okay, perfect.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Cool. So… that's the plan for today. We can again discuss if there's time permitting. We'll discuss a bit of your use case as well to give us a bit of a head start. But was there anything on your agenda you were hoping to cover today?

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  No, I'm just excited, to get started. Yeah.

Michael John Ventresca:
  For sure. All right. Well, I will go ahead and please share your screen. Daleth and I'll walk you through starting a trial.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Okay, perfect. Let me just… get a window open.

Michael John Ventresca:
  And then by the way, too, while you're doing that, I do have Raghav on the call as well. I know it's been a couple months since we all spoke. So, just as a reminder, I'm your customer success manager. So I'm here to make sure you know, help with implementation and make sure things are going well. And really, you're going to tell me your goals. My job is to get you there, right to simple to be really simple about it. Raghav is also aligned on your account as your account manager, while he is also here to help out with goals. He'll be your point of contact as well for anything commercial, right? So, I know we're starting right now with three folks in HR in three to six months. If, you know, leadership, hears about all the great things you all are doing and decides they want to explore hiver for some additional shared mailboxes, Raghav will be your point of contact for that, right? So, anything commercially minded?

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Okay, perfect. No, it makes sense.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Pleasure meeting you, daleth, excited to get your team on board.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Yeah, I'm excited too. Okay. Let me see. Okay. Just Chrome, I assume just whatever we're using?

Michael John Ventresca:
  Yes, perfect. Okay. Now, we can go ahead and go to hiver pricing.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Hiver rising.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Hiver, hiver space pricing?

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Hiver pricing. Yeah.

Michael John Ventresca:
  We're just gonna get you to the pricing page right there… and then we can press start free trial over on the elite hiver, elite. So this will be your work email will be your personal work email. So this would be daleth, it's okay?

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Okay, perfect. So here, okay?

Michael John Ventresca:
  Yes. Okay. You get Google?

Michael John Ventresca:
  You can just put email.

Michael John Ventresca:
  And now we'll go ahead and press add to Chrome here.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Oh, you cannot see my other window? No, wait. Let me see how I can fix that.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Yeah, yeah. Just one?

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Second, let me just share. I think… one moment… too many taps open. Sorry.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Okay.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Let me share my screen.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  There we go. Okay?

Michael John Ventresca:
  It's coming up right now. Okay?

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  I think it's seems like it's already there, okay?

Michael John Ventresca:
  So, you should be good to go. We can press the little X to get out of this window… and then do it one more time. It's a little X. I'm sorry. So we already have the Chrome extension. I think we've changed our flow here. So you can X this out. We don't need this window. Okay? And then likewise X out this window. Oh.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  This one. Yeah.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Now, let's go ahead and press start free trial once more. Let's just see if it.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Now we'll press continue here. Press continue here. Email… continue. We've already done this. So what the hell? Please go to your Gmail. We've definitely changed our trial signup flow because.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  I think I have still hiver here from the other account. Maybe that's, it.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Could be, it, can you press that once? And now press log into hiver? Oh, wait, what happened? Okay. You're good there? Now, press it again, the little hiver icon. Now, we are in, okay… we need to get you removed from the main account.

Michael John Ventresca:
  So, right now, you're in the main flexport account?

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Yeah, exactly.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Your email, when we try to create a trial or sign you up, right? You're already associated with an account. So we need to get you removed from this account, so we can start a trial account. And right now, there's no way to press switch account. Raghav, anything. Have you ran into this before? Are we just going to need to have an admin at flexport remove daleth from the main account? Yeah, I think we'd probably need to do that or bump daleth's permission to an admin on the main account.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Yes.

Michael John Ventresca:
  We can't do that. Alright? So, daleth, we are a bit stuck here. I am actually meeting with Rachel Wallace in about two hours.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Oh, I'll.

Michael John Ventresca:
  just have her remove you from the account. I'll send you an email once that's done, and from there, you should be able to create a trial account. But likely, what I'll do is I'll have Rachel remove you, and then I will just start a thread with my support team to make sure we have resources to help us in case we run into issues again, shall.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  I quickly check if she's online and ask her right away. Would that be helpful?

Michael John Ventresca:
  That would be helpful, right? We could get it done right now. Hi.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Rachel, just sending her a slack message, sure.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  To remove me from the main account?

Michael John Ventresca:
  You.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  okay. Let me see what she says… because then that will probably be, it. Is there a way for me to remove it? Would that be helpful? Also? No removing.

Michael John Ventresca:
  The Chrome extension won't matter. It's because your Gmail account is associated with a hiver account. We need to sever that association, which… would require you being deleted from the main account.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Gotcha. Okay. Also check if she is available right now.

Michael John Ventresca:
  She might be on lunch. It's noon where she's at, oh, like.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Exactly. This half hour is blocked in her calendar indeed.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Yeah. I had a feeling.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Okay. Oh, true. Okay. She's also not, I mean, she is online but she isn't so.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Okay. So I would just have to set up the free account, and then you can do the magic on the back end, right? Yes. Okay. And that's the first step?

Michael John Ventresca:
  I will still.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Continue to do the steps that you were sending me an email about just to get myself onboarded right? With the goals and everything. Yes. Yeah.

Michael John Ventresca:
  That should be your next step is, yeah… doing the onboarding plan and then getting set up on a hiver free trial. So again, first step for that will be getting yourself removed from the main flexport account. Once that's done, if you just want to shoot me an email again or maybe when I speak with Rachel today, I'll just have her do it.

Michael John Ventresca:
  If she doesn't get back to you, regardless. Once it's confirmed that you are removed, then we can setting up the free trial. Once the trial is created. I'll have my team again convert it to a paid account with three users. And from there, we will start implementation, right? So you filling out the onboarding program will help guide the implementation. I'll likely also ask a ton of questions during the implementation, just to figure out really what we're trying to do is map out the journey of an email, right? When you receive an email, who should it go to, what steps need to be taken? What data do you want to track? How do you want to reply? How do you want to collaborate? What signals that an email is done? What happens when it's completed, right? We'll map out all of that to figure out really, just to help ensure that you're getting value out of hiver, right? And things are running efficiently? So that's kind of what it looks like with a team of your size, we should be able to do that fairly quickly. So I think we can be live here in the next two weeks wow.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  That will be amazing.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Yeah. But again, as a first step, we'll just need to get you removed from the account, start the trial, fill out the onboarding program, and then we'll go from there.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Okay, perfect. Sounds good. Sorry about this, like I wasn't aware that was a part of it, but I, yeah, either Rachel will reply to me within two hours or you'll talk to her in two hours. Yeah, either way, I will be removed from the main account today.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Perfect. Yeah. Sorry about that too. Like we must have just changed the way that trial signups work because normally, it would just create a new account and you'd have the option to switch between the two, but, it's not happening this time. So, I think we must have changed something. So it's.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  probably one of those 20 26 things, right? Yeah… we're all good. All good. Thank you so much for your patience with us. And I, yes, let's there, there's nothing else that we can do at this moment, right? We just need to wait for Rachel.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Yeah, we need to wait for Rachel. Okay?

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Okay. Perfect. Well, thank you. Both. Let's wait for Rachel and then I'll let you know as soon as I hear from her or vice versa. Probably, yes, when that is done.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Sounds good. Yeah. And then we'll go from there and we can schedule it a call again later this week or really early next once we have this ready.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Yeah, perfect.

Michael John Ventresca:
  Sounds good. All right. Well, have a good rest of your night.

Dalith Knetemann (dknetemann@flexport.com):
  Thank you so much. Have a great one. Yeah, bye bye bye.
