  hey, Rachel. Hi, how are you? Good. How are you? I'm doing well. Where are you calling out of Texas? Nice. Whereabouts, my wife actually just left for Houston this morning. We're around Dallas. Okay. Very cool. And I think we're waiting on a couple more here, right? Yes. I'm just asking them right now. Okay? Cool.

Rachel Maygren (rachel@thetcsource.com):
  Cole, my boss just texted me and said I didn't I get in at 10, so I just logged on to the meeting. First thing. She said that she's not available. Now this morning, she asked if she could, she had sent an email asking if she could move the meeting to next week to Monday around noon or one, would that be possible? Let's see Monday at, and that is noon central. Yeah, central. Huh. So that would be two o'clock eastern. I believe it should be one o'clock or one o'clock difference, right? Yeah. I can do, I can't do one o'clock next week, but I can do one 30. Okay? One 30 Eastern Time? Yes. Okay. And that works for y'all. Yep, we can do that. Okay. Awesome. So I'll just send that over for one 30 eastern, but I appreciate you hopping on here real quick. All right. Thank you. All right. Take care. Bye.
