Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Katie. How are you?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Hello, I'm okay. Thank you. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Thank you. Shall we get started with the discussion or expecting more people as well?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  No, just me. So feel free to get started. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Thank you firstly for scheduling this meeting with us. My name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver as well as your point of contact, we'll be helping you with the evaluation going forward. So as we get started, I would first love to understand in terms of what made you look out for a tool like hiver, what is it that you're currently trying to solve accordingly? I can sort of tailor the demonstration for you. Yeah.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Sure. So we have, I mean we have a few shared mailbox boxes but there are one, the… email is info. So basically all of the generic information, all of the generic queries and things go into this mailbox and it's managed by our reception team and there's just a lot of things that are getting missed or being picked up by someone. And then the rest of the team aren't touching it. But that person's not in for another week, you know, like all this kind of stuff where things are slipping. And so I was just having a conversation with someone and they recommended like your tool. So I had a look and it might work for us. I don't really know at the moment because I'm not sure.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  So not all of our front of house team have fixed contracts. A lot of them are casual zero hour staff because they do other things. So like I say, some of them aren't in for maybe a week or two before they come back. And so I'm not sure if that fits with your tool or if it's more designed for people, you know, like person a works Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and then someone else works Monday, Wednesday, Friday, like kind of regular people fixed pattern kind of thing. So I'm just intrigued that's really that's it just to see if it might make life better for us.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. I think so. If I understand this correctly, like people are working on some days and then they are not, there is no fixed pattern in terms of who is available on which day. But, okay… how many people do we have in this team in total? The receptions team?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  I think… six… so well, five plus five plus me because I sort of I'm overseeing like overseeing it all. So, so six, maybe there might be another set, not more than 10 but sort of somewhere between five and 10.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. And I'm assuming that today, everybody's logging into the same outlook account, and then that's how they're picking up the emails, right?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  No, they all, we use windows. So it's all like office three six five logged into edge when they log in. So they log in on their personal accounts and then open the group mailbox via like open another mailbox and open it that way. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  They open it in another window, right? Another tab in a different tab. They have two tabs open two outlook, open. One is their own personal, and the other one is the group?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Yes, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. I mean, you can definitely tackle this with hiver, you know, having said that the pattern that you're mentioning which is like some people are available, some people are not, that will not really change anything within hiver, but actually it can work in your favor because if someone is not available, at least as a team, we are aware in terms of, you know, what open emails do we have today that we need to take care of in the absence of someone else? So that there is no more confusion between emails are not getting missed. And we know as you know, who is actually responsible for closing it at a time. So we can definitely see that, allow me to share my screen, Katie, and then we can actually go through this together. Understand what the tool is capable of and how that aligns with what you're looking to solve, right? Let me just share my screen. Let me know if you can see it.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Yeah, go ahead. Perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Great. So just a quick introduction, Katie, hiver is an AI powered customer service tool that extends to different departments in a company as long as you have a generic email address that you need to tackle as a team. So in order to get started, you log into this URL, which is app, hiverhq. Com. This is where you're able to manage this inbox within hiver. We have a mobile application as well. So through mobile as well. You can sort of, you know, tackle this within your phones. Now, in order to get started, you will be logging into your respective outlook. So you'll be using your outlook credentials. I'm just assuming that everybody has their own workspace accounts. Yes, yeah, they do. Yeah, perfect. Perfect. So they'll be just using that to log in here at all times. We can also see team availability. You can mark yourself available and not available as per when you're working. So this will help a lot especially in your use case wherein people are not always available at all times. So only when you've marked yourself available, will you be receiving any emails, any new emails or any reply that comes on the same thread wherein you were previously working on. So this will help a lot in terms of tracking the availability of the team. And from here, on the left side, I have two inboxes for myself. One is my personal inbox. So hiver allows you to connect your personal inbox as well so that you don't have to sort of hop between outlook and hiver. If you would like. You can actually manage your individual inbox within here itself. And then of course, you would have your shared inbox. So today, I'm part of five of such shared inboxes in my company, pertaining to different departments. In your case, we'll start with one as of now, which is your info inbox. We will connect it and we will add all the relevant team members here so that everybody now can manage it within hiver itself. This looks a lot like if you have a shared inbox in outlook already, this will look a lot similar to that in terms of the setup takes about like 10 minutes to get this configured. Once this is done now, we do not have to tackle or manage this inbox from our outlook. We would rather do this from hiver in terms of the workflow and how this is going to look like you would have these sections here that will define your day to day workflow. And we will make sure that nothing slips through the crack. Of course, we can automate certain workflows as well. For example, if there is a specific person. Responsible for a specific kind of emails. We can directly just create that automation and make sure that those get auto assigned to that specific person. For now, I have four such emails which are unattended which have just hit the inbox. And these are unassigned currently, which means that nobody has started working on these. As I click on any email here, you would have this activity panel on the right side which will help you sort of navigate with your day to day workflow wherein you can do a couple of things. Number one, we can give the ownership to the email as to who needs to work on this. So you will see everybody's name and faces. You can see whether they're available or not. So I can see Cole is not available right now. So I would not assign this to him. Rather, I'll just assign this to myself for now. And once I do this, you will notice this activity gets logged in real time. So this is where you would have or everybody can see the real time logs so that to understand what exactly happened on each email. And as you give the ownership here, that email now will move to their person's, mind section here, right? And this is where I know these are the five emails that I am responsible for and I need to work on. There is no longer any confusion as to should I pick this up? Is someone else already working on it? And things like that. Now, there is a crucial point that you mentioned, this is the section where I'm seeing my own emails, right? How do we have the visibility on everybody's workflow? This is where you go into the team section here. This is going to be a central hub for everyone's visibility. We can see currently we have in total 38 open emails as a team and this is how these are distributed right now. How this is going to be helpful to you specifically is since you have team members not always available. So, for example, Cole is now not available, right? Either he can move all the open emails to someone else in the team who can take it up or as a team member or his colleague or a team manager or a supervisor, I can just go and assign this to the next person available. So that if any reply comes on these instead of going getting those replies going into the unassigned section, we already have given someone the responsibility to tackle those responses here, right? So does this make sense? So let me know if I'm going too fast. No, no, it makes sense. OK. So this is how you can actually, you know, tackle… this specific thing wherein we can actually be more flexible in terms of assigning. Emails between each other and making sure that we are not slipping through the crack and also not getting into duplicate efforts. So that we have one owner assigned at a time to each email, right? And from here, one more thing since we are in the collaborative section here, we can also exchange notes within hiver itself. So, for example, let me pull an email from Matthew here that he's working on. Let's go to the last one. And I see this email is something wherein I need to inform him something about. So what I'll do is I'll just add a quick note. I will add mention him and I can just write my message within here itself so that Matthew will receive a notification in this note in this bell icon and you'll see. Okay, Yukta has mentioned me somewhere. He'll click on it, come on the same email and we both actually can converse in regards to this ongoing email. So this is where we are able to collaborate without having to mark each other in CC or forward emails. Yeah. Right now, coming back to the individual workflow as an email gets assigned to me, you would also notice we have certain tags assigned to certain emails. Like this one is called VIP customer account review onboarding champion identified. Multiple tags are applied here. And this is really helpful in terms of me understanding what this email is about without even having to read through this, right? And these are the tags that you can create for your own workflow specifically given that you mentioned, you are receiving a lot of generic emails in this inbox, right? So in order to categorize them for our own understanding and cleanliness, we can create different tags and assign tags as per where it belongs, so that for our own visibility, it's a lot easier to get to that email. This can be updated as well through AI. So with the AI tagging, we can just apply tags manually for a couple of instances. For example, I apply the tag manually for 10 times and from the eleventh time onwards, AI will learn that behavior as to what kind of emails you're applying this tag to. And it's going to start applying those tags for you here. Now, from here, I'll just go ahead and respond to this email. Now in order to respond, I can use certain templates. Do you guys use any templates currently? Do you have any standard responses to emails?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Yes, sort of, but they're just like saved in draft. So they'll go and grab it and copy and paste it into the reply that they're using. So yeah, not lots, but just, and of course, everyone has a different, like when emails are forwarded to me from that mailbox, I can work out who they're from just from the tone of what's been written in them, whether they've put their name on them or not. So everyone has their own style, but there's one or two situations where there are templates written out that get used got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It got it. Yeah, I mean if there are any standard responses, if you want to standardize the way we are responding to these emails on a day to day basis to fasten this process. Actually you can use hiver template repository as well. So this is where you can put all the templates that you think are relevant for you and you can just create different folders as well. So to identify it better. And you just pull the relevant template from there and you can still make the edits. You don't have to sort of just copy paste it. You just get some template here, edit it if you want use AI to sort of better it for you and then you just hit send and this is done. So this is how you can send the responses or you can also use AI here in order to help you drafting those responses, right? So you can train AI and make it as your personal assistant, wherein it will get trained on your company resources, whatever data that you can, you know, feed into it in terms of any documents, PDF, anything of that sort, AI is going to learn all that knowledge and based on that can help you drafting the responses or you can ask any question that will help you sort of be able to respond to these emails a lot faster. Yeah. Right. And from here, I think I'll just go ahead and change the status. Now, this is what we are going to rely on and not on read and unread functionality of outlook. We will be tracking the progress from these three starters which is open pending and closed. As long as we have emails sitting in these three sections. On top, these are all open emails that we are working on. Once I work on it, I will either mark this as pending if I'm still expecting a response from the other side or I can just simply close this if there is nothing else pending to be done. And once I do that, you will notice now, I'm left with nine emails to work on and all the closed ones you will find in the all views section here that will contain all the closed one that your team has already worked on or you can find pending here. And if in case you get any response on either of these, they will come back into the mind section of that person so that they can just pick it up. Yep. That's good. So this is the basic workflow Katie as to how it's going to look like any feedback thoughts, anything that I might have missed that you would be interested in exploring?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  No, I just want to, in terms of the like the… AI templates and stuff, are you able to automate certain responses? So… like if someone wants to cancel their booking or the class that they're in, like automate a response, that would then go and say, you know, we'd really appreciate your feedback as to why here's a form to fill in. So that those emails are particularly helpful. Like, is that something that you'd have to, you know, get through 10 emails and train the AI for before it would do it itself? Or could you predefine that in advance because that's definitely something we would be interested in?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's a great question for sure. There are two ways to go about it if you want to completely automate this process because with AI, AI is not going to do anything on your behalf until you prompt something to it, right? So that's how it's going to work for you when a cancellation request comes. And if it's a standard response that you would want to send, rather, you can use template and put that template in hiver. So that when you're responding to that email, you just choose that template which is called, we just search for it as cancellation. Then the response, this is one way of doing it. I don't think we need AI for that or we can just automate this entire process by going into the admin panel. I'll just show you. Let's say we go into the sales inbox here and go into the automations. This is where you do all your magic in terms of the backend stuff, what automations you would like to do. So, let's say we create this automation for all the cancellation requests, we can name this. And we say whenever an email comes in which fulfills this condition, which is let's say in the subject, we have certain keywords, cancel cancellation or you can just put more if you like. And you also take in the body just to be more sure whenever we get these keywords, what we can do is we can just send a reply from here itself.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  So we can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Just do this and just type… this whatever standard response that you would like to give. So you can save this. Now, whenever an email comes in with these keywords, this email is going to get auto triggered. And from there, if you would like to assign this to a specific person in the team to take care of it, then you can do that or if you think that after this, there is nothing else for us to do, you can just update the status and just mark it as closed. Yeah. Okay. You can do different things here. Is this what you were asking or something else?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Yeah, no, that's perfect. That's something that obviously outlook at the moment. We could do it with power automate, but there's not really anyone with enough knowledge of that to build it itself. So that's definitely something that we are looking into. So, yeah, that would be really helpful. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We can definitely achieve this. And of course, within the outlook with their shared inbox, like the major, the majority of limitations that we hear in terms of the automation and also how, you know, it's difficult to track in terms of who is actually the owner of any email at a time. Looking into the analytics. Is analytics also part of your key metrics here? Yeah?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  No, we don't really, we don't really look at analytics at the moment just because it's all, I'll be honest, it's very badly managed. So that would be something that's, quite interesting if we can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, if.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  it is for us, if it's something we can get our heads around then yeah, it would be. And obviously, you know, these numbers would, excuse me, these numbers here would be skewed based on the staff members that are working the most. So, yeah, that's but no, that's… really interesting.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So like I'm just curious like from five people that you have, how do they work?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Like is, and, how does it really place? I mean, how is it placed currently? Is anyone work like at any time that they're available? Are these like part time employees that you have, or how?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  So, we have one person on a full time contract, two who are on part time contracts and then the others are casual contracts. So zero hours with us. So like they're employees, but there's no guaranteed work. It's and so as I say, they do other things. So it fits around what they do, our reception, our building is open Monday to Friday, nine till nine and then Saturdays like nine till about three or four sometimes into the evenings on Saturday, sometimes open on Sundays. So, yeah, you know, six days a week, there's someone, but I would say that maybe four days or four mornings, it might be the same person. And then the rest of it is just like on a rota basis, you know, how it, you know, how it is. But aside from that sort of full time employee who also like does the rotaring for the team and deals with some of the other stuff in the venue.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  So, isn't always on the desk there's not… like there isn't really a regular pattern because, it's all varying depending on what, you know, what week of the year it is basically. And then, you know, you get people that are on holiday and all. And all this adds up. And so, yeah, so stuff just gets missed and it's a bit chaotic. We want to make it better. So, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I think for this having a clear ownership assigned to each person could help for sure and then followed by a tags to actually categorize your email so that you know what email is about and how it's actually placed and how we are distributing those based on the categorization that we have done. I think these two could be the major thing for you as you get started in order to better manage this inbox. And then with the availability and with the visibility in terms of who is actually working on, what if I come on Wednesday, let's say Wednesday morning and look at the inbox. I can easily see what are the emails that are still assigned to me that I need to work on. And also just check the team inbox, see what other people have that have in their radar. And if there is anything that I need to pick up. So that when I pick this up and I assign this to myself next day, the other person will not be confused because I've already done the job here and they can clearly see as to, you know, okay, Yukta assigned it to herself. She only managed this and this is where now I can pick it up, right? So it'd be a lot easier for people to get some background as to what happened in the history while they were not present. And so, to make sure that, you know, we are not… duplicating efforts to begin with. And also make sure that nothing is slipping or pending from our side.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Yeah, definitely. And… if it, no… that's okay. I don't know where I'm going with that question. If it comes back to me, I will ask you another time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's completely fine. As a next step, I would suggest that if you would like to do the trial, we do have a seven day trial that we offer, and I think you guys are a charity based organization, right? I was just looking up.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Yeah, we are a charity. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, we do have special pricing, for, you know, your kind of your kind organization. So I think from the pricing perspective, we could also sort of get you the right price. Do you have any budget? Anything already aside for this project?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Not a massive amount but we can, you know, if it makes work, if it makes work, you know, more efficient, then we can definitely try and find something. But at the moment I've just… as I say, I was talking to someone, they mentioned your platform and I was like, right? Okay, I need to look into this a bit more and just see how we might be able to make it work for us. So… yeah, as I say, if… I think maybe the seven day trial is probably, a good thing to go. We are gonna, we've got a management meeting next week, so I want to present it to the rest of the like the management, the senior management team as a like this could be a possible solution if that's okay with you. And then I can get back to you, after that and sort of say where it's gone, it might be that budget is the thing, that does kick us down. But definitely, I can see well, our CEO absolutely. I can see him going for this, as a solution because it does everything that we are not right now. So, so yeah. So I will thank you for your time. It's, really great, really interesting to see. And I'll get back to you once we've had that meeting next week.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let's do that. And I think after the feedback, we'll be in a better position to actually see what could be the potential next steps if we would like to do the trial. I'm happy to run you through that as well in terms of the pricing. Just make sure that we are pretty flexible. So I think growth plan is something that I can recommend given or understanding your key requirements. So this is the plan that we'll be looking at in case you need to present this to your management and we.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  have a pretty.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  percent flat off for the ngos and charity organization. So you will get that and over and above, we can always discuss your budget once you have it, and then accordingly, we can take a call from there. Oh.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Thank you. Appreciate it. Great. Okay. I will, I've got some notes. I've got your website as well so I can share that. And yeah, I will. Yeah, I'll get back to you in a week or so once we've had our meeting next week?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Is it possible Katie to have a placeholder anytime for next week or after that?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Yeah, let's say next week is looking a bit bonkers. Monday then the ninth of February. So, the Monday of the week after?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Possibly… 12, I could do midday, my time. I'm not sure I can't do the maths to work out what it is your time?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'm based in India. So currently, it's three 30 for me.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Okay. So, it's just, it's almost 10 o'clock here. So, two hours on from now, would that be all right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 12 P. M, right. Your time?

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  12 P. M? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That works for me. That'll be five 30 P. M. So I think that works perfectly great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So we can meet on Monday. And before that, if you have any questions, just feel free to reach out to me and I can answer that for you.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Brilliant. Thank you so much. I really appreciate your time and have a good rest of your day.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You too. Thank you. Bye bye.

Katie Snell (katie.snell@thegarage.org.uk):
  Thank you. Bye bye bye.
