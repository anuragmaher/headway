Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Lizzie. How are you doing?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Hi there. All good. Thank you. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm good. Thanks for checking in… just a sec. Sorry, I just had my audio and my computer wants to restart. Sorry, there's a lot happening on my device. Really don't.

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  worry at all. Not a problem.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All good, Lizzie. Thanks so much for joining today's. Call, quick introductions. I'm Raghav, I'm going to be your account manager, point of contact for right now. Been with the business for about eight years, excited with all the new AI features we're launching and realized that you also booked today's, call to chat about the AI features, right? So, before I, you know, sort of… hello?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hello?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Sorry, no, it's definitely worth doing. Makes things a bit easier. Doesn't it after a meeting?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Looks like my laptop decided to restart much against my choice, but can you hear me clearly now?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Yes, absolutely.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's sick. I think I'll have to get myself out. I'm sorry?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Should be better now should be better now.

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Yeah, all good all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Perfect. All right, Lizzie. So, yeah, I was just going to ask before we start talking about the features, the capabilities and everything. Have you had a chance to explore the AI features on hiver and what's your initial reactions and take on that?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  I actually haven't managed to have a go with it yet. So, my colleague, Bianca, so we obviously we've been using hiver now for close to a year. I think I'm not super sure for how long. I think one of my colleagues has been using a little bit maybe, but I'm so I, within the company I work with systems, my colleague who works with customer care is using hiver more on a day to day experience. And one of the things, one of the goals that I want to achieve this month is working on a framework to get a chat and AI bot handling some of our more simple inquiries, maybe not the complex ones but definitely ones where, you know, someone's asking about the status of their order. It would be really great if, yeah, if I could just learn a little bit more through you about how it's going at the moment with that AI bot.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. Definitely. So when it comes to the AI bot, we've actually already got like a hiver chat widget and a whole chat flow that we've created. This is a feature that you can access as of today. And, with the context of that feature being AI enabled, our initial step right now is to have that sort of surface knowledge base articles and help articles that you've got on hiver within the chat window itself. AI based chat or AI enabled chat is something that's on our roadmap for this quarter and all of next year as well. So if you could maybe give me, some insight, what kind of AI you're looking at when it comes to AI chatbots, that'll put me at a better place to talk to you a little bit about it. And once my laptop's up and running, hopefully show you something as well?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Honestly, don't worry. It's fine. So, yeah. So I guess something that, you know, we would be interested in is if we had an faq set up, is the chatbot? Is it, how would it kind of, I guess I'd be interested to know if someone got in touch and basically said I was expecting my order this week. Can it, when is it due to arrive? If that is too complex for the AI at the moment? Then things like I've got a I'd really like to know some more information on this product or where can I find images of this product? So I can list on my own website because we're a wholesaler. I think simple inquiries like that would be really interested to know just how to start setting up the framework so that we can get some response, get some responses, auto responses set up. And that way then, you know, it can say things on. I think something that we're interested in doing is, you know, being very clear to our customers, if you'd like to speak to a human, you can. But here's our AI bots answer to your inquiry. So it's just those simple, yeah, how do I find photos for my listings? Do you have the barcode information for this product? Things that just the team spends five to 10 minutes getting all of that documentation together. Whereas we'd really like to like streamline that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, definitely. So two parts to your question. The first part is what you're looking for in terms of getting this data across your data sources, right? When it comes to like process documents, the usual kind of checks and things like, that needs to be included when it comes to answering a response like this, that's possible as of today through hiver's co pilot that's available on emails, right? So this is something that you can do on email. So, my, the second half of my question is perspective, this does look like something that would be on our roadmap and needs to be picked up at a point in the future. So I'll have to check on what the exact release date for those looks like. So, could I ask you, are you interested in this purely from a chat first perspective or is this more like, can the chatbot grow into something like this? And I still need this for email handling as well?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Yeah, I think it's about growing and I think, yeah. So I think for chatbox, like we talked about it like, we really do want a chatbox, we want one integrated on our Shopify, we want whatsapp messages. We just want to make it as easy as possible for customers to respond. And because we're a small team, AI makes so much sense. But, yeah, the co pilot working for simple emails is definitely something I'll look into probably this afternoon. But yeah, that, I mean it's inevitable isn't it that AI is going to come in and be handling all this communication completely one day. So, yeah, we want to make sure that we're not two years behind where we need to be in like in two years.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, no, that makes total sense. So, from a future proofing perspective, let me first chat with my team in terms of timelines, the exact or at least the tentative quarters or months in which we're planning these releases. And I think that would be best. But instead of me just giving you a date and time right now and then, you know, having to go back on that later. So, for the chat first approach, let me talk to my team in detail, understand what our release roadmap looks like and based on that, should be able to give you as much clarity as we have in terms of timelines in terms of what that looks like, what the stages would potentially look like as well, as for the co pilot, now, because that's something that you already have access to. And when you say, did you want to like check it out, a couple of suggestions, right? And if you can share your screen, I can maybe give you some pointers on how to get co pilot up.

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Yeah, sure. One second… shall I unbox with you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  There we go. Yay.

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  So if I go into, would it be under hiver settings?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, admin panel for sure. Brilliant. Can you click on hiver AI on the left side?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Oh, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Brilliant. Okay. So there's actually three perspectives of, or rather three features that we've bundled into two major categories on the AI front. Co pilot is the one that I brought you here to talk about. Could you just enable it for right now? So I can run through the demo? Yeah, perfect. Now, can you click on knowledge source? Yep. All right. Brilliant. So this is the first part of it, which is training the co pilot or the ask AI to be able to generate these responses, answer queries, and you can use it conversationally to an extent where it's kind of like talking to gemini or chat gpt, but it's more contextual and it's more specific as opposed to being generic, one size fits all. So, first step to start having the co pilot enabled is basically to upload documents, snippets in terms of any small bits of information, past emails, things like that you feel would be useful. And essentially, once you have that ready, right? So that's going to be step one, make sure you come here, upload a few documents, so you can run some tests. And then, you know, once you've done that because you click on Gmail, and I'll show you what that experience looks like. Now that you've got it enabled.

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Okay. So, do I just click on Gmail now?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Go back to Gmail. Yeah. And over… here, can you open any email that's part of a mailbox? Just? Anything is fine. Can you open that as well? And do you see that little spark like in, on the bottom right above view, Shopify details… this one here?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I have a cab in the way.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. So this is the co pilot interactive space or the ask AI interactive space. So as an agent in your team, if I will receive an email and I want to find out, hey, what's the process here? How do you get there? It's like you said, right? How does somebody upload images? What's the process to get them barcodes? How do they go about doing it? So as long as any or all of these knowledge sources as we call it is uploaded to hiver's, AI. Then as an agent, I can just go in here and just click on drop to reply. As simple as that, instead of just generating responses, it's going to give me scenarios. And as an agent, I have control saying, okay, I want to ask it for this specific scenario. So now I can just try to call the alarm and hit enter and you'll just see what a typical sort of approach here would look like, right? So what it would do is basically run through the knowledge sources you've uploaded if you're building out an entire knowledge base or an faq based on hiver, that just makes things all the more easier for the integration, right? And it can do, you know, run through links within your knowledge, right? So you don't necessarily have to think about creating a very exhaustive one. You can just include whatever is really relevant there and then put like, hey here's a website link that has more details, something along those lines. So the ask AI would effectively run through all of that, include that in its findings. And as a result, give the agent a response like this. Or if you click on insert, that then becomes a draft that the agent can further edit and send it out further edit and send it out like that's about it. And we've already launched. So this top and the bottom part with the lines and everything that's going to be removed over the next two or three days. We're just waiting on Chrome to get the extension update rolled out so that one's already done, which means in a real world scenario, this is basically going to be flying in the draft modify change if you want to one click and you can send it out right now. If you want to like let's say, click on the three dots on the top right next to the X. Yeah, that one click on clear chat… yeah, and just clear it. Yeah. And this is what I meant by, you can keep it a little conversational. So let's say, first off, so far the agent was asking about process one, the customer has two questions. Then you can just clear the chat and be like all right. Now, give me details for process two or question two, and it can give you that sort of distinction if it's very granular processes. If it's more generally taking information drafting it as a ready to go email and then having it ready, that's going to be good to go. Another advantage with this ask AI is if you click on summarize it's, actually going to give you a lot more in terms of intel, what's happened on that email so far? Who's handled it? What's been suggested? And again, based on your process documents being there, it should be able to give you more detailed next steps as well. So again, if this requires your team to pass it on to a different team, internal stakeholders, things like that, as long as that data is on hiver, that's going to show up here as well. So that's the, yeah, that's the general route which we're taking for the ask AI. But quite a lot of our customers who've got this enabled and trained in the last three months have found it really useful. So I'm confident in that, you know, this would be pretty useful in an everyday perspective. But like I said, this is more email for ready to go today kind of angle, right?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Will there be as part of the roadmap? Do you think, AI looking through all paths, for example, communication for similar situations so that you don't just have to upload snippets, will it also be looking at all data across all time through all emails?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I do foresee that being the natural transition in which we're heading as we build and refine the AI model. As of right now, we've consciously decided to let the teams on hiver train the AI model with the documents and everything just so that we make it more contextually aware heading into the discussion, right? So that's the reason we want you to add the documents and everything right now. But yeah, definitely down the line, there will be places where as you handle emails, you can probably flag it as a source to your co pilot or ask AI because you don't have an faq for it, but it's a very specific scenario comes again, you want everybody to know what's happening, right? So we are thinking along those lines and we're developing down that route as well. Cool. Yeah. Now, the extension of ask AI and this is a feature planned for Q4 is that we're going to be launching something called AI tasks as well, AI tasks as well. If you notice right now, the next steps is just a bullet point giving the agent information on what to do, right? So the way we're ideating on this is that AI tasks would effectively be able to not just tell the team on hiver what to do but actually be able to create stuff for them. So if it's for instance, sending out an email to support from here, the AI task would be able to mark a task saying, send email to support and have that associated to an agent. The whole shebang there, right? Fully built out. That's what we'd expect it to do along with tying into automations and giving your workflow recommendations saying, hey, your team member's been doing this pretty frequently. We think a workflow like this would help. Do you think that's going to be useful?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Yeah, for sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's the way we're looking at it. That's the way we're looking at it, what we're also building. And this is something that you'll have access to from the eighteenth of November. Friday, this week is going to be a feature called smart qe, effectively a way for you as a team lead and every team lead effectively to track the responses that your teams are sending out based on factors like grammar competitiveness, the completeness of it, which is the relevant information has been included, all of those bits as well. And that's about 90 percent ready just waiting on final checks. And that should be out on the eighteenth of November so that you can continue testing that out and exploring that as well to see if it helps right? Outside of this, ask AI. There's also AI tagging where based on the tags, I'm guessing you're probably just running automations to add the categories. If that's possible right now. That's more deterministic. I'm sure you've seen the scope for things falling through the cracks as well. So with AI tagging again, first step, you have control on how you want to train it. But essentially, what we can do is use any of your existing tags or create new tags and use that train the AI with 10 examples manually fed examples where you add the tag manually and train the AI saying, hey here's the breadth and the scope of the term refund for the B to B inbox. So once you give it that training AI is then going to be able to pick up, which means literally from the eleventh email onwards, AI will just apply the tag and you don't necessarily need an automation rule just to apply a tag anymore, more broader wider scope and definitely all encapsulating as much as possible that's automatically categorized benefit of doing that is now your workflows, don't need to start at adding a tag. They can just start with, hey, if this tag is there, like if the refund tag, is there, notify billing inform, Lizzie, send an email to the customer saying, hey here's, billing's contact details, things like that. So now you can look at your automations with a bit more granular depth as opposed to step one. In terms of just adding the tag, right? We've also got sentiments and I think that might be useful more from a sense of understanding the emotion of the emails as they come into your inbox. So it's going to have a three or five point scale. You can choose from three means positive, neutral, negative. Five is very, positive. Neutral, negative, very negative. Basically, right? And even there you get to tweak the prompts that we've got there system defaults, you can tweak it. So it starts aligning more to what you as a business identify as a negative or a very negative sentiment and effectively do two things. One again tied back to automation. So if something's negative or very negative, you get a response out to the customer, you get an email from the manager going out saying, hey, I'm the leader notice you've got this. We want to make sure we set it right by, you go at it from there. On the other hand, if it's positive or very positive, some of our E commerce customers have started sending out review links saying, hey here's, our Google store here's, our play store review whatever, right? Just go there, drop a good note. We love that you're having a good experience. What you can also track. Yeah. What you can also track with the sentiments is that it's not a one time thing. So it becomes more of an ongoing measure, which means the customer comes in with a negative mindset or a negative tonality on the email. And then after two emails, Raghav turns them to a positive emotion or a positive reaction. At the end of it, you're going to be able to track that journey as well. You're going to be able to see all right, Raghav has basically turned five negative customers into positive customers or negative interactions to positive interactions, right? Positive interactions, right? So that again will flow into your reporting and should give you a better understanding of the work, customer journey as we call it here, customer journey as we call it here. So among the features that I've mentioned so far ask, AI is already there. AI tagging and AI static as well are already active. You can enable them test them out and see what they feel like. I'm going to be your primary point of contact. So any specific pointers you notice where you're like, hey, if this could work just a little bit differently, it'll help us feel free to keep that feedback flowing. And we can keep comms open on that front. And lastly on the QA piece, what I can do is send you after our call, just send you a bunch of help articles that detail all of these features that I mentioned. I think we might have a couple of help articles or some kind of prototype or click through video that I can send for the upcoming features. So that way you have as much information as you need in one space heading into the AI conversation and, you know, if it makes sense. We can look at the commercial angle of it because the whole AI piece, the entire suite of it is a 20 dollar per user per month paid add on. Yeah. So, yeah, that's the AI overview or AI vision as it stands for hiver as of today. Do you think this would be useful as we continue discussing more about it?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Yeah, definitely. I think all of the features you've talked about today, I'd be super interested in trying out and I'll spend a bit of time. Yeah, and I'll probably have a few questions I'm sure I'll send across. I'll share the documents as well with the team as well, so we can all have a go with it and just give feedback and then, yeah, hopefully we can just roll it into our, yeah, into our monthly plan.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. Anything else for me for today? At least?

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  No, not at all. We're really enjoying using hiver. So I think this is just another positive really.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. It's great hearing that. So, yeah. So look for my email over the next couple of hours with the details, documentation and everything. Give me a bit in terms of understanding our roadmap and the way that falls in terms of the chatbot and the chat first approach. So that way, you know, I can keep you posted as that happens, what that looks like as well. And I mean, what I do is basically reach out back to you in like a, week and a half from now, once you've had some time to test the tagging, the copilot or the ask AI and the sentiment and, you know, if it makes sense, I'm sure we're going to have a little bit of incentives running at the end of the month with thanksgiving and everything. So, if you're you know, if you're good by then and if you've had some time testing things out and you're ready to move ahead, I'm sure I can make a small discount easier on the cost angle as well. Yeah.

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  Brilliant. Fantastic. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. Then. Thank you so much for your time on the call again. I apologize for the snafu with the laptop next time. I'll be better prepared, but on that note, look for my email for everything else Lizzie.

Lizzie (lizzie@pikkii.com):
  No worries at all. Thank you so much for your time and yeah, have a great day and speak soon.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Speak soon. Bye.
