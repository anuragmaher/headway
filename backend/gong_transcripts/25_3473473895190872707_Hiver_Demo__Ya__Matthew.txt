================================================================================

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, how you doing?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Good. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Doing well, doing well. Appreciate you taking the time here. Looks like Jack is joining too. Yep. Hello? Hey, Jack. How you doing?

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  I'm doing great. Nice to meet you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, nice to meet. You. Appreciate you both joining here. I saw there was a third person on the invite. I don't think she's going to be able to make it. I got a decline. So I think we're all here.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  Yes, sir.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, my name is matt senior account executive here at hiver agenda for the call today. Wanted to spend the first couple of minutes or so.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Just getting an understanding of what you're looking for, helping you determine if hiver can fit your needs. And then if so, we can go ahead and walk through the product and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yep. Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, if one of you want to start here, tell me a little bit about kind of what motivated you to book this call?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yeah. So right now, we're getting about like 100 emails a day coming through our accounts receivable inbox, where we manage our billing and payments inquiries coming from customers and about half of those that don't need a response. So we're looking for like a software can help us to manage our inbox better, that can kind of fill out those emails that don't need a response. And those emails includes like remittances from customers and then those auto replies from customers as well. And also maybe if the tool can help us to prioritize those emails that are coming from customers… and maybe also can like help us draft emails for those like easy inquiries that's coming through, for example, like we have customers requesting for like a W9, if a tool can help like to draft an email to provide, you know, the W9. Yeah, I think that's basically, it does anything Jack.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  No, I think that pretty much summarizes it. Yeah, we're doing things kind of the old fashioned way on this Ar, team where we're just doing, you know, responding to emails through like a Gmail delegated access. And so we're just really exploring like Ar, inbox automation, whatever tools might help kind of organize and make our processes a little more scalable.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, absolutely. We help a lot of accounts receivable teams with just this and you guys are using Gmail as well, right? Yep. Awesome. And then do you guys use Netsuite by chance?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  We are, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. Perfect. Yep. So, yep, you got about 400 emails a day coming into this email. So one accounts receivable email that you have.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  It's 100 emails on average of 100 email a day.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. Average. Yeah. Oh, okay. Got it. And the… accounts receivable email. Is it one shared address like Ar at? Okay. And then how many people on your team manage these emails?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Right now, just mainly me, but maybe in the future, probably three.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then you're the senior accounting analyst there, right?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yes, senior accounts receivable analyst, yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Accounts receivable, and then Jack, what's your role?

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  Accounts receivable manager?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Yeah, hiver can do all these things for you. So help you filter out that one. We'll have to work on a bit, but help you filter out some of these emails that don't need a response. It can help you write emails. We have a Netsuite integration as well. And it can also help you draft emails too. So, yeah, definitely. We work, like I was saying, we work with a lot of accounts payable receivable teams looking to better manage their inbox track emails, W, nine taxes, all those things. So, essentially, what hiver can do is hiver can turn your email into a finance help desk for you. So I went ahead and shared my screen here. Can you see it? Yes. Awesome. And you haven't started a trial yet, have you, I don't think I saw it.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Not yet.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. So a little bit, just a little bit about hiver, we're a email management help desk platform. We have over 200 employees. We have over 2000 customers ranging from small businesses to some of the largest companies in the world, companies such as openai, companies such as capital one. So it is very scalable as well. And we're a certified Google partner. So all you do is you download the hiver extension. Once you download the extension, you're going to have these yellow icons up here in the right? And then these yellow icons down here. And you're going to see this folder here called finance for you. We could just call it accounts receivable, call it whatever you want. And it's tied to that shared email address that you have, right? So yours would be accounts receivable. And then that Ar email that you have is tied to that folder. So what's going to happen is you're going to have your personal emails up here just like normal. Except now you're going to have that quick access to that accounts receivable email down here. And then also you can share this folder with other people on your team so that they can also see into this folder as well. And then what happens is anytime somebody emails that Ar, email, it's going to start in the unassigned folder. So it hasn't been assigned to anyone. This is where these emails start. And when you open these emails, you're now going to have this hiver panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can assign it to each other, right? To see, you know, who's accountable for this. We have statuses open pending and closed. So, you know, if these emails need any further action, we also have tags. So these will help you categorize these emails. These are completely customizable. And when it comes to the tags and the assigning, we could set up automations for these, and we could do it based on keywords, for example. So if you handle all the invoices and taxes, emails, we can set up automations that says any email that comes in that mentions the word invoice, mentions the word taxes automatically gets assigned to you and then automatically gets the tax tag added to it.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  So if there's a remittance that come in, it can be auto tagged as remittance. And then it will be moved to the remittance folder.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So are the remittance emails, the emails that don't require any action from anyone, right? Right. Okay. So for those, yeah, we could set up an automation if it says the word remittance in the subject or the body of the email, then actually, instead of assigning it to people, we can add the remittance tag, which would then can move it to a remittance folder and we can have it automatically move to the closed status.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Got it. So what if it's sometimes when customers send in a remittance, there's no text. It's just an attachment, but there might be the word remittance on the attachment. Would it be recognized as a remittance?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, no, not at all. Like.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Text on the email, okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Text in the subject or the body of the email that's how it works. Now, we could also do it by domains. Does it come from the same domain every time or no?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  I'm not sure. Some of them may not be, yeah.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  For example, some of them too, I noticed come from like a no reply at wherever. Com. So, would we be able to set up a rule in the system that says, hey, anything that comes from a no reply email? We just automatically archive or assign it as a closed status?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So if there's a certain domain that is sending you a lot of these emails, then, yes, we could set up an automation where basically… we could do just that. So the automations are here. So how the automations work? I mean, there's a lot of things they could do. But just in this case, if a new email is received and… the, from email or the from domain… if the from email is, you know?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Is that email? I know yours is going to be remittance? Basically like if you get, if you're getting a lot of those emails from that email, you can say, then we want it to automatically.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Change it to closed. Yeah. And then we want it to automatically add the tag that you have created. So basically, anytime this email comes in, it's going to automatically get closed, which would immediately take it out of that folder. So that you would know that you don't have to take any action and it would automatically go into a, get tagged as well. So you could do it with domains, like I was saying. And then also, we could do it with, keywords.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And things like that. So, so yeah, we could, so this is how you would do it. So, basically, you can set up a lot of conditions for these emails coming in and you could set up multiple automations too. It doesn't have to all be in one automation. And then that way it'll automatically get tagged into that other section and it will automatically get closed so that it'll hiver will recognize that you don't have to take any action on it.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  Does, do you guys use AI to sort of like, work through the automations or like read and analyze emails?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So this automation for this particular scenario, is, is not leveraging the AI, but yeah, that's also something that we could do as well. So we have something called AI extract?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Where you can actually extract data from the email as well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, in this example, it can extract things like ids, certain information, from the email. And then based on that, it can take action. But, yeah, let me ask my team actually cause maybe that maybe, the extract could work for recognizing these remittance emails as well. And then it could automatically close them out.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  Yeah, I'm wondering too, like do you, is there automations in place to draft responses, for us that we can then approve and send? For example, a common request is, hey, can we get a copy of your W9 or, hey, can we get a copy of your payment instructions? Can we set up the system to recognize that kind of question? And then just auto, draft the response. We could just approve that and send it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me talk to my team here. This, this part's fairly new for us. We have various AI features. This being part of the automations is fairly new for us. So, let me ask my team here and get back to you. I believe it could because… a part of these automations too is you could set up auto replies?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, it could be like, yeah.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  So, we could set up some templates to say, like here's our W9 auto reply here's, our payment instruction, auto reply here's. What about you mentioned like there's an integration with Netsuite. I like to hear how that works. And for example, could we set up an automation where if someone asks for a copy of their invoice, we can automatically draft a response where we're attaching that invoice from Netsuite?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So let me go over here real quick.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Wow. So a couple things here. First of all, we had email templates that you can, you know, just share with everyone. So there, there's also that… let me choose one without the placeholders there. So we have email templates that can be shared across the team. We also have an AI chat gpt which can, you know, fix the grammar, improve the writing, et cetera. But the reason I'm showing you this too is because I want to show you this right here. So we do have an AI co pilot… which can actually draft replies for you. It learns from the emails that you've been getting. It can also reference documents… a knowledge base et cetera, to provide contextual answers too. It's going to ask a three prompt question. You choose which prompts you want.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then it will go ahead and reply back to you. So it learns from the emails that you're getting. And then also, it can reference the, it can reference a knowledge base or different documents that you want to upload.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. And then, yeah.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  And sorry, can you talk a little more about the Netsuite integration?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. I just want to show you this because this part is really the part that can draft replies for you. At this time. It's based on this co pilot here. I'm going to have to sync with my team here as far as the different automations that we could do for you. But yeah, I'll get back to you on that part as well as far as the Netsuite integration goes here. So we have an integration with Netsuite where it can pull data into these cards for you. So basically, you choose the information that you want to come through.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then at this time that's it can just pull through data. It can't do actions into Netsuite at this time, but it is on our roadmap.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  So, the integration is basically for like pulling up customer data right here within the email platform. So we can see like their invoice or purchase order information, like as we're responding to the email?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That's exactly it. Yep. Okay. Yeah.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  So, I noticed like maybe from Netsuite, you, can it look at a data point such as like the customer invoice amount or balance? Yeah, see, it says, balance. Okay. So could we then take that data a step further and say, can you prioritize the emails based on the customer size?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That I, that I don't think we can do at this time? No?

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  Yeah, no worries.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  Yeah. Is there any other features that I'm missing that we should ask about?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  I don't think so. I guess kind of going back to where you had, the tag where you can tag the remittance. What if we have like a, an actual email that I want to respond to that has the word remittance in it, for example, if the customer is asking… maybe asking me if you have received the remittance or something like that. And I, for that email that I do want to respond to the customer, would that get filtered out as well?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, we'd have to, we'd have to find a way like, I guess, how is there any way that we would, you would know that you needed to take action on it versus the other ones?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Probably not.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Well, cause the other thing is, right? Like basically, there's different ways that we can access it. But just to make this conversation as easy as possible today, there's a view that's all the emails associated are tied with those tags, right? So, if you had a remittance tag here instead of it saying accounts receivable here, this would show you where all the remittance emails are. So, even if it does get closed, you'd still be able to go back and see if you needed action, right? So, essentially, what I'm telling you is that it's probably going to be set up in a way where all the emails are getting closed. And then you can always see them. And if you can see which ones you need to take action on?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Gotcha. Okay.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  What other ways can we filter accounts or emails or set up automations? I think we talked about like, okay, we could filter by keyword, or we could filter by the email that is coming from, what other available filters are there?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So there, let me show you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, the, from emails, the two emails, subject body,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Those, yeah, these are really, the main ones right now, gotcha.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  And then, so did you mention in the beginning? Is there like a free trial that we can use?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Yep. There's a free trial here. And just a couple other things I want to show you too. Right. So, for these emails that come in to… the finance folder here, you're going to have your own mind section too, where you have the emails that you're handling. I know it's mostly, yeah, you're mostly handling this yourself or is there somebody else who handles these emails too? I forgot it's just you or, yeah.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Right now, just basically me, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. It is a minimum two people requirement at least to sign up for hiver, and then two goes to five. So, I don't know if Jack, if you also potentially wanted access into the account. But basically on these emails too, you hit the add mention button or, the hiver users pop up and you can communicate back and forth. It's like, hey, can you help on this email, right? So you can communicate here in hiver, you get notified up here. You can easily, you know, click on the email where you're communicating. We also have different approval flows as well. If this, you need to get approved by somebody else before taking any type of action. The other thing here is, you know, this is, obviously, it's more beneficial with more people in the account, but even with just two is the team view, this allows you to see all the open emails across the team. So, you know, in this finance folder, I have 49 open emails. These are the people that these emails are assigned to. You can also set up things like slas. So, this will be like if nobody responds to an email within X amount of hours, it's going to notify us, that, this one's late. So, I can easily see the late emails. I could see Cole has three emails on his plate. G, even has four on his plate. I can click. The other benefit of having something like this is, you can click on any of these emails and you can see all the back and forwards, right? You no longer have to CC people or anything like that. Anyone who has access to hiver, can see all the responses, the back and forwards, you know, like it, if you're out for the day and, you know, Jack or somebody else on your team needs to jump in to handle all the work that you were doing. They could easily do that. They could click on your name. They could see all the open emails that you have, and they can respond to all those emails and close them out, et cetera.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Cool. Yeah, cause right. Cause that's one of the other main things that people come to us for is they're like, hey, you know, we have this accounts receivable email. We have a team of five and we, you know, things are falling through the cracks. We never know who's responsible for what. We never know if things are getting responded to in a timely matter. And that's you know, one of the main reasons people come to us and they use something like it. But, yeah, I mean, for you guys here, we could set up filters, to close out those emails for you. We could explore some of these more AI features too. I think your feedbacks actually very good for us. What I'm going to also suggest here if you're open to it, I was going to set you up on another call here with my, with, my manager and he basically is, kind of, and then maybe somebody else from our AI team too, to see what we could do for you as far as these different workflows with AI. And then, yeah, we have a free trial. So, if you go on our site,

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  How long is the free trial?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  The free trial is seven days.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Seven days.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. It's fairly easy to get set up. You sign up. Once you sign in, it's going to ask you to connect, that email to your account. And then in the admin panels where you can set those automations, different AI things. And then also, we have instant chat support goes to a real person here at hiver. They'll hop on the phone with you if needed, anything like that as well. And, yep. So our pricing here, we have two packages here… trying to think here about the things that you need. I think, oh, you might need pro for the Netsuite integration. So it's 45 dollars a user a month annually or 55 dollars monthly, and the AI is an additional 20 dollars. Awesome. Yeah.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  Yeah. Sorry, that's yeah, that's great to know. Sorry, can you show the pricing one more time? I kind of missed that part.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we've got a couple packages here. I have to double check, I believe you need pro for the Netsuite integration. Okay. So it's 45 dollars a user a month. Like I said, it's a minimum two seat requirement. Then it goes in buckets of five. I'm going to send you all this via emails as well. And there's also, a month to month option if you prefer slightly higher. And then the only add on that we have is the AI. And AI includes all the AI features that we have, all the ones coming out soon, and it's an additional 20 dollars a user.

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  Awesome. Yeah, this is, like, I really appreciate this summary and I think as a next step, we would like to just ex, understand a little more like the full AI capabilities. So, I don't know like, yeah, if you want to send us like a write up or set up another call or something I think we are particularly interested in like the, kind of AI, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Let me do that. Let me pull up his calendar here real quick. Let me see here. Okay. You guys are in California?

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Could you meet maybe?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Would like 11 or 11 30 tomorrow might maybe work for you?

Jack Spencer (jspencer@plaid.com):
  Yes, those times work for me.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  So, me too.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. I'm going to do 11 30 looks a little better for him. And then I'll just send you a recap email. I'm going to introduce you to him as well. And, yeah, we'll go from there.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Okay, great. Thank you so much.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. It's really helpful. Yeah, I appreciate you too. And, yeah, look out for my email. Have a good one. Okay? Bye.
