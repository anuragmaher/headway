================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hi, Barry. Thank you for joining. Hi. How are you doing?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  I'm good. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well, thank you. Thank you for joining in again. Let me first of all, go ahead and introduce myself. This is the very first time we're catching up. My name is Rakesh and I take care of sales for european territory at hiver. I've been with the company for over four years, have personally onboarded more than 500 teams. So, I'll be the point of contact today. We'll run the show, understand, where do we currently stand in terms of using Gmail as a tool for managing your client emails? Customer communication? I'll tell you how hiver is helping a lot of companies in your space, typically managing these customer supports. And of course, we'll try and learn a little bit more about yourself, tell you what hiver does and see if this is a, good platform for you towards the end of the call.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Yeah, sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, very, first of all, do you want to tell me how do you currently manage the customer communications? Like all of these emails that do land into a common inbox, or do you have a dedicated team that work on all of those requests today?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  No, I'm using missive that's, I asked you, like, how did you find me? So you checked on G2, it's I believe for reviews and that's where you find me as a user.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right, great. Great. And for how long have you been using missive?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  One and a half, two years?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Now. Is there anything in particular that is missing in missive? By any chance? Or otherwise, I could tell you what hiver does and how we are different than missive?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  I'm doing a lot of automation. So, so yeah, my, just a little while ago, but what is important for me is that I can connect Gmail accounts that I can easily see what's coming in my colleagues accounts, and then I can take care of it. But as well, I'm, also managing 30 Instagram accounts, the DM, so I'm, also using it for that. So yeah, that's most important. I have whatsapp connected as well. One phone number now for some notifications and things. So, yeah, it's important for me that I can collect everything there. And, in missive, it was a bit of a challenge now, it's kind of solved but not entirely. They have a strange setup that, I never really got it. But, it's harder in missive to, how do you call that? If you give someone else access to your email inbox? So, what I had to do in missive, what I had to do in missive, is, when an email comes, in the inbox of my colleague, I need to, I need to assign the email to her. So I can see, so I can see which, conversations are assigned to my colleagues. And then, it works as a, delegated inbox, but yeah, I,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  was,

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  used from Gmail and stuff and other tools. And, and, an inbox of colleagues should just be on the left side. You click on a name or something like that, and you see exactly the same as they see. So, there is still a circumstance in missive that it could be that an email came in for my colleague and I don't see it or I assign something or, because they're also moving the messages to someone's inbox. And then it can be in someone's inbox, but it's not assigned to someone. And then, yeah, I really had to get used to those circumstances. It's just their way of thinking. But on the other hand, they were, cheapest by then, the features I could at least work with and it's super important for me to be able to have, public apis and prefer preferably, native make com modules because.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Because.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  I have all the conversations between my Instagram accounts and my user and the users, communicating with these Instagram accounts, I have them entirely run in open AI, conversations.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. So, you use message?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Shadow conversation, and the open AI is drafting all my messages, but the open AI also has access to some background information. And I really believe that for me, as a support company, as an agency, we're a social media agency. It's very important that I have one of my clients, Instagram accounts, background information, and some kind of prompt that I can give to tone of voice and blah, blah, blah to this conversation or per client.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  That is something that I built myself. But that is something that I was not able to find, on a, plan that I can afford. You know, these kind of things are only, available, in 200 euro, subscriptions, 200 euro a month, subscriptions. I see that in your, I have never looked at, other tools anymore. After that, I see that the price pricing in hiver is kind of, okay. I pay a similar amount to missive.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you want to tell me how much do we pay to missive today?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Oh, I can check that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure, and how many users are using today, the missive subscription?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  I only have two users in missive, because, I want to, I want to do that on a smallest possible level. So, I can, because it drafts all the messages for me. I can easily work there by myself, on all the email accounts that we have, on all the DM, accounts that we have, I do it all by myself. Let me see subscription billing. Where do I see my… latest invoice? They don't show that… invoices. It's, one 35 dollar.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  One 35 dollars for a month. Yeah.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Yeah, for a month, yeah, for two users. Okay? And then I have a setup with, automation, so I can make as many rules as I want.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  And, they, did build these rules now, but I believe that they have open AI prompts, and AI prompts in the rules. But it's not enough to be able to, draft all my messages and, those kind of things. Understood, that would be ultimate, circumstance if, my,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  customer's.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  account background information with tone of voice, and it usually restaurants and those kind of things. Got it. And that it would just draft the messages. It doesn't have to fully auto reply via DM on Instagram. I still want to see if the background information usually is correct, and, because and, and that's about it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood very clear. Very now, I get it that you have got two licenses with missive. You're paying almost 130 dollars a month. You're also using social media with open AI. I mean, you have an integration with make. Com and AI is helping you generate the responses, you verify the response, and then you send these email, I mean, responses on the social media through missive platform. But do you have a common inbox like a shared inbox where you receive emails from the customers today?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  I have one inbox. Okay. I receive all, the, my colleagues emails, no, this, the team email info at Nora, Maria, I receive whatsapp and 30 DM accounts, Instagram accounts. They all end up in that team inbox. And then, and then I can also see assigned to others, and that's my colleagues inbox. And I have my own inbox there.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And when you say assigned to others, colleagues inbox, I mean, do you also receive emails? I mean, do they receive emails in the personal inbox? Let's say if I have to contact, I'll contact your colleague directly in the inbox email, or can I use a common email address, which is info I.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  have an info, email address, but also the personal?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  For colleagues?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Also also a personal email address, And, okay. And, it's strange that they don't have delegated inboxes, That would be nice. But then I have to change her inbox into a team inbox. And then you pay extra for a team inbox. And I'm like just delegate delegated inbox, would just work. Understood. But, they just didn't build their system. And, so I found a workaround. So I assign every message to her. And then I can see what is assigned to others. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Now, can I also understand, with respect to managing the conversations from Instagram, I'm assuming because, you're into social creation, social media management, there are so many requests that are coming in from social media, your Instagram and everything. Yeah. Is that urgent for you to have Instagram management of communication? Like how many requests do you get in on Instagram today versus the emails?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Emails is very little. So, so Instagram communication, is main thing. So, I don't know now, but, in general, I have 30 accounts, I think that I have 25 conversations per account per month. Real conversations because I also have AI, pulling up, pushing out all the spam, so it's automatically closing, sales and spam, messages. So, yeah, if you take 30 times 25, then you have 750 conversations a month.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. So, basically, insta, Instagram is a real communication channel for you. Email is really little.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Yeah, email, is within our company. The email conversations are with leads and customers and invoices, and those kind of things. But most of the communication, is what we do for our clients, we offer social media management, and yeah, the DM management is part of it. So, yeah, most is through integrations. Do you, do you have a proper integration, with Instagram? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's the reason I wanted to actually understand it, and get a little bit more confident about it. Now, unfortunately, we do not have, social media integration at the moment, which is why, you know, I was thinking at the back of my mind that, hey, Barry, you know, what? This may not really be a good platform to pitch or, maybe, you know, take more time of yours, but we are working on it. Most likely, by next quarter, we will be ready with Instagram and social media integration. And I think that becomes a good point when I reach back to you and tell you, hey, Barry, now, we have got Instagram. Do you want to give me like 10, 15 minutes? I want to show that to you how hiver works. Do you think that's a good idea?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Yeah, definitely. And one, one very important thing and it's not easy for you to solve that. Instagram can, without a reason, disconnect you from missive?

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  And, and missive is, yeah, can't do so much about it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  But for me, it's super important. I cannot go to 30 accounts every day to see, if messages got through to missive. So, so what I eventually did, I built a mechanism that is sending three times a week. It, it's sending test messages in between accounts. So that I know that the account is still connected. I now have two emails sent to myself from the automation that states like connection with this. And this account got lost. So then I have to manually go to the account on my phone to check. Yeah, why if it's not connected and I have to see if I missed some messages and I have to in missive, I have to reconnect, but that is, yeah, if you can do something about having a stable connection, this must be a known issue to people that are often using the Instagram, integration, you will get disconnected. You will get disconnected but, yeah, it's a webhook. So you're receiving messages so you don't know what you're not receiving? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood that's very clear. So, thank you so much for the feedback. Makes a lot of sense. So, yeah, I mean, I'll definitely make a note of it and of course, forward it to my product team. The day we will be launching Instagram, we'll reach out to you and we'll make sure we offer you a stable platform so that if the testing and everything works really good, we can always look at how you could start to use hiver. But yeah, not immediately. I think you're all good for now. We don't have Instagram at the moment, but I understand the feedback, appreciate your feedback on connection which is non stable at the moment. And definitely, you'll be looking to fix that sooner or later. Of course, you can't go to all 30 accounts, look at those Instagram messages personally, that's not scalable today. You've got 30 clients tomorrow. You may have 300 clients. It is just not possible to check manually. So I get it. Barry.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  No. So I built the flow but yeah, there is probably no way to keep the connection. That is even more impossible. Probably. But yeah, just know it's important. So, I see that you have AI on hiver, meet hiver, your smart teammate for all customer service touchpoints. What does it? Do? It composes? You can ask?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Basically, it is a very much email heavy AI. Like today. You said you don't get many emails, but we heavily work on the email part of things. Let's say if you receive emails into info inbox, hiver, AI will look at the email, tag the email for you and say, hey, this is about X y Z as a tag, help you understand the customer sentiment, whether or not it's a sad customer, happy neutral customer, look at the tonality of the email, help you draft the responses. If this is about cancellation, we'll pick up the request from the cancellation. We'll look at your knowledge sources wherever you know, you've got faqs uploaded and everything. So it can do pretty much everything that an agent has to do with a lot of AI functionalities. Think of summarizing a conversation composing an email replying on agent behalf, tagging that automatically looking at the customer sentiments, but it is not on social media management but on the email side of things.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Yeah. So for me, it only makes sense if you have an Instagram integration. Absolutely. Your agent is also capable of doing activities on social media conversations.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. We'll reach out to you once we have social media integration. And for now, thank you still so very much for your time. Lovely. Catching up with you. And, yeah.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Sure. Go ahead and tiktok.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Not really at the moment, like nothing from social media to be very fair with you.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  No, no, no. I know that you don't have it now, but is tiktok on? I?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Will check, I will check Facebook, Instagram, and tiktok. I will check that for you. Yeah.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Because many chats does do tiktok, but it… only works that it's in beta. I don't know what, but there is no platform that you can now use as a central inbox for tiktok. And that's why I cannot offer my clients that I do DM management on tiktok, and it's… one of the bigger deal breakers for us to not be able to sell social media campaigns on tiktok because if we do it, we really want to have a good representation for our customers on tiktok. And currently, we are not able to do that because, yeah, if you cannot respond to a DM or a comment, yeah, it's not so nice.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Yeah, made a note of it and we'll keep you posted about it. All right. Yeah. All right. Great. Thank you so much for your time.

Barry Koeman (barry@noramaria.nl):
  Have a nice day.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Goodbye.
