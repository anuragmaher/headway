Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Melanie.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Hi Cole.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How are you?

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  I'm good. Thanks. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice. I'm doing well. I'm doing well.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Good. Sorry, I'm off camera. I'm just kind of coming down with a cold today.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, all good, do whatever you're most comfortable with. But I appreciate you hopping on the call here today. So just to set a quick agenda, I would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role, what got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions?

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Okay. Sounds good.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Well, yes. So I work in food service sales for the good crisp company. To be honest, I don't know a lot about hiver. I just got this invite on LinkedIn and I figured why not would be curious to learn more about it, who you guys are, but yeah, I've been with the company about seven months now coming from an upcycled food startup and moving to a better for you potato chip company. So, both emerging brands, but just at very different stages, I do a lot of travel for my work, a lot of sampling at in person events. But then there's also a lot of follow up work that happens through our CRM and everything. And we're always curious about how to streamline things like that. So, yeah, that's a kind of quick overview in a nutshell.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. No, that's super helpful. And you're using Gmail or outlook today from an email client perspective?

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Outlook.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many emails, shared inboxes are you managing today as an organization? Is that something that you're aware of?

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  I don't think we really use shared inboxes. Everybody pretty much just manages their own, but I do have another team member that we have visibility to each other's, leads and follow ups and emails through our shared CRM that's just for the two of us for our channel?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So you're not using like shared inboxes today, like distribution lists at the good Chris company. It's pretty much just individual emails today.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Yes, for my purposes, yes, I think other people might use distribution lists, but I do not.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah, because that's really where we come into play. Melody. We help teams better manage like shared inboxes distribution lists because we find it's very hard for people to internally collaborate and delegate emails once the volume gets high and the team gets larger without stepping on each other's toes. So we provide a tool that just helps manage that better. But we'd love to, you know, I know, like there wouldn't be a use case for your team or like within your like purview, but I was wondering if there's a chance that you can maybe introduce us to some folks at the business or just send some over some information and see if there would be interest to pursue this further?

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  There might be possibility. Yeah. Is it possible to still get a little bit of an overview of like, I don't know if you had a deck or something or just kind of to get a feel for what you guys, how your solutions work?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. I can just, I can share my screen right here. Okay?

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Cool.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But, yeah. So essentially we are, you'll log into this hiver application with your Microsoft sso and you're going to have access to one, your personal inbox up top, and then there's distribution lists or shared inboxes below that you're managing as an organization.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Oh, okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, clicking on the mindview, right? This is everything that's been assigned to me. But on the right hand side of these emails, we can do different tasks, right? We can do things like assign conversations, track the status, whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks, adding those tags for organizational purposes, as well as tracking custom data.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we provide like a space to collaborate if you ever need to bring someone into a conversation to collaborate internally.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Oh, nice. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So just kind of like creating a space to easily collaborate on emails as they come in, assign them, track them, provide analytics. And… yeah, all that good stuff. So we do provide that workload analytics understanding active new resolve conversations over a time period, what our average first response time is as a group, what our average resolution time is… and then the per user metrics. So like emails assigned per user sent out per user and individual performance metrics below.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Oh, nice. Okay. Cool. I mean, I love the look of it. It's super clean and seems easy to use.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, for sure. That was like, you know, designed that was intended, we wanted this to be an easy tool, easy to adopt because we see that a lot of competitors in our space, just like add a lot of fluff and stuff that people don't necessarily need. So, we're just kind of like cutting down on some of the fat, just providing those essentials while keeping the team effective.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Yeah, totally. Okay. Cool. How long have you guys been around? Are you like a newer company? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we have, oh, sorry that's so hot. Leave me right now. We've been around for over seven years. Let me just turn my notifications off. I apologize for that.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Oh, that's okay.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Okay. Seven years is not so new.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we've been around for seven years, have over 2000 paid customers and, you know, pretty much are global from that front as well.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Wow. Okay. Cool.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I can share some more information with you, Melody and this call recording. Okay? And if you could just pass this information along internally, that would be awesome. And if there's any interest, you know, from the greater group, we can, you know, always hop on another call.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But it was great to meet you, Melody. I hope you have a great weekend and I will talk to you soon.

Melanie Brkich (mbrkich@thegoodcrispcompany.com):
  Sounds good. Thanks you too.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Take care. Bye bye.
