================================================================================

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on guys?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Hello? How you doing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good. How is everything with y'all,

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  it's working.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. What was the, what did the issue end up being?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  He had to install hiver, the way you would install something to work on a Chromebook as opposed to in a domain or in a Google group. So rich should be able to, you know, to be able to tell you the technical, but that was basically it. So, he took everything away other than what you would, how you would install and I think it was a URL as opposed to the extension.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, yeah. So you signed in but it's currently installed in your Gmail environment. It's.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  working. Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Just wanted to confirm.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We're seeing what we're supposed to be seeing. Yes, yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. But yeah, I wanted to serve this call as just a way to take y'all, through a tour of hiver as well. So, if one of you wants to share your screen, I can take you through.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Some of the instructions, share my screen, our screen helps.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, oops. And now it's gone again. Okay. Let's.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  see, try refreshing.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Your screen. Oh, do you know why? No? Because I'm on a different machine. Oh, well, try and see if you can install that thing here. Fresh. Let's see if that helps. It's working on our individual machines. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, so you're on like a communal laptop type thing?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Because Chrome is local. Yeah, I can't it's in the way. Hold on one second. This is in the way… just minimize and, make it where the heck is the extension?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, it's on your other device. So, yeah.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, try downloading again on this one.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah, we'll go back to the Chrome extensions here. We go visit Chrome web store.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Or you can just do manage extensions either way.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah. Again?

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Yeah, you just go to, yeah, you're going there, you're going there? Well?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, Richard. What's going on right here?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Nice to see you and,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  this.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  thing keeps just minimize it click on this right there we go. Yeah.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  And then add to Chrome. I.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Can minimize, I know what minimize means? Oh, no, it's only making the top thing go. It's not making the pictures go away. That's so weird, that is… it's still going to be working?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Let's see it should load up now is.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  This, okay, material did not call me back. I did minimize it, yeah, but it just got rid of it. There we go. There we go. Everybody's gone now. So, any reason this hasn't started yet?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Try go to manage extensions.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, you just refresh… manage extensions here. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  It looks like it's on.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I don't know why? Let me get someone.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Do you ever have people who work on multiple machines that need to be?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Able to, oh, there it is there, it is right there. Perfect. And yeah, yeah, we do. So you just have to download these. There you go. That's perfect.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Oh, yeah.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  When I uninstalled and reinstalled, I had to do that. So we've been messing around in here. So, yeah, you're up five to six.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. I.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  know, well, let me do the last one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, how I like to start these team is the first way to leverage hiver and get some great use out of it. Click on the special Ed inbox on the left and then go scroll down to tags… then click on those. So, yeah, this is a good place to create. These are similar to shared labels, right? So this is where you can add additional tags to organize conversations, put them in specific buckets or folders for you to organize specific queue types for your team to manage?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Is this different than labels? Yeah. Is this different than labels? Can we upload a whole bunch of tags all at once?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So not currently, actually, we might be able to upload the tags at once. Let me get back on that and how?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Many tags can we use?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Unlimited. So you have unlimited tags… but yeah, just a good place. So you hit the plus sign top right right there. Yep. And then that's where you'll create them.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Right. So we would say urgent, maybe, do you want to create it? Yeah, two queues. Well, I don't think it matters. We're just creating it, right? Just to create. Oh, that already exists. No wonder. All right. So, which one do I want to do billing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's perfect. Billing is a good example. All right. OK, awesome. And the more you create of these, the more options you'll have on the conversations to apply tags manually… but you can also apply them automatically using automations on the back end.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah, I have questions on automations.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Go ahead.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, on automations, we were looking… helpscout, gives us a regex pattern that we can use on the subject line. We're looking at assigning these in sections of route numbers. So starting with 24,000 all the way up to 24,999. Is that something that we can do? Because that, I couldn't quite see in the product?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, being able to route based on things in the subject line?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yes, but very specific things. If it has a number between 24,000 or 24,999, it would go to a specific person.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Gotcha. Yeah. So that should be a capability that we have. You go to the automation section?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Which is up here?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, admin panel.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Admin panel, shared inboxes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  And then automations?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah. So create an automation, New conversations received. Yep. All right. So, if.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  if condition, let's do the select condition, you know, subject line?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  It's not a keyword, so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You can change contains any of.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Any of.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And you can put, you can put values in there too.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, 24,000, is it a range?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I don't know if it can search through the range specifically. But if it has like.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We have 543 routes starting with 16,000 all the way up to 26,000. So looking.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  To.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  automate that, and that would be a question. We would need answered if we could automate it based on the subject or in the body, if they mention it, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You can do it in the body as well. So, if you click on subject line, it.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Doesn't understand. Does it understand math symbols like greater than or equal to order?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me just ping my technical support team on that.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Because we wouldn't want to have to put in multiple keywords, 24,000, 24,001, 24,002. Yeah. And you guys wouldn't like that either, because it would make it very ugly. How many lines does an automation allow?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How many different lines?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah. In the automation, so, you have, you know, body contains any of subject contains any of, yeah. Well, I mean, how many conditions? Yeah, how many conditions?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, you can get very granular. So hit on or condition right there? I don't know the hard limit to that, but you can get, you know, very granular within those conditions and adding and layering things on top. So, whether it's so hit the, or condition below.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You said, just throw in something there for safe example.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah. So we just keep going and going.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. And then you can add another condition. After this. You can kind of keep drilling down into these conditions. I have someone on our technical support team joining now who can talk about more of the limitations and stuff like that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, what's up? What's up? Som?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Hi, Cole. How are you doing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Doing good. We just have some technical questions around potential limitations from the conditions in the automations. But before we get into that one actually, are we able to search for, you know, values in the subject line between a range? Like can we understand the conditions, like between certain values, additions, stuff like that?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Or like a regex pattern?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  In the subject line? Yeah… I'll have to check that. Let me confirm that Cole, just a minute.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  All… right. That would be really important because helpscout does have that. Yeah. Okay. The regex pattern in the subject line, not necessarily in the body, but if we could do it in both, that would be great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. So, yeah, he'll get back to that answer. He's probably just consulting with our technical support team. Yeah. What are some other things that, you know, we can help touch on today while we get the answer to those?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  If we were migrating from helpscout to hiver, we… wouldn't have the conversations. We wouldn't have the sense from helpscout. We would have what came into helpscout in Gmail, you'd have everything in Gmail.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  You want the regex search to be a condition in shared inbox automations, or?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Got it. We.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Want to be able to say, search the subject line for routes that are 24,024 1999 and send it to this person. But if it's 25,025 1999, we want to send it to a different person.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Got it. I think that works in our automation. So, regex does support an automation, let me just confirm it once.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  The other thing, I couldn't see the conversation id when I opened up. Oh, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, go into the email and I'll show you that now. Yep. So if you go back and then, yeah, click on any one of those emails… and then see in the top right there's like a link button, it's like a little like, yeah, click on that… and then scroll down conversation id and then keep scrolling down. You can see, you can actually share the link with people too.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Can you search on the link?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, you can search for these conversation ids within the Google search.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  If I print this, will the conversation id go on the printout?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, I don't believe, so, some will be able to confirm that as well because this is internal, right? What would be the purpose for printing the email?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Hold on. Let's just pretend.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  So, sorry, kukul. So using match case option in automation should work, match case for subject line. If it's the exact match for subject lines when we are looking as a condition in automation?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Match case? Yes, regex pattern or?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  That is right. That is right. So, you have to, there'll be a checkbox called match case. So, when you are let's say using the subject line as the condition, you can check that box and you can use the regex pattern in that particular field. That should, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We can walk through that now too. You can also, this is all testable as well. This is something we can make sure it works before we… proceed or anything like that.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  If condition, right? If the body or subject?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Yeah, subject.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Matches. Yeah. And that's where we would use our regex. Okay?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Correct. It says, enter your regular expression, so you can paste it here and that should.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Work. I'm saying chat, gpt make me a regex pattern. Oh, let's call this. I can't take it which works much better than me trying to do it from scratch. Yeah, subject matches and then the regex pattern, can we do the same thing for the body? Yeah, you should be able.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  To, so, is that something we can also do for the body?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Oh, I'm sorry. So, for the match case, it works, it doesn't work for the body regex as in regex pattern. It would work for the subject lines? Yes. Okay.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. All right. And so we were going back to what we were talking about before. Oh, we were talking about the conversation id that it's not printing? Is that a problem? If we copy the conversation id into the file name?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Would you copy it into the subject line? Copy id there's? The conversation id, right? So we were naming it, we were printing it to PDF. Yeah, that would work, right? That's fine. Okay. We can do a workaround for that one?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I mean, in theory, though, if you could get the id number on the printout or on the email itself, that would be great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. I can definitely give that product feedback to my team.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And anything else team while you've had time to test and poke around that we can cover on the call here today that were outstanding questions?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We really like this split conversation into a new thread. I was curious, yeah… because that's a big deal for the other side contacts. Did we want to talk about contacts? Yeah. So have you gotten an answer back about contacts and company names here?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So right now, we don't have that specific request built out in terms of importing like historical contacts or things of that nature. Like right now, the way solomon correct me if I'm wrong. The way we create contacts in hiver is when they reach out to us directly and then hiver creates it on the backend.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  That is correct. Cole. Yeah, it's auto created based on the email conversations that comes to the shared inbox.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Right. But you said that it uses the domain name as the company name, correct?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  The problem with that is we have that's not the company, right? We have 95 percent of our companies are using Gmail or hotmail, yeah, or hotmail, or yahoo. Yeah. So that would not be helpful for us with regard to looking up a contact by a company… because they have multiple Gmail accounts. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I know what you're saying. There's a lot of Gmail domains. Is there a?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Way for us to manually edit these? Because it looks like they're grayed out up to a point, right? I can go into edit, but the only thing I can change is the name and add a note. So, is the full name, the company name?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So right now, I spoke with my CTO about this. He said there's no way to currently edit the company's names within the product. This would need to be built as an enhancement, but I need to speak with my product team further because we just got back about this week about what it would look like to build it.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I went to a M. Yeah, because they use Gmail. So if you click on edit, the only thing we can edit is name and notes. Oh, oh, so we can't edit the company name.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's correct. That's not something we can do today, but I can reach out to my product team to understand what it would look like to build that and then give you an estimated timeline.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. I also had a question when we were talking about that shoot just went out of my head talking about contacts. Shoot just went out of my head. Oh, yes. Variables. I know that you've got email templates. Can you automatically fill in variables in the email templates?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, yes, you.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Can do that. Yes, you do have the options for name and other few fields for variables. When you create it, you'll get the option for placeholders that's variable. So, you see that?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I saw it before. Yeah, this one?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  This one, yeah, correct. I'll share the template with you. I'm sorry, the knowledge base article that can help you when you create it, that would.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Be great. All right. That would be great. Please. I'm okay with that. All right. So, same for us here would be email templates… and we can use variables. I think that's mostly my questions. Great. Do you have any other questions? I mean, we might not want to set it up around Robin. We might want to set it up the other way that we're looking at the route numbers we saw when we went into here, my settings. So my settings, delete confirmation. I'm not sure what that's for that was on already.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Let me see.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  So, this is actually a pop… up that comes up. So basically, at times in case, if anybody by mistake, deletes an email from a shared inbox, if, in case they hit the delete button, there'll be a prompt. When you have this enabled, it will give a prompt like a confirmation whether they really want to delete an email, shared inbox email. If you have this disabled, it directly behaves like how Gmail does, right? It'll go to the trash folder. But if it's enabled, yeah, I'll give an alert like a thing like if you want to delete the shared inbox email? Okay?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Reverse order of messages in the conversation, we saw it's in beta testing that's showing the most current at the top, right?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Yes, that is right. Yeah. And.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We like the keyboard shortcuts. We did nothing with the channel notifications. We wouldn't want to put on desktop notification for shared emails, that would be a pain in the neck. And we didn't touch this because there's really nothing in here. I guess my question in here under special Ed. Trans, it's going to show my name, but it's always going to show the email address as special Ed. Trans.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  That is correct. That is correct. Christine. So.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  If I turn this on, they would know that Kristen self sent it.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Yeah. So when you have my sent turned on in your Gmail sent folder, there'll be a section for all sent and my sent. So my sent will specifically show the emails. So when you are accessing my sent, you'd see the emails that have been sent by you. All sent will show all the emails that have been sent from the shared inbox address. So it's more like a segregation between the shared inbox emails sent by all the team members and the person who is looking into.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  It, if I assign something to myself, does it automatically say it's sent by me?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  No. So, when you assign the email to yourself in the shared inbox, it would show under your mine folder. Like it's been assigned to you? No, it.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Will not.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Show under my sent unless you have sent a reply on that email using the shared inbox. I don't.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  think we want this on. I think we want this off. Yeah. What does it show as a signature?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It can show your own personal signature that's all done within the Gmail settings. Okay? So it can be your personal signature that people see, but they can just see the shared mailbox id.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We have to play around with it a little bit more. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And I'm happy to extend.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  the.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  trial out by a couple additional days here as well because I know it took a little bit to get up and running to give you some more time.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I'm going to switch to the demoing box if that's okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, sure.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  In the demo inbox, there's a lot of these happy and we wouldn't need these spaces. Well, I think that's.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  the sentiment analysis and we can do things like escalate conversations based on our AI sentiment analysis. So it just gives you a gauge on how people are feeling and prioritizing.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Can we turn that off? Yeah. Can we turn that, the, yeah, we really don't need. And I understand it's just like a note saying that it's been a long time. So we can, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And this is, and this is just for that inbox as well, right? Like if you want, we can remove the demo inbox entirely.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  No, no, I'm meaning if we want to put it on our side, like the happy faces and the unhappy faces we don't really care about. However, I want to say this hasn't been dealt with. This hasn't been dealt with. So, I'm curious. Yeah. Does that, does that pop if it, if it's been a while? Does it pop it back up to the top of the line, the top of the inbox?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Does it pop it to the top? So we'll just show that it'll just pop right in general for… the frt?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  The resolution… can we set, and can we set the time limits? We don't want it popping up every.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  time. Yeah. So, you can set, you can set the time limits so that's all here. I'll show you on the back end, click on the admin panel.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  You would maybe want it popping back up after three days, exactly. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, click on the admin panel. I'll show you where you can create these back there.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Again?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Back there, admin panel, go to shared inboxes on the way left, go to special Ed, trans, go down to SLA now.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah. I didn't get further than automations.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then create policy.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, this is where you're going to create slas, you can have different slas, set off by tag type.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Time period, maybe.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You can have one general one. You can have specific slas, totally depends on what you want to do, but then below, yeah, apply to all conversations. You don't need to apply a tag?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Overdue there we go. Yeah, first within. So here we would put what? 72 hours?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  First response is 72 hours. Yeah. Okay.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Zero minutes… notify assignee… notify if it's not done within five… days, notify supervisor, can you assign it to a supervisor? Do you really want to do that nope?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, you can do assign, you can do assignee and assigner. So whoever assigns it to someone will be notified? They don't take care of it.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. So here, how do we switch that? How are they notified? Do they get that email or do they, they'll.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  be notified on the bell icon in the top, right? Like it'll be like you have a notification up there? Oh,

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  okay. Or we could say, and how will, it will identify the email by the email tag or number? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. It just, it'll be for every email that comes in. This is a general one. For every email that comes in, you can create it. So a certain tag will apply a different SLA. So up to you if you want just one general one or maybe there's a couple different requests that require different SLA. So up to you how you want to set that up?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Go to the top of the heap. Okay? All right. That makes sense. And then this is where they know they're not, they get notified.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, exactly. So click on that right there. And then this is where you'll be. Oh, you got to actually X out of the admin panel. The admin panel is blocked. So this is where you'll be notified.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  But you can also see it under mine. If you've been assigned something.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. Mine or the assign to me section, is this?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  The only, how about your notes? Like, if I assign somebody a note on a conversation, would they be notified here or would they only see it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  They'll they'll be notified here. So if I at mention you on a conversation, you'll be notified right there as well and you can click on these notifications and they'll pull you to the thread.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Perfect. Okay. And that gets you closer to what you need to do. It pulls you to the.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Thread. So you don't like search it like you'll just like at mention my name and I'll click on the notification and I'm right there immediately.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  But if Sharon had a, had something come in through the workflow and she was overwhelmed, she could reassign it to me with no problem.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. And then you'll be notified that she assigned something to you.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. And if the workflow is going on in the background, it's not going to keep reassigning it to Sharon.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  What do you mean by that in terms of?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Let's say she's assigned around 25,000. If I, if she has to reassign it to me because she's backed up, but the workflow is automatically assigned it to her. Does it keep assigning it to her?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No. So once she pushes it off it'll stay with you, it's just the initial automation, but if she's swamped, she can push it off.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. And it will keep going back to her. Yep. All right. Any other questions? I think part of this is going to be doing dummy stuff to each other. Okay? I don't rich. You got any questions?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And I know, yeah, go ahead.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Nothing outside of what you guys were asking for right now. I mean, there's a procedural question for, I guess eventually I'm not going to be a part of that because I don't need to see any of the special trans emails in my inbox. So I guess the question would be like how easy is that to turn on and off or engage with as far as a user's perspective goes? And then a secondary question is what happens to a user that's also using outlook at the same time? He?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Should not be using outlook especially because of that split. Once we go to Google. Yeah, that split conversation. If we on hiver.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. You'd have to be in Gmail to use this solution. That is what's recommended in terms of like if you're talking about, are you talking about user provisioning? Like if you want to give up your seat or something?

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Or, or just like say, for example, I'm not going to be an active user for special Ed, trans. So I don't necessarily need to see or engage with any of these emails or need to be a part of that. As far as the administration is, I mean, I would only need to help out in the, you know, like settings changing kind of thing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you can just exclude yourself from receiving any like conversations from that mailbox. And just remain, you can just remain an admin, you don't have to be a part of the mailbox. You can just remain admin of overall hiver.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Okay. Sounds sounds good. And then, on that outlook side since I do use outlook on my end.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  You use outlook, yeah.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So,

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  at the start of our journey with hiver, after we got everything up and running, I did notice that outlook does create a tagged… folder… structure and has been starting to download the messages that have been delivered into hiver, oh, no, into my outlook box. So like that's, that was something that was like, all right. Well, eventually, I'm going to get rid of those. So I hope I don't there's no two way sync as far as, the outlook users is concerned, cause I, you know?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that shouldn't be an issue that's just your individual mailbox that won't affect the source account of the share mailbox.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Okay, cool. So, so, you know, at that time, you know, we can then clear those emails out of a user's outlook and not have to affect the global box.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And so, can you confirm that? Just, just, I think he's on mute.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, just the email, the special like trends or emails are downloading?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Sorry, you there? Somm?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Yes, yes. Cool. So, just to confirm, like, is it that outlook you want to access the shared inbox emails from outlook or what?

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Oh, no, yeah, no, I don't have any interest in receiving any of the shared messages into my outlook at all?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Why not?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  He was just receiving labels from hiver into his outlook, and I just wanted to confirm it won't affect the source account of the shared mailbox. Yeah, if.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  I remove them, yes.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  It should not, it should not affect, so, it should not be affecting the flow to the sync, to the actual shared inbox, that should not be a problem.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, I just want, I just want to double. Confirm. All right, cool. All right. Awesome.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  That's that's basically it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. And something to note as well team like if you do follow with hiver, like we are, like, we do provide that implementation onboarding services with customer success managers. So, we'll have someone who will be guiding you through this whole process as well.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I don't know if he's using outlook for it, all right? So, but.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But when would be a good time? Kristen to touch base? You know, I can extend the trial out. Would same time on Monday, work for you to see, you know, how the progress has gone since now and then we're.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  gone, we're at literally all of the four of us are gone on Monday to go somewhere. No. Okay. You're out Tuesday. How about this Friday? Why don't we do it this Friday and try to mess around with it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's, I can do same time on Friday too if that works?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  With, can we do it a little bit earlier on Friday?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. How's how's 11 a. M est on Friday 11?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  A, M is fine.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. So, I'll send that over and then perfect. So, I appreciate the time today, team. Happy, we were able to answer some of those outstanding questions and then.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  And you're gonna get back to us about whether or not we can upload the tags all at once. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm gonna get back to you on that and get that confirmation and.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah, you're gonna find out about the company name as well?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I'll see if that's something that's feasible from a product development perspective, and see what that timeline would look like. Is this, is that a make or break feature it?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  It would be helpful. It would be helpful to be able to say all these emails are under this company, right? Individually, doesn't really help us too much.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, they have, they're all, you know, they're not all big companies, they're like mom and pops. So they might have, Sharon would have an email with scsc transportation, Phil would have a separate email. I'm accounting. I would have a separate email, but all of them are with scsc transportation. So, yeah, it would be helpful to be able to see groups of emails in the contacts. And I'm sorry, with the one, one more question about if you can go into, go back into the contacts here. Yes. Where'd it, go there? It, is there it is and go into one. Are we only allowed one phone number per company?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I thought it did, no, it shows it, but it doesn't let us do it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I think you have to add that from the source. So click on one of those conversations. Okay. Hit edit, actually. Yeah, sorry, what?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Did it do now? You're in the conversation? Yeah. But all my stuff disappeared. No, there it goes. Okay. So in here, where can we click on the contact and see the contact card? And?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then hit the three dots edit and.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  it should, it's not there?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, do you know why? So let them edit the contact or add the phone number? I don't think so. Cool. So we don't have an option to do it if it's somebody. So if it's synced with the contact, it would auto populate there.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Got it. So it's just not, it's not, where would it pull the phone number? Right? If it's in the country?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Do you know where it's calling from? We've got our email. It should be from the Google contact itself. Let me confirm this one. Okay. Yeah. So I guess it's just pulling from the Google information.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The Google information from where… like Google contacts? Yeah, I think from like your personal or the company one, whatever it might be. He's confirming though.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So if we beefed up our special Ed, trans contacts, we would have more information in that dairy, maybe. Yeah. So that's what we gotta look at is that, can we, is that something that if we have a Google sheet that can be imported, I'd have to, I'd have to look because there's certain things you can do and there's something you can't do. Yeah. All right. Any other questions? Not at the moment? Right? No, thank you very much Cole.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Thank you. Yeah. Well, thank you guys so much. I appreciate the time. I will, I'll follow up on the bulk importing of the tags and then also the ask about the editable contacts and importing contacts. And I'll get back to you on both those asks.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you guys. Take care.
