Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  hey, Cole.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, Hallie, how are you? Good?

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Everybody's here. So please show them your system. Okay? Awesome. Hold on. Can everybody hear him? No, can you talk much louder? Cole? Because you're on my laptop and I don't think I can get it any louder.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. How's this? Can you guys hear me now?

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  We'll be quiet. Okay. Yes, go ahead, okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Perfect. All right. Let me hop into this here today. So, yeah, thanks for everyone for joining. Feel free to stop and ask any questions as we go through the demonstration, but I appreciate the time here today. So let me share my screen one second.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So taking a look at my screen here team, what's nice about hiver is we did make it a simple but very yet effective tool to use at the same time. So, you're going to log into this application with your Microsoft or sso, whatever it might be, Google login, Microsoft, whichever credentials that you have. And then on the left hand side, we're going to have your personal inbox up top for personal email communications. And then below that the shared inboxes that we're managing as an organization. So for this example, let's take a look at, you know, the support shared mailbox. So when we click into this, it opens up some subviews beneath it, that helps us manage the intake of communications. So, the first is the mine, everything that's been assigned to me… the unassigned section, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be distributed. And then the team view, you know, really just understanding from a high level perspective, what's outstanding, and what needs to be completed across the group. I want to pause here. Any questions so far? Show?

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Them the status because you showed them assigned Cole, but you didn't say like how do I know what's assigned? How do I know what's unassigned? What status is my email in?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. 100 percent. So clicking into an email here, right? On the right hand side, a hiver tab is going to open up as we're working through the email communications where we can do a couple different things. The first is assigning it. In this case, I'll assign to myself, letting the team know I'm going to take ownership and work through this email communication. The next way that we can assign work is a round Robin automation that equally distributes. You don't.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Need to talk about assigning keep going.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. Tracking the status, whether it's open pending or closed ensuring nothing slips between the cracks. We're working through the resolutions understanding where it is. Well.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  That's is it, has, it, is it has it like in sedna, is it red? Like has it been red? Is it pending? So it's being worked or is it closed in archive? Yes. And can they set other statuses? Can we custom that Cole?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, no, these are standard statuses. Okay?

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we have tags. So a great way to organize conversations, put them in buckets, folders, reviews. We can also report on these tags on the backend and then custom fields. So we can't customize the statuses today. But you can create custom fields to track maybe where something is, you know, in progress and what's going on. Okay?

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Show them the, yeah, right there, the kind of like activities and how they track everything. And then the message threading please.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. So then there's the notes section where we can collaborate internally. So I'm sending a notification to matt, he'll receive that notification over here on the top left.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  He can click on.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It, it'll take him right to this thread where we can kind of keep having that back and forth internal conversation. And we have an entire activity log of what's happened on this thread. So I've assigned it to myself. I've updated the request type to booking. And then I, you know, chatted with matt being like, hey, you know, let's get you in here. I need some help on this conversation.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  And the activity field includes tags, this is put on or put off and who's seen it when? Correct?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's exactly correct. So I'll just add it for an example, you know, champion identified. It just showed that I added the tag champion. The SLA has been applied and then, you know, we go from there… any questions on that team?

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Showing the message threading, like if there's multiple responses back and forth, yep.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, right now, I'm on this thread, right? We also have like email templates. So if you want to like, you know, streamline a response, we'll just like pop this in wherever that might be. I'll send this. We keep everything in one thread in one conversation for your team, making it really easy to manage those conversations. So Manoj reached out, you know, on this conversation, I just responded and we can just kind of keep having this conversation on this thread where it all stays together.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  And let's say there's no one assigned to it. So if it's closed, no one's assigned it'll, just come back into unassigned and whoever's on duty can work it, correct?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So totally depends, right? So, the person who worked it, if they're offline, typically, it'll go back to the person who worked it last since they have the context. But if you don't want that to happen, you can do send close and unassigned. So if they reach back out, it'll automatically go to that unassigned section. So totally up to you on how you want that to function, it can either be automatically reassigned if that thread gets reopened to the same person or if you want it to go back just to the unassigned section? We can do that also.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  How do you know if somebody's online or not?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we have the availability status, let me move this.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  So if they log out when they leave, does that automatically change their availability?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that would be controlled by the manager or the person individually, admins have access to control that as well.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Okay. So basically, you're saying every day when they leave, they'd have to change their status here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That is correct. Oh… you have to be out of office or in office.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  So, because if you're tagged on it and somebody responds, it's going to go back to you only if you're assigned to it is what he's saying. We'll discuss it further, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I can switch people off. Like I'm an admin on this. So I could just switch people off where I see fit.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  But you can see other emails that have come into other people, correct?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So in the team view. So even if that happened, like I can see what everyone's working on in real time. What's assigned to each individual and see where things are in status. See everyone's replies, you have total visibility into what the team is doing on in real time.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Okay. Guys, we got two minutes. You see how this kind of functions and works, you can see the tags? What questions do you have for Cole… thinking about our process? Okay? And y'all saw we can create the tags we need. Does that include like private tags as well? Like how we did with sibna? Do you have private tags, Cole, or only team? Well, yes, because I assume Cole, it's associated with the mailbox, so if you have your personal, you can have personal tags.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can have personal tags up top if you'd like, okay?

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Does that apply to the group as well? Like you can have a personal tag that's only yours in the team.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, everyone has visibility into the shared inbox tags. Okay? And then I think you mentioned searchability as well. So we have the ability to search the inboxes with all these different kinds of filters, search, keywords, inboxes from two subjects. We can really drill down into what we're searching for.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  And you can put multiple filters on to find it, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  And then can you save that if it's something you do often?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That would be more in our saved.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Views?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, that would be more in our views like down here. So being able to go down to all views. So if you want to see all like billing requests, escalation requests, we can have more specific customizable folders based on the, you know, requests we're looking to keep tabs on… okay?

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  It is 1,110 guys. Any questions for Cole? Thank you, Cole. Thank you, Cole. We appreciate your time, sir.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, thank you guys. And then Hallie, do you have a quick second to touch base just for a couple minutes after this?

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Not right now. I don't.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  okay. Okay, cool. I'll just follow up with you over email, but I appreciate the time.

Hallie Pendleton (hallie.pendleton@gwtllc.net):
  Yes, sir. Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Take care. Bye bye.
