Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  There we go. I think.

Vivian Liu (vivian@manual.co):
  Hi, Susie.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  How are you doing?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Fine. Thank you. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you so much. Perfect. I think we have everyone. Shall we get started with the discussion? All right. Great. First of all, thank you both of you for booking the demo with us.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So I'll be helping you with the evaluation. My name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver. So the agenda for today's meeting is fairly simple. I would love to first understand what is it that you're trying to solve or the challenges that you're currently working on understanding that will help me sort of give you a tailored demonstration of the platform and how hiver will sort of tick those boxes for you. So, yeah, over to you. If you could just help me understand a bit about what you're looking for. We can take it from there.

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  So, currently, we are using Zendesk. Okay. So we have several outlook emails that will filter into Zendesk into different buckets. We also use our phone through that as well. For phone calls. We're looking to add a whatsapp to it as well. It's been a bit difficult hasn't it to add the whatsapp to Zendesk at the moment, it's going to take a bit of time. So, yeah, we were just kind of looking for other options really… but we have several admin staff that go into Zendesk and use it all at once. So all in the different areas and the different emails?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So these are like generic email addresses at which you receive queries related to different things and these members are sort of catering to those emails. Understood, how long have you been using Zendesk for?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Since March this year.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, it's nice.

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  We find it more of a, because we're a medical clinic, we find it more of a customer service tool than a.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It is, yeah.

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Yeah, and we used to love outlook, but obviously, I think now we're bigger, we need to kind of sort that a bit easier. We can't go back to outlook again.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. And how many people do you have who are logging into Zendesk today and managing these tickets on a day to day basis?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  About 10.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. 10 people and how many email addresses do you have? Like the different email addresses on which you receive emails?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  It would be just… have a look… one, two, three.

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Three, four, four, potentially five.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Four to five that's not a problem. Perfect. So, yeah, I think Zendesk although it's a great tool in terms of what they offer and what they're doing. But of course, like you mentioned, Zendesk is like a proper ticketing tool, right? Which is helpful for support related or support teams who are always on those emails and, you know, working on those tickets, opening them, closing them. And all of that, hiver does have the interface, which relates a lot with your outlook. And as you were working on outlook, you can connect your personal inbox as well. While you're handling these inboxes, the only thing that I would see as a, you know, potential roadblock here is within hiver, we support two, you know, email providers. We have two products as well. One is for Google workspace that resides right within your Gmail itself. So hiver works as an extension and you can manage your shared mailboxes within your Gmail. And that's where we support different channels, like email is one and then live chat, whatsapp and phone. But for the Microsoft or for any other email provider, we have a different solution called hiver, Omni, wherein we currently only support email, right? So you can definitely create shared mailboxes and work on those emails. But unfortunately, we would not be able to help you setting your whatsapp or connect your phone. So I don't want to waste your time here. So I just want to understand if that is a must have for you, because if it is, then you might want to look at some other platform or if you're just looking at email as of now and can wait till the other channels come in, happy to explore. What do you think?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  So, you're saying that you can only do phone and whatsapp through if we were on a Google platform rather than outlook.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That is true. Okay?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  So that might be a potential because we do have Google emails. So it might be potential that we could change them over to be Google emails rather than outlook.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. But primarily you're hosted on Microsoft, right? So all these email addresses that you just mentioned or for the people who will be using it, they all have the outlook accounts only, right?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Some of us, do, some of us have Google ones as well, but it's something within the business, right? The majority of the business work off of Google platform, but we work off of outlook. So there is a potential that we could move over to Google if that was the only option?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, if that is something that you can consider, then definitely, we can explore hiver, but just to make it clear at a time, it's ideal to be on one either on Microsoft or on Google. The reason being, then if I am part of or I am part of this, one of the shared mailbox that I need to handle and whatsapp resides in Gmail. And then my outlook is in hiver only, then I'll be switching between two platforms back and forth, which is not the ideal situation, right?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Yeah. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  If you can, but just to confirm these different email addresses, the generic ones, these are on outlook, right? These are outlook email addresses only, right?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  At the moment, yeah, but we could get them switched over.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. No problem. Then you could do that. And in terms of the phone, who is your calling provider? Like are you connected with Zendesk? And using Zendesk as your calling provider at this point? Is that how it is?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  We are. Yeah, it's been integrated into Zendesk.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Our number. Okay. Got it. So in hiver, let me just show you as well while we are just talking here so that it gives you a better understanding. So this is how our Gmail product looks like. So as you can see, I'm logged into my Gmail account, and I have embedded hiver that you can see in these yellow colored buttons, right? So currently, I have all the shared mailboxes here along with it. I have my phone as well. If I just refresh this, I'll have my whatsapp and live chat. So all these channels we are able to sort of access and work on in one place itself, right? So this is the whatsapp that you can connect. And then you have the phone as well. Now for the email, it's going to work as similar to Zendesk as how they're doing. The only difference that the team will face is going to be that they're no longer using a separate interface while managing all the emails from their Gmail itself, right? So they can manage their personal emails here and from the shared mailbox. Let's say I pick the support one. From here, they can manage these emails, can collaborate on these assign between themselves, like everything that they're basically doing in Zendesk, right? So that would be for your shared mailboxes, we can connect all these four that you have, and add the relevant team members into that. For whatsapp, this is something that you will be facing or you will have as a condition all across the platforms is I want to understand whatsapp are you looking to integrate just for the purpose of handling the incoming messages on a day to day basis?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Yeah. I mean we do go backwards and forwards to the patients. So we would be sending messages backwards and forwards to them.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So see whenever you connect your whatsapp on a third party platform, these are the settings that meta has wherein you can handle all the incoming messages. Whoever is initiating a chat on this number will come here in this section and then across the team, anybody can pick that up. The interface is going to look something like this. Let me just show you. So from here, you can assign those messages to anyone. And then multiple people are basically working on these messages, right? The only caveat that you will be having here is you cannot initiate any chat from your site. So all the chats are going to remain there for like 24 hours after that, you cannot initiate a chat from your end. So that is going to be there. So it's going to, if you want to use whatsapp, it's only going to be for you to handle the incoming traffic or incoming messages. If somebody is writing to you and being distributed, you know, between the team members. So that's going to be there in whatsapp, but you can definitely connect. It. Is that something that works for you or what do you think?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  I think we, I think we need to be able to initiate messages as well. That's something that we would need. Yeah, only a certain amount of users that can use the whatsapp or is it everybody?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no, you can add as many users as you want. So if you are considering moving away from Zendesk for that reason as one of your reasons, then I would just suggest that if you want to initiate a chat as well, then stick to the whatsapp web or the phone that you currently using because it's going to restrict you from initiating any chat from this number and you cannot even have it anywhere else. So if you have it on either Zendesk, or hiver, you cannot have whatsapp on any other place. So you might want to. Okay. Yeah.

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Okay. Thank you. It's worth thinking about.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So this is for the whatsapp and then for phone, of course, you can connect within hiver, but hiver works with Aircall. So Aircall is one of the email providers in the market. So we connect with them. And teams essentially use phone in hiver to be able to receive calls within here in one place itself while you are connected with Aircall. And using that as an email as your calling provider, you don't have to go to Aircall and then sort of use it. Hiver takes care of that. You will be signed into Aircall right here. And then you can sort of make and receive calls within hiver and log it as to who picked it and what went through it. So that is something that you can do. But yes, for calling, there would be a prerequisite for you to first have Aircall as a calling provider since we only connect with that. So that's going to be there for sure. So these would be the channels in case we decide to go with the Google workspace. But if we remain within outlook for now, and if you have so sorry, if you're using outlook itself. So our outlook product looks like this, it's same as Gmail. But as you can see, you can manage your personal inbox here. You can also manage your shared mailboxes. It's just that it won't have your whatsapp and call. So the rest of the things will be the same but.

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Whatsapp and phone, you can't connect. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So if you are sort of looking as an alternative from Zendesk for the fact that it does not, it feels too heavy to use or it's a more of a ticketing tool and you want something simpler, then of course, you can consider us to like hyper because the whole process remains very simple. You have all your shared mailboxes in one place, you can easily assign these emails between yourselves, track the progress on whether it's open it's pending or closed. You can create those tags to categorize your emails as well. You can use templates when you're responding to emails, so all of those things are going to be available here for you. Okay?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Thank you. Do you have anything else Vivian to ask?

Vivian Liu (vivian@manual.co):
  I just want to ask a little bit around pricing. What does that look like? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Sure. Let me just show you that. So, in terms of the pricing, we have different tiers of plans that we offer. This is for the annual subscription that you're looking at. So we have a starter plan which is growth that's that stands for 25 dollars per user per month. So, based on the functionalities that you need, we would be making that decision as to, you know, which plan will suffice.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But understanding that you are a clinic and you wouldn't really require that heavy functionalities, of a support team, then maybe, you know, growth plan could suffice your needs. Okay? Yeah.

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Okay. Thank you. Well, yeah, I don't have any more questions. Thank you for showing us around. Yeah, that's really good. Thank you. And we'll have a talk about it and I think, and see what the best route to go down is.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me know. Like if you wish to sort of continue, no worries at all. But, yeah… I mean, lovely. Yeah, just wanted to, you know, let you know and be transparent because of course, as you're evaluating or seeing looking for an alternative, you should be knowing all things in advance. So going forward, if you decide to just stick to email or moving to Google workspace, any of those things, let me know, and then we can connect at that point and take the evaluation forward. Okay?

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Perfect. Thank you very much for your time. Thank.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You take care. Bye bye.

Susie Strange (susie@menopausecare.co.uk):
  Bye.
