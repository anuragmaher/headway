================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Jose, can you hear me?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hello?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Yes. Hello. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hi, I'm doing good. How's it going for you?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Oh, good. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right, Jose, pleasure meeting you. I'm Raghav with the account management team here at hiver. I'm going to be working with you on the exploring the AI feature set on hiver and how that's going to be useful for your team.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. So, Jose, heading into the call, I did have a chance to check out your hiver setup. I noticed that you've got a couple of inboxes one of that seems to be support if you don't mind, could you give me like a brief 30 seconds in terms of how you're using hiver as of today with your team?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Yeah. So we're using it mostly for communication with the customers. So, all the new customers that want to request a quote… if I'm not sure they send an email to info at… idsupply, com MX. No, it's to ventas, that it's sales in Spanish.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  And then they are distributed by an admin service to the different sales persons. I think there are four in the office.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  So, I think that's mostly what we're using it for.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. And within your hiver account, I didn't really notice like a lot of workflows or like a lot of tagging and things like that. Could you tell me what that looks like? Like? Do you run categories? Would you like to classify these emails a certain way?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  So, I'm not sure. I think we should start using more of that capabilities of the system. I think that what we could do is maybe divide them in new customers on… customers that we have already quoted, and we need to follow up in some way. I'm not really sure. I need to think a little bit more about it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure, that makes sense. So the reason why I asked that question is because the way we're shaping up the AI features on hiver, there's three key pillars that hiver's AI can handle as of today. And with our existing roadmap that's going to be, you know, ever evolving in the next couple of weeks, we're going to be launching one more AI feature as well. So long story short, when it comes to the hiver AI feature set, you know, let me share my screen as well for like a quick visual and what I'm talking about. So hiver is being useful for your team in two perspectives, right? One is from an AI agent route and that's more along the operational lines, right? Where AI can tag your conversations and categorize it. You've got sentiment analysis as an additional aspect. And then on the co, pilot route is where you get a more interactive AI, you know, version of hiver where you can effectively ask it questions. It can draft responses for you that your team can just send in one click, things like that.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay. All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, yeah. So when it comes to your incoming conversations, you did say that you'd want to categorize it, I know the existing versus new customers that's not data that hiver has access to readily as I'm sure you were. So what you can instead, you know, consider is maybe having these AI tagging run as categories, you know, the type of issue, the nature of the request, things like that could all be categorized by hiver automatically, when you start receiving these emails?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay. And whenever we start tagging after the conversation, what happens so we can assign it to different people or what can be done after the tagging has been completed?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's a great question. So, after the tagging has been completed, you have a whole range of options that you can choose from. So let's say you're using AI to add the tags, what you can do is you can either say, hey, if the tag is one two three, right? You can be very specific and you can be like, L, one escalation, urgent issue, and, you know, maybe L3 escalation, high priority, right? So depending on the type of inquiry that you're receiving that the AI is capturing and tagging, you can do any number of actions. It could be assigning it to one person in the team, assigning between a smaller group of people, adding a follower who gets updates but is not directly assigned to that email, sending a custom reply for that one situation, reassigning it to a different person sending a hiver notification, updating fields on hiver that you can have for additional mechanisms, all of this.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Wow. Okay. Yeah, that's good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And another example that you said, right? Which was, I want to figure out how to track replies and everything that's happening. We've got an option for that. It can be like, hey, if there's no reply from the customer on my emails and, you know, let's say there's been 24 hours since an external reply was received during business hours, that's basically what three days of working. So, if there's no reply from the client in three days and your team has done the last action which is send out a message to them, you can be like, hey hiver. In this case, I want you to automate a follow up, going out again, situation specific scenario specific. It can be like, hey, there we've written to you. We're waiting to hear back from you on X y and Z. Could you let us know when you have the time to get back to the details? So you can even automate it to that extent?

S Notetaker:
  Okay. That's cool. And.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  For example, if we sent a quote, can this automation resend the quote or like using a forward instead of a reply? So the attachment is not lost?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Again, it depends on how we'll be setting it up because a lot of this will rely on you being able to tell hiver hey this is a code sent scenario, right? Or you can basically again if we're relying on tags that's an option, we've got dropdown custom fields that you can use. Again, it all builds on how we're setting it up. So for instance, we can be like to your scenario. We can be like if I'm updating code sent as a dropdown, right? And if the dropdown option for code sent is yes, and… no reply from the client has been received in again, three days of business hours, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, then you can have hiver send again, send a reply, right? Which becomes another reply. If you want hiver to do something else in terms of, you know, adding a note, triggering an approval flow, things like that can be done too. It can't necessarily send a new email from scratch, but it can definitely bump up the same thread so that the quote is not lost. The attachment always shows up in Gmail at the top. You know, even in a thread that attachment is going to stand out. So that way you're not going to lose out on the quote, but you still have the email bumped to the inbox, top of the inbox for the client.

S Notetaker:
  Okay. Right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I've been in sales with hiver for like eight years. So I know exactly what you're talking about definitely help.

S Notetaker:
  Okay. All right. And okay.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  And those automations are triggered just by the tagging of the AI or in which part of this automation is AI being involved?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, AI gets involved in the first step of adding the tag, right? As it currently stands with our AI features that would be first step. And then from there, automations can be kicked off based on it as of now quote being sent to. Sounds more like a very user specific action.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So there I'd say send the quote and use a different option to update it. This would be outside of AI. The team just needs to update it manually. And once that's done, the second automation can basically kick off.

S Notetaker:
  Okay. Right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Now, AI being able to automatically generate tasks and do things like that is part of our roadmap for rest of Q4 and all of next year. So it's not completely there to do the whole thing for you just yet. But it can definitely automate the first 40 50 percent of it, which is tagging something as quote.

S Notetaker:
  Okay, right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And, you know, the best part is with every AI, you need to have full control as the business using it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So you have full control on which category or tag you want to use, what situations and scenarios it should be used for with full training control, remove stuff, add more information, just be, very specific on when is an email classified as code sent? When does it mean, you know, refund? When is it an urgent issue? The whole breadth of things?

S Notetaker:
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. So, yeah. So that's, the tagging piece of it now because you work with, on the info side of things, at least, I'm guessing you work with clients directly, you could have a small little emoji show up that tells you, hey, is this customer coming in, with a negative emotion or like a strongly dissatisfied frustrated perspective, are they coming in a more neutral question which is more straightforward or is it somebody who's very happy and just wants to continue that happy conversation they're having, right? Happy experience, grateful experience. Now using the sentiment again, you could automate actions as well. Some of our customers say, hey, if there's a negative sentiment received on an email, I want that email to be escalated to leadership. So that's one of the rules we've got running on my inbox, I assign it to the team lead, add a tag, send a specific email as a reply, that whole side of things.

S Notetaker:
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. And again, if it's a positive connotation, a positive response on the, you know, on the sentiment, you can be like, you know, drop a review link for us or like add an additional, you know, a good note, on the response you're sending again multiple options for you to choose from.

S Notetaker:
  Okay. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's the sentiment piece of it. There's also a fully fledged of reporting that we've built out as well on the backs of sentiments. So you'll also be able to track how many customers came in at what mindset or what sentiment based on AI understanding it, who was handling it, what's the current status, that whole perspective because sentiment is more an ongoing mechanism. So, if your agents are able to convert somebody from like a negative sentiment to a positive, that also becomes part of reporting that you can track.

S Notetaker:
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. And yeah, the next part which is probably going to be, very useful for your team even from day one is going to be the co, pilot piece of it that ties all.

S Notetaker:
  Of this together, right? So that's that sentiment as an?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Example, but the co pilot piece simply basically lets you draft a reply at one click of a button. Now, what happens in the background here is as a business or as a team on hiver, you control the knowledge sources that co pilot is trained on or ask AI is trained on. So it's not going to be generic responses like you see with Google gemini or chatgpt.

S Notetaker:
  For instance, it's.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  going to be very contextual, very driven based on the documents you've uploaded, the knowledge sources you've fed it, or even the knowledge base that you've built out on hiver that acts as your process, your vetting your approach basis, on which ask AI can generate a response. So effectively pump it in with your knowledge sources, process documents, refund policies, sales policies, things like that. And as an agent to the team, I just need to go talk to AI and be like, hey, I want to send a reply. It's going to give you a few scenarios, select a scenario. It's going to create an answer based on the email and the process documents that you've uploaded. So it's going to be a completed version, one click get sent out.

S Notetaker:
  Go to build.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  And does it work in Spanish?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We have tested it for multilingual support and we're pretty confident that it will work for you. Yes. So the text will be in Spanish. It will be able to understand Spanish emails as they are received and give you a response completely written in Spanish based on again processes things.

S Notetaker:
  Like that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And if at any time you feel it needs to be better, you can just tell it like you would with your conversational AI bots on the outside. So refine the answer with more details. For instance, in my case, pop that in, again, it's going to go through my knowledge sources again. And as long as I have that information on a knowledge source, AI is going to be able to fetch that curate a reply from the hiver first approach. And.

S Notetaker:
  Just basically have that ready instead.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  But that's not active yet on my account, right? I need to activate it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Or, oh yeah, you have access to the features as part of the trial. So we've basically offered all of our customers beta trial for the AI features, but it's not enabled. So for you to enable it, I'd say, go to your hiver logo, admin panel.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  And.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  then you're going to see hiver AI on the left side?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Yes, click.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  On that… go to AI copilot. Okay? And that's your slider and then knowledge sources below that for the documents and snippets you want to upload.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Publish and refine your responses by improving grammar. Okay. So, the AI compose is similar to the one that Gmail already has.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. The one that Gmail already has, the one that gemini has grammarly used to do this for a living before. It's pretty similar in that sense of it. The difference again is that gemini chatgpt, any AI agent you might be thinking about right outside of Gmail, they're mostly purpose, not purpose built. They're more generic and they serve one size fits all angle with the hiver route. Every AI feature we launch, we're taking it more from a customer support a hiver team first.

S Notetaker:
  Perspective.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So that way it's going to be a little more contextual, a little more detail oriented and more useful. But yeah, to answer your question, if you look at it just like that, it's pretty similar.

S Notetaker:
  To what you get with gemini just to put that in context.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  And how back does it go? For example, I'm looking here at an email where a customer is sharing with us the payment for a quote that we sent inside the quote, we have the delivery days, the delivery days… but on the customer reply, he only sent his payment confirmation. So, is there any way of the AI looking at the complete thread and answering back, confirming… delivery date and acknowledging payment?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, definitely. So, AI at this stage will not be able to go through attachments. So we've intentionally kept it from being able to read through attachments because quite honestly, we haven't heard from a lot of our customers on the need to track attachments just yet. It is something that we've started getting increasing requests for. So we're looking at the best way of handling it. So to answer your question, it will be able to go through the entire email chain as it exists, email body subject from addresses and all of that. Excuse me, if it's attachments that's probably something that will build down the line. I can take it as a feature request.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, yeah. So that's what that set of the things would look like. So on the AI front, you know, obviously summarizer and everything aside there's also, you know, the AI writing assistant here, so that's the compose in terms of making it easier, better, fixing grammar and all that stuff. And we've also got AI QA coming up by next week. That's going to give admins a way to control and track how the team is performing on like completeness of the reply tonality, verbiage, a lot of that stuff as well.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  And which is the pricing for this?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, the AI add on as a whole feature suite including all of these features is bundled into a 20 usd per person per month, add on bundle, right at the bottom here, right? And if you notice AI suggested response is going to be coming out really soon. AI answers and AI tasks are all three things that will be launched before the end of this year.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  And really soon, how soon?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Before the end of this year basically?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So over the next one, one and a half months, you should have or rather start seeing these coming soon features on my screen.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Now, a couple of things, Jose now, I did want to mention this as well because I checked your account in the back end and noticed that you're on our monthly plan and on lite, which is something we no longer offer. I'm sure we're reaching out to our customers and faces, but now that I have you, I did want to check if you're open to considering an annual contract with hiver as opposed to a monthly contract.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  How much am I paying now per month per user?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let me quickly double check that. Yep, thought I had it ready, but I can't find it. So just give me one quick second. It should.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Be here right on my admin panel, maybe.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, you should be able to see it in admin panel accounts. You should see it right there.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Accounts. I don't see the accounts?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You're at ust per person per month on the lite on the monthly version?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay. Which are the new ones?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sorry?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  And which are the new options that you have? Oh, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. So we've got growth pro and elite 25 45 75 on the annual. But if you're open to switching to annual, I can keep you at 24 on the growth, give you the annual plan, same cost, no cost increase. You should get the growth plan instead of the lite plan.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  And which is the extra that I get on the growth plan?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  That I don't have right now on the lite.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. Sure. So as per the lite plan, you had reduced limits basically on all of these, you know, lite gives you one inbox. Typically growth gives you three. I think the sales team might have given you an extra addition on the two mailboxes that you currently have. Growth will give you one extra mailbox, you're going to have five extra rules. Lite puts you at 10 automation rules. You get 15 on growth. Lite, gives you two custom fields. You can have five on growth. And again, slas is something that you don't have on lite or you have access to only one growth, gives you two of those, you get reporting that's better and more detailed on growth, right? So, you get to create custom reports, you get to track user data, tag data and conversation data. So email volume, agent wise handling categories are all things you get on the growth plan. So these are all going to be additional stuff that you didn't have access to on lite.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay. How many users do I have right now?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You have about nine people. Last, I checked just quickly pull that up. Yeah, you're being billed for nine monthly users. As of the last renewal, October eleventh.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  I'm having an issue with my… email inbox because.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Since.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  I'm not sure what's wrong, but I'm the admin and all the outgoing emails are going out from my inbox and they always stay as open. If I, on my Gmail app, if you want to see my unread emails, I get like many thousands of emails when I try to filter by unread because of all the outgoing emails, can this be fixed?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, definitely. If you don't mind Jose, can you share your screen there's? A couple of options I'd like for you to enable, should help you sort that out.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Sure.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  So, for example, here, if I go to my sent email.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  have all the sent emails from everyone?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Are you looking at my screen right now? Yes?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I can see your screen just came up.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. Got it. So, what you're talking about, is this one right? All sent versus my sent? Can you click on my sent there on the top of your screen over here?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just want to see. Yeah. So can you click on this one that says, go to my settings, small little change. Yeah, just enable the slider here, then save it when ready. Okay, save and enable. So this.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Is only for me, right? Not for everyone, not.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For everybody, this is a personal setting and everybody has to enable it separately.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So what you've essentially done is you've given or told hiver to split the sent emails. So now, it's not going to be one huge list of every reply the team sends, but instead replies that you send versus every reply that goes out to the mailbox.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Right. But that's only when the hiver.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah… that's only when the hiver Chrome extension is up and running. This is on the browser. Now, for the mobile experience, what I'd suggest is check out the hiver mobile application instead of the standard Gmail application, right? Because we bring you both your private emails or direct emails along with the shared mailbox emails inside of there. And I think tracking it using the hiver mobile application would probably give you a better experience as well.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay. Let me try it. I tried using it before when we first got the solution but I didn't like it. I'm not sure if something has changed.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We've made quite a lot of changes since 20 24 when you joined us.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, I'm positive you'll like it because in the last three months, a lot of our customers have started actively adopting it and find that pretty useful. We've added more features there, more controls and better notifications. So do give it a shot. See if that helps. Now, the second thing I wanted to ask you Jose, was you said that the emails are going out from your account? Was that just that you were able to see everybody's emails and like the sent folder in Gmail, is that what you were able to do? That's it all right? So, for.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  example, if I go here to my inbox and I filter by unread. So… I have just 113 emails and look what happens. I get all the responses. We want this unread.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, it's very.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Hard for me to finish my unread emails.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, that's a simple fix. So effectively, what you're doing is just give it a little bit of background here. Gmail search that you just did when you do it by label, it's pretty much going to run it across every email in your account. And because hiver now brings all of your shared emails into your account, that's exactly why when you do label unread, you're getting everything, what I'd suggest is when you do label unread space, label inbox on the search. And that's just your inbox emails that are unread. Excuse me. Yeah, that's the one. So that's just your emails that are unread.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay. Yeah, these work.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So that should be a quick way it was.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  horrible every time I tried to do it before.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You're good, Jose, it's just, it took me a while, eight years at hiver. I'm still learning new things on Gmail search. So you're good man. Okay. Thank you for sure. And so, yeah, I mean, outside of this, was there anything else about hiver that you wanted to chat about? Anything you wanted to explore?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  No, I don't think so. Let me try using the AI. I will get a call with my team and get them to test it. So we have 45 days, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Can you do me a favor? Because some of our customers are seeing wrong numbers, can you click on the hiver? AI? All right. Looks like that's a bit of a mismatch.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So as it stands right now, we're offering all of our customers trial till the end of November, which is basically 20 seventh. So that's like a two week period. We can definitely extend that trial period if we need more time. So, do you think a two week trial will be sufficient? Or do you think you probably need maybe like a week or two more?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  We're a bit slow whenever we're getting changes on the process. So I think we will start testing it maybe in a few weeks, got it. Yeah, all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  right. So.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  If you get a little bit extra, that would be good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood. So then, Jose, what I'll do is I'll probably work with my team and ensure that your trial stays active till like the 20 second of December, effectively a month, give or take, you know, a month and a week extra. And, you know, we can probably touch base the second week of December, the week of tenth or eleventh of December, you can tell me how the testing is coming around. If you needed another call, talk about any new AI features that we will have ready by then. And if it makes sense, we can look at the contract and pretty much include it based on how you'd like to proceed.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay. Yeah, it looks good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. And Jose, from today till that time, when we meet next, if you have any questions doubts, AI or otherwise, feel free to drop me an email and I'll either get back to you directly or I'll put you in touch with the right person who can get a response, clarity out to you.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. Jose, pleasure chatting with you. Hope you have a good day. Check out the hiver mobile app, and I'll circle back on the second week of December to see if AI is of interest from a commercial angle?

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Sure. Can you send me the recording for this meeting?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely, definitely. And also Jose, when I do reach out in December, I'll also be looking at, you know, the transition to the growth plan as well just to align on the tier. And from now till the end of December, I'm happy to offer growth at the same price on an annual contract with the extra limits on all the features. Yep. Okay.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  Sounds good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right, Jose. Cheers, man. Have a good day. Thank you. Thank.

Jose Garza (jgarza@180devex.com):
  You. Bye.
