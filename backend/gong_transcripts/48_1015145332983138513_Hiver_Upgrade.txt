Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  hey, hi, Raghav. I'm sorry, I was disturbed.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. You're good. Yeah, jayantika. What can I help you with?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  So, sorry. So basically what I had a talk with my administration, they just wanted to ask that, for example, right now, I have a seat. Let's say for me, like I can add users, I am the admin and I can, you know, increase the number of users. I just wanted to ask. Basically, is there a possibility that, you know, somebody like from sales, they, you know, become like a seat or whatever? And then they can get, you know, three, sorry, they can get another elite growth plan and then can add like three more shared inboxes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Wait, I'm a little confused. So, could… you repeat the question? I'm sorry, I don't think I understood that fully.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  No problem. So, let's just say, for example, like I started with hiver, right? I am adding users, the billing is under my name. So let's say I have, and for me, I have three shared mailboxes, right? Is there a possibility where we can have another seat? Let's say the sales team is another seat and they become the billing people for that seat and they can get another three shared mailboxes under the growth plan.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that won't be possible. So, you know, from, if everybody's on like the same company, then we would technically require everybody to be on the same account or the same subscription basically.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Okay. There is no other alternative for this.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Not at the moment, you know, looking from a cost saving perspective, this would be the best route in terms of just consolidating everybody and then upgrading accordingly based on like the discount pricing and everything would be the best route to go about it.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Okay. In terms of pricing, you're saying this would be best.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. In terms of just getting a better discount at the end of the day, I think the offer that I've rolled out would probably be the easiest bet to ensure overall, you know, you don't split up and end up paying more basically.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Okay. And one thing I had that since we were discussing the monthly subscription thing, also, what is the monthly breakdown? Could you tell me?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, sure. So the way I was looking at it was have you on an annual contract and have your payments happening month on month? Okay. Right? So that would mean that, you know, with the 25 percent discount and everything we've rolled out the elite annual plan for you at around 55 or 56 dollars to be precise, right? So, yeah, 56 per person. So, for like 30 people that's approximately 1,600 per month? Okay?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  1,600 per.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  person? Yeah, 1,687 to be precise per month, right? So, normally, what we do is we'd put it on an annual contract and bid you for like 20,000 dollars in one shot. Yeah. The suggestion that I offered or like the alternative that I offered was basically have you pay this 1,600 every month as a monthly invoice, as opposed to one invoice of 20,000 dollars. Right? And the only reason I'm suggesting this is because the, I mean the monthly version of the plan in itself is 95 dollars. It's not even 75 to begin with, right? And, you know, even if I'm able to get like an extra five percent and round you out at 30 percent discount on monthly, that's still going to put you at 66 dollars per month per person. So, you're looking at a 2000 dollar bill per month instead of the 1,600 with the new contract. Yeah.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  But essentially, you're saying that right now it would be like if we go with the elite plan, then it would be a 1,683 per month.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, it'll be. So, what I've offered you is a 25 percent discount on the total. So just to give you exact numbers, it's going to be 56 point two five per person per month. For a team of 30. It's going to be 1,687 point five excluding the taxes and stuff. So, yeah.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  OK. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, but yeah, to answer your question, to summarize it and answer your question, yes, you are looking at around 1,600 1,700 as a monthly invoice. And you'll be contracted for like a 12 month period where you make this 1,700 payment every single month instead of a 20,000 dollar single payment.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Okay. That's just the only question basically just wanted to have that considering we just wanted to, you know, look at the growth plan itself because rest of the things are pretty solid for us like under the growth plan, whatever automations we have there that slas, we have the AI integration thing that we have. All of that is working fine for us. And probably this is the only thing that we require except for the other three shared mailboxes. So that was the only reason why we wanted to upgrade. Otherwise upgrade is not necessarily needed also.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I understood. And that's why I had that discussion with leadership and unlocked, the discount we usually give like 75 to 100 people is when we give like more than 20 percent discount, like more than 15 percent to be precise at 50 users is when we start unlocking that 10 percent, 15 percent percentage, right? And that's pretty much how it goes. So, I heard you. I, I'm aware of to the level of which you're using hiver so far. Yeah. I also understand the growth potential, right? You're going from like basically tripling your user count in two, two and a half months, or so, right? So that's where I came in from in terms of having the discount already approved with leadership and also getting approval on offering as a monthly invoice on an annual contract. Yeah.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  All right. I will just have another talk with the management and I will just give you a confirmation.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  I understand that it would be best if we do it by before 20 first of November. So I'll be aiming for that, but let's just have another call with them. Probably by tomorrow, I would have an answer clearer answer, at least sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. Yeah. So.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Tell me something… considering I think our billing date is somewhere around eighteenth of November.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  So once let's say this gets upgraded, would it be counted as the date we make the payment or would it be the previous date?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That, you know, pretty much depends. So what I can do is we can either seventeenth is realistically possible, then we can work towards that date and, you know, we can have everything wrapped up and it just renews on that date.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  I mean, we don't really have a problem if it's the mid of the month or if it's the end of the month. I was curious. So I just thought I'd ask, yeah, sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So general practice, what we do is if after the renewal date, something like this happens, we'll just do a prorated adjustment for what the remaining is and then have the upgrade done. So the renewal date doesn't change as such all.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Right. All right. But if.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  you prefer the renewal date to be on like, you know, 20 first against which we're working then I can have that done as well. It's not too much of a thing, okay?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Sure. Sorted.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Jayantika. All right. Thanks for hopping on if you have any other questions or if there's any other clarifications needed, I'm.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  really glad we can, you know, catch up this quick this often, definitely. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, perfect. Thank you. Have a good day.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Bye. Yeah, you too. Have a good weekend as well cheers.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thank you.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Bye.
