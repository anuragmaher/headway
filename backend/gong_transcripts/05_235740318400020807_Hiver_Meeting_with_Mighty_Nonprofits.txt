Call: Hiver Meeting with Mighty Nonprofits
Date: 2025-11-15T01:29:49+05:30
================================================================================

Vanessa Alonzo (vanessa@mightynonprofits.com):
  hello, Matthew?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, Vanessa. How you doing?

Vanessa Alonzo (vanessa@mightynonprofits.com):
  I'm doing great and you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Doing good, you know, it's Friday.

Vanessa Alonzo (vanessa@mightynonprofits.com):
  Friday. It's not a coincidence. How we're feeling? Yes, I know. Yo.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yo. All right.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. I got one more joining on my end as promised. Let's see if he's.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  perfect. Well, I appreciate you both joining here. As I said, especially on a Friday, I've looped in my manager Jeevan here just to be an additional resource to help with any outstanding questions you might have over since our last call. So just so that he can address it. And then, yeah, I mean, the agenda here, just wanted to quickly recap our conversation and I'm going to pass it over to you both here to see what other questions have come up.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But basically, right? You're just using Google groups for managing your client communications. You have a different group for each one of your clients. And basically with hiver, we could streamline that process by transforming your groups into a fully managed help desk directly within Gmail.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, great. And we're trying to figure out what that structure might look like, right? And how it would work? How we would separate our teams around that have different views around that. Do we do away with Google groups and just do like one main contact? And if we did that, would we be able to create enough rules to then segregate right? More like a typical shared inbox. So just unclear about what it would look like in hiver. Still.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, thanks, Joe. My name is Jeevan. Like matt said, I lead the sales team here at hiver. However, I've also been at the business for about seven years. In my previous roles. I've worked with a lot of our larger companies and a lot of them do happen to be very similar bookkeeping, accounting firms, cloud accounting firms out there. So, very familiar with the model, very familiar with the kind of work that you all do. So long story short, Joe, there, is it's… up to you and how your team is structured. But there is a lot that hiver can do, right? So in terms of the structure, the abilities, the rules that we can have, the way we can structure it. I'm going to talk through that in the next couple of minutes. Anything else that you typically want to address or is the structure the final piece, sort of big item that you want to sort of get through?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah. I mean, we want to understand the full capabilities of it too, right? We're comparing Hubspot… as one of the other ones that we're looking at, right? We're also looking at Zendesk as another option, right? Helpscout, front, different… right? Hiver is very different than those because of the native integration into Gmail, that's right? We want to try and see how it's a little harder to compare apples to apples here. We're trying to get a sense of that cost is a big issue for us. So we're also trying to see what can we do without like having to upgrade to the super expensive plans, right?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. And so matt and I, we spoke about that. We spoke about how you want to go to the, you might only need the larger plan only for in terms of number of mailboxes. And like I said, we don't want that if we go through all of this effort and tick all your boxes, we don't want that to be a stumbling box. So we definitely are happy to work with you on pricing. Yeah. And you're absolutely right? I know you mentioned the four of the four competitor names there and having been in the space for a while, we're very familiar with those names. Yeah. And I completely understand why you think that it's hard to do an apples to apples comparison. It is hard, but my objective here is to actually show you how it could be an apples to apples and still work within the confines of what you could do, right? Yeah. So I want to set some context. I know you, Vanessa and yourself saw like maybe a brief demo with matt and we can sort of dig a little deeper. I'm not going to go through the basic functionality unless you have any questions, but I want to dig a little deeper into how some of our other customers have set up similar structures. Yeah. So Joe with hiver as, you know, each person logs into their own individual inbox, how you're doing right now? Unlike a third party system, you don't need to go to another software. We're not connecting your groups to a different software. We're not converting them to tickets or anything like that. We're leaving them in your inbox, leaving them as emails and we're bringing functionality to it. So what you're going to see on your end, Joe and Vanessa is you're going to have a list of emails or folders like these on the left right now, technically one folder can connect to one group email address, right? So that's the typical sort of like run of the mill setup. What we can do and what we have done very successfully in the past is help you figure out a structure that makes sense for your team. Now, if you want all of your, matt, you mentioned 75 groups give or take.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right? 75 is a good number. So you want to have 75 groups. What we don't recommend is having 75 individual folders over there that's not going to work, right? No. So what we can help you do and I can literally walk you through every step of this. We can either help you combine all of them into one central account or one central folder. And we do have the rules and the automations and the structuring within it to make that happen. Or what a lot of other customers also do is sort of go to a pod structure so that it just makes it slightly easier to scale where instead of you having 75, you maybe have five or maybe 10 and you group a bunch of them in like 10 groups into 110 groups into one, right? I would leave that up to you because what that depends on is how your team internally, matt mentioned you have about 13 to 15 people. Do you have them, all 13 to 15 of them looking after all of these groups or are there situations where they focus on certain sections?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah. Every bookkeeper has a set of clients, maybe five to 10 clients and then they change too. Sometimes they'll change to that client, change to that client. So, yeah, we need that functionality to be able to switch to like, hey, oh, now you're in charge of this one. Now you're in charge of that one?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. So the first thing that we'd love you to do is give us that mapping, right? And the way we can help you get it from you, is there's something called a custom object where it's literally a table that you can give us. I'm going to give you an example of what that looks like. So on our end, this is a mapping that you can give us. These are as you can tell, it's just about importing a new version of this and it can get automatically updated easy right now once you've given this to us and, you know, which bookkeeper is in charge of which accounts. You actually can set up a situation where each… of them, you can combine all of these groups into one shared inbox into one. Like I said, you can break it down further. But for the sake of this example, let's say you're going to consolidate everything into one folder. And for the sake of this call, you assume that that's support on my screen?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  When.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  an email comes into support. What we are looking for, right? Is we are looking for Joe, the ability to detect the email address that it was either sent to or it was sent from. So you can base it on either. So I'm going to just go in and build a rule like this, right? So let's say, for example, it's a really simple rule. Once you've given us that table, you can say, whenever a new conversation is received in this one central mailbox, you can tell hiver that if that email comes in from a particular client, right? And that client is present in the mapping or the object that you gave us, right? So in my case, I'm going to say the from email is present in client, you can automatically go in and assign it to. You. Don't have to keep mentioning, you can just go in and say the owner of the client simple structure. But since you've given us the association already, we can help you set it up and we can help you route it and it will always get routed to the right person.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, exactly. And this is similar to what we're looking at with the other shared inbox softwares, right? Some sort of automation so that everything associated with that client goes to the right space with this functionality here. Right here. You have it like… sometimes a client, there might be six or seven people right within that company. Sometimes they all have the same domain. Sometimes they don't sometimes it's some other individual email, right? A personal email. And so, is there a way where we can just connect contacts to a particular client even if they have the domain or not.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can absolutely. So you can either just mention it in that mapping that you give us or we can also sort of like create a rule that says this domain is connected to this major client and you continue to work with them? We can definitely do that.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Well, I want to drill into that a little bit because we've been having some troubles with the test drives of some other software where it's not that easy to do. And this is a big issue for us. Okay? What we don't want is like 100 unassigned emails, every day, right? So let's say I have a client and two of the people that work there, they have the domain, but then there's two board members. They don't use the domain. They use their own contacts. I want to make sure that they're included in those rules so that it's automatically sorted and assigned for that company.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. So what you can do is you can mention those instances in our mapping and you give that to us. So tell us more.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  About what that means the mapping and giving it to you, are you guys doing programming on the back end?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No, no, no. So essentially, it's like sort of ingesting an excel sheet of sorts in product. We're not doing anything manually. It's in product. You can ingest an excel sheet. So what we'd ask from you is maybe a three column excel sheet, right? We'd say, hey, client name all the email addresses associated with the client if required, and then goes to the owner, the person internally that is in charge of managing that client and then how?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Would we edit that at any point in time? Let's say they get another person associated with that client?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. All you need to do is go into that one main excel sheet on your end, make the edit whenever it's required, download a version of that. And all you need to do is import new data.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  So I can't just go to the client within hiver and add an email. I have to be doing this download upload thing… because that's where problems happen, right?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, the only issue like you said, the only issue for us is because they're not in the same domain. If they were on the same domain, you could do that because they're not in the same domain. We'd have to know on some level where that association is. And for us, the easiest way for our automations to sort of pick that up is in the custom object.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  And there's no way to edit the custom objects on your website. It has to be uploaded through an excel sheet.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It is originally in an excel sheet. Let me just quickly give… me a second.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You would have to do that. This different domain piece. Joe, just leave that with me for just for the time being. I will check with my team on whether there's an easier way for us to do this, and I will get back to you.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Because it's common and that's why I'm asking, right? So we deal with nonprofits, they have a lot of board members, right? So the board members don't have their own emails with the domain and they're changing board members often. So we're constantly doing this, right? So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  They would just have an at Gmail. Com account or some other domain. Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Something or AOL or who knows,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  right. Sure. No, I'm asking whether it's going to absolutely, there's no way for us to predict, but I'm asking whether the likelihood of that being an actual business domain versus an AOL or yahoo. Com or Google.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  It's all over the map. Sometimes there'll be some other company that they're associated with because they're just volunteers, right?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. I figured, I just wanted to clarify. All right, leave that with me. I will see what the best way to do that. So, can you walk me through and what an ideal picture would look like? The ideal picture is you have a company, you have an account where you can go in and say this account is managed by this user or this person on your team. And while all of the members in that account will have emails with that domain, here are two more people who don't have emails with that domain who are also connected to this account that need to be automatically assigned to that person.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah. And then in addition to that, maybe there's some random emails from like a big corporate like a bank or something and they might be associated with a bunch of different clients, but we just want to be able to tag individual emails too to make sure those get routed. But that might just be manually right from the unassigned. I know we can assign, but would we be able to like just associate it with that client so that it automatically then gets routed and follows all those options?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So you can definitely tag it right here. It's just a super simple process. It's a dropdown where you can tag it. Of course, this is mostly done either automatically or it is done via AI. You can actually say, hey, these are the five tags that we need go into your backend. And you can train our AI to pick up on categories that match these five tags. And then our AI will process all of your emails. If required. Again, you don't have to do it.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, because I just want to associate it to the company or the client. Can I associate it to a client from here?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So there are a couple of different ways in which you can do that. You can either create a tag for each client. And if you have a finite set of clients and it's not going to be sort of like an ever, like a rapid even if it's a rapidly growing risk, it's fine. However we want to take it one step further. Like I said, we work with a lot of finance teams and some of the things that they've requested for is this linked conversations button. But if you think that this email from a bank is related to this specific case from a client, you can actually go in and link two conversations together and you can search for them. You can link them so that from there's, always a like a permanent link between those two threads.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Sure. So, and we've come across this with some of the other software too. As far as the tags go… we're going to be using tags for other things, right? Not just the clients like accounts payable or accounts receivable, or some of the other features that's kind of how we plan on using tags. We also have tags for every company file or every company, or every client, right? We're going to end up with 100 or more tags. So is there, can you walk me through the functionality of tags? Do you, are you able to nest a hierarchy of tags, have a parent tag and sub tags? Are you able to add a bunch of tags all at once? Or is it just like more general?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, yeah. So we've tried to keep our tagging structure very like sort of flat. So there is no nesting and the reason why that is because of the way we filter. So if you look at our filtering structure, you can go in and go into each tags. Okay? I'm inside tags, I want to go somewhere else. Wait, yeah, here we go. So I can go into our filter structure here and build based on it contains all of these tags or it does not contain any of these tags. So for that structure, we've kept it flat in terms of creation. You can create them one by one over here. You can also create them in by giving us a list of tags that you might need and we can feed that in on the back end and create them for you. But the thing, the reason why we've kept them one by one is because we also give you the ability to explain to hiver, what that tag is meant for and what it's not meant for, so that our AI can learn from it and start tagging it for you.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Which is why it's one by one but you can also give us a list if you want and we can create it.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I want to go back and just sort of like focus on one particular workflow that just run you through to see whether that might help or just like be relevant at all. So, this is something that comes up all the time. So, let's say you have 75 different tags for 75 different clients, right? And let's say one of your clients is Adidas. And I'm going to create a tag for Adidas. And I'm going to say use this tag for all emails from clients using Adidas. Com. So literally, I've given it an explanation. So our AI will be able to pick it up. Now, I've created a tag for Adidas. Com. What I can do here is I can go into our automations, click our automations and say, create from scratch and say, when a new conversation is received, if that email comes in from someone from Adidas com or here's, the idea I had, right? Even if the person on the other end, in your case, there may be the CEOS of companies who might know or the board members, sorry, they might not have email addresses with their domain, would they still be sending emails to that dedicated group for that particular client?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Well, if we switch to I guess a more shared inbox where not every group has its own folder, right? Then what we would probably want to do is not, right? We would probably want to just create a single inbox.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Not necessarily.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  The reason being, is we're going to be responding from here, right? And so, the response, I don't think it's going to, are you guys able to make it come from a group depending on which client folder, exactly.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly, right. So just bear with me for one second. So let's say we keep your current structure, right? Which is 75 inboxes. So your clients, the board members, they don't change the way they're communicating with you. They continue to use individual inboxes. So individual groups, what we do on our end is help you consolidate here, right? So we are able to say one central account with 75 aliases coming into it.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So now, whether the board members use their own email address or a domain doesn't matter because we've got one major identifying factor which is the,

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  yeah, it came through the group.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It came through the group. So now you can say the two email is present in either you can use a custom object or you can just say contains any of Adidas. Com.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Or it can say Adidas at mighty nonprofits. Com. Yeah, which is, could be the group, right? I'm going to just say that mighty nonprofits. Com. Yep. So when this comes in now, you are able to automatically perfect.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yep.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Assign it to that person who is in charge or you can pick it up from the custom object, the mapping, whatever. Yeah, or you can choose automatically here as well. Or you can also add a tag that says, yeah, Adidas, yeah. And you can also by the way, based on that group, if you have specific items that you want to, do, you want to send a reply, you want to notify other people based on that specific group, you can.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So let's I'm just going to save and enable this for a second, just to show you. So whenever an email comes in and it's sent to that… particular group?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It gets assigned to the right people or even if you've got more than one person assigned to a particular client, we can help you round Robin between that small subgroup of people. So there's a lot of options there. In general, there's some like you can literally set up, hey, every time I get like a pissed off customer in my inbox, I want it escalated. You can do stuff like that, which we will come to. But the final piece of this puzzle is you come into the support, the main support inbox, and you can create a view for that particular client. And the best part is this view can be a dynamic view. So it will only contain open and pending emails. So I'm going to say Adidas com and click apply and I can actually save this view not just for myself but for everybody on the team. So Adidas com, client number one or something like that. You can click save. And now this gets saved for everybody right here. If I am the person who's in charge of Adidas. I don't care about closed and pending, all of that stuff I get into that. I start Adidas, I bring it right to the top. And even if multiple people are looking after that client, all they have to do is log in every day, come to this section. And hiver is tagging it, putting it into this folder. And as you are completed, as you resolve emails, they go out of that folder as well. So it only shows you what that client has. Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Works just like the other shared inboxes that's great. Yeah, I was assuming we couldn't keep all the individual Google groups because of the responses. Can you walk me through that because we want it to feel seamless from the client side?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely and more importantly feel seamless for your users as well because we don't want them to keep selecting which one to choose, right? So, what hiver does is it helps you create all of these aliases as sending options over here. So in your send mail, as you will have options for all of these. So as you can tell in my side, I have finance operations and support. I have finance operations and support, but I've also got HR and success, which are aliases of one of these, right? So all I have to do is select this option over here, which is reply from the same message the email was sent. So if an email is sent to Joe, it'll reply from Joe, if an email is sent to, from client one, it'll reply from client one, and it does it automatically. So.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  That'll work with the groups?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  So, if it was sent to the group email address and then filtered in through here, if we have this button clicked when we respond, it'll come right back through the group email.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That is correct.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  That's great. Yeah, that's great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And the reason why we're able to do that is because we're not building any of this. We're just relying on Google stuff and we're adding our layer on top.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay. Interesting. Yeah, because if we did that, then it'd basically be no change for our clients.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Zero change.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  There's no like roll out and be like, hey, you guys start sending emails to this and it's going to be weird, right? So basically just plugging into what we already have.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay. That helps. So then, yeah. So then this would work like the other shared inboxes. And that way we can create the different views for each client. We can assign the views. Can you assign views to specific people?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You cannot assign views to specific people, but specific people can have different sets of, yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  And then I saw the assign rules you can assign to the account owner. So, I guess or to the client owner, right? Was that the thing?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, yeah, that you can definitely assign it to the client owner. So either you do like just rules where you define what you need in those rules or you don't want to define and create multiple and keep changing it. In that case, you can just go down the route where you give us the mapping like you upload the file and we will be able to sort of like pull from that file, pull from that mapping and assign anyway.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, cause we switch clients a bunch, right? So let's say we wanted to switch who it was assigned to. I'm imagining in the rules, we can just assign to an individual user also instead of just owner, I can just say, hey for this workflow, assign it to Vanessa and then shit, Vanessa's not going to do it anymore, assign it to this. Okay? Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So you can literally change it like that. And even if it goes to Vanessa and Vanessa is not able to, she's able to take all other emails, just that one. She's not able to do that case. You can just like assign it to someone else manually. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking about. Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Great. So given all, given those constraints, what level of service, what level of subscription would we need to do that to do everything we've talked about so far? So it's basically going to be one inbox, but with a lot of automations, right?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, I think based on your functionality, I think that you don't need to go all the way up to why that keeps happening. I don't think you need to go all the way up to, the elite package. I think we could get you sort of a custom build if you let us know a number of users, number of mailboxes, of course, we don't want to like restrict you on mailboxes or number of automation. So we'd probably go back to our team, see what, see a custom sort of set up. We can put together for you. But yeah, we'll… make sure that that's not standing in the way.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, cause I think there was some criteria where it was like, oh my God to do what we want to do. We're going to have to be like elite crazy level and I was like, well, we're not there's only of us, we're not doing a, you know, a.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Few.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  100 messages a day. But yeah… we've got people in the organization.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Okay.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  We're hiring and growing fast. So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Of course. Yeah, no, that makes sense in terms of sort of pricing… aside, right? Pricing. Like I said, matt and I will just go quickly discuss and we'll get back to you with like a proposal, anything else that's outstanding that's sort of standing in the way of you? I know you said you were looking at a few other tools, what is sort of that in a way of hiver being your top choice?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, before it was functionality, trying to see if it really worked. So, the, I didn't know this about the Google groups that we could actually respond from the Google group. So that helps, that sort of brings you guys on the same playing field with functionality with the other with the competition. Before you guys did our functionality. It was like, oh, I'm not sure it's really going to work.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Now we think it, you guys are on the same page at this point more or less the, so then it's really more like the AI tools. And then the big thing for us, is the pricing, right? We're not used to spending a lot of money on software. So this, you know, right now, Zendesk is a lot cheaper than everybody else. So we're kind of like, oof, that's a lot better option, but, you know, so, so we'll see but the AI capabilities really curious. And then, you know, like additional features, right? Like Hubspot gives us a whole bunch of extra stuff that we wouldn't have otherwise, so that's really where I'm thinking right now I'm comparing.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Gotcha. Yeah, yeah, no. So we use Hubspot as well, internally of course, for a different part of, the different part of their process for their product. Yeah, we use it for like their core CRM offering. And we've been using it for many years and, because of that, I think, I, I'm very familiar with that sort of shared inbox capabilities. And I'm sure you've taken a look at as well. The one thing that I think might be sort of counterintuitive… for your team is just the departure from just emails as whole. They sort of do it in their own format and structure. Just my two cents because we use Hubspot internally as well. So, I will talk through AI very quickly and then we will talk about pricing in terms of AI. What we're trying to do is essentially give you the ability to train your AI to make it work for your team. So, if you've got information in a notion page, in PDFS, in sort of sops that you want that you want your team to focus on, we actually help you sort of configure that, here. So, first thing that you can do is you can go in here and give us your knowledge sources. You can either connect notion, custom… documents, like PDFS, word files, whatever you want to learn from, whatever you want to learn it, it to learn from. And if you want to set up a knowledge base on hiver, you can actually sort of learn from that as well. But this is what it learns from, in addition to your actual email responses. And the way you resolve queries with your clients. So, it's learning from all of these. And once it does, what it helps you do is it helps you do a few different things. I'm, going to show that to you in the home page. First things first. I'm, not sure whether sentiment really plays a big part. You tell me if it does, but it first sets up sentiment where it can pick up the tone and see whether there's a frustrated conversation somewhere. And like I mentioned before, based on that sentiment, for example, if there is a frustrated conversation, you can set up a workflow where you escalate and bring people in and even send a proactive reply automatically. The second thing that it does is it tags your emails. I'm going to find an email where it's got tagging done. Maybe this one… just give me a second.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  There is one here where it actually got tagged by the… there we go. So, in this case, right? Our AI actually learns from your emails and actually tags emails for you. And at any time where you think that this email should not be tagged with this particular, you can report it and tell us why and learn from that. And it can also do stuff like this where it can extract information from the email. So we actually extract information from like ours is ticket summary. But what we are, AI can do is also extract like invoice information. So if you're using Netsuite or quickbooks, it can automatically sort of like grab information from the email, read it and it can give you in sort of a smart search of that particular invoice and quickbooks or Netsuite. So in my case, it is po 25. I click on it, and immediately I get all the information back from Netsuite related to that particular invoice. We also have a smart preview where it'll you just hover over it and it'll give you a good amount of information from your third party invoice provider or ERP about status of an invoice, what is going on in it. And this updates in real time. Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Cool.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And the main piece where all of this sort of comes together is our co pilot where you can either ask it questions. For example, in my case, I want to say what is hiver's, onboarding assistance? I click that and it's going to give me a response about our onboarding assistance. This runs on gpt five. So it is making decisions as quickly as possible. So it's going to give me full information that I can use here or I can go in and say… draft a reply and it'll actually draft a contextual reply for that email right next to it. It'll give you three options and this is based on the knowledge that you fed it. For example, in this case, it'll say connect to billing specialist. I'm going to say number one because… they've asked literally for, can you connect me with someone who can assist with billing? And then it'll write the response based on that question and you can just insert and put it in there. Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  That's great. Was the AI an add on cost? Or was that included in the subscription?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It is an add on cost? Yes.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, but we don't do per resolution kind of rates. It's just a flat AI add on cost. But yeah, as we're getting closer to the end of our year, we can get really creative with packages for both if that's something that you are interested in considering.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, it's included in most of the other software that we're looking at, right? It's sort of, I think nowadays everybody just can like AI is the future. And so it's really included in a lot of these other packages. And our team uses AI outside of we're already drafting responses using some side things. So we really do want it integrated and part of the system.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Of course, of course… I've seen, based on my look at the competition, I think there's two models to go. I think where we've gone with the add on model, and that's something we're considering as well because this is all evolving very quickly. Yeah, the others that you mentioned they might be included, but you might, there's a per resolution cost which is something that we are also thinking about to see what's best.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So there is a per resolution cost if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, but we can definitely like I said, get creative around that.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah… Vanessa, did you have any questions before we have to wrap up?

Vanessa Alonzo (vanessa@mightynonprofits.com):
  No, not really. I like how you, I think it is very user friendly. So yeah, I like it. Can you tell us please Jeevan, what other industries you have as clients just to have an idea?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Yeah, maybe I'm going to just pull up our deck. So we've actually got a lot of different that's not the right one. Do.

Vanessa Alonzo (vanessa@mightynonprofits.com):
  You have already other bookkeeping firms with?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You, yeah, we have, we work with a lot of accounting and bookkeeping firms, not just bookkeeping firms specifically, we work with a lot of just accounting, ap, Ar teams in a lot of firms. In fact, last… quarter we onboarded the full billing and ap team over at udemy, they're using us for very similar requests teams at amplitude. Clear. All of these are, we have, these are all accounts I've worked with. So they're just top of mind, but I'm just going to pull up my deck a little bit so you can see like a couple of others. We can also, we actually have a case study with a… cloud accounting firm called countless in New York. So they've been long, very long term customers. So the reason why is because we don't and the reason why we've seen success in that space is we don't really want to disrupt the way your team is communicating or your clients are communicating with you. We want to keep it as emails and give you the functionality there. But yeah, just give me a second. Okay. Yeah.

Vanessa Alonzo (vanessa@mightynonprofits.com):
  And what about the setup process? For example, for companies such as helpscout, you have to go through a setup process, right? And the learning curve probably is longer than what it is with you, can you tell us a little bit about that? Do you provide any support or how does it work please?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I'm glad you asked that question. I think that's a really important question. So we take that really seriously. So you're going to get two types of support with us. You're going to get 24 seven tech support again at no additional cost, you get on call and that's something that again Joe, you might see differently in some of those names you mentioned, but 20… four seven tech support.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Is that phone support as well as chat?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We get chat and email, and if you need to jump on a call, my team will send you a link and you can either schedule some time with them or they'll send you a link for right then and they can jump on call with you like conferencing, and that's contractually obliged by the way it's in your terms. Second is you get onboarding and a dedicated success person throughout your interaction with hiver. They will help with configuration setup like setting up workflows, training the team. And again, that is not additionally charged. It is part of your subscription. So we actually what we discuss here on the pricing page is what you get.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Is that onboarding? Is that a set number of meetings or is it flexible? How does that usually work?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You tell us?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You tell us? Yeah, you tell us, we don't there's no like, oh, you get five meetings and nothing like that. If you need five, you need five, you need 10, you need 10.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay. That's how we roll too.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay. Great. And then, yeah, with the pricing curious about the contract too, we've got, we… had this issue. We were trying helpscout and we had to sign a year contract and then we got into it, we're implementing it across the board and the software is broken. It didn't work, but we had to pay for a full year and we're out a couple 1,000 dollars. How does your guys' pricing work? Are we set on a contract? Are we tied into it? Is there a refund period?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You can definitely, there's… two options. We can either go monthly where there's no contract or you can sign an annual contract with us and we typically don't do a refund period in our terms. But if that is something that given that you are just come and come out of an experience, I'm not going to sit here and ask you to take a leap of faith for me. If you, if you are open, if we find pricing and if it looks good, and if you are open to considering hiver, I am happy to go back to my team and try to get approval on like a 30 day cash out or like an opt out where you can set up for the first 30 days and we give you an opt out at the end of it just because I want to sort of take a step forward before I ask you to take a leap of faith. So, yeah, I'm happy to do that. Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Great. Yeah, because that was a bad experience.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I bet.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  It looked great. And then once we actually get a lot of volume and set up in it, it's actually doesn't work. So that was not good.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. No, we'll make sure that we, if we do sort of find functionality with your sorry agreement with pricing, we will make sure to include that in our code.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Great. Okay. All the questions I've got then.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. So, matt and I, so I know pricing is the outstanding bit outside of pricing. Is there anything else that is still a concern that is not giving you the confidence that we wanted to?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Do you guys have like a, I think you have a demo account, right? Like I can demo it and plug it in and start playing with it? Yeah, we're going to do that with whatever software we pick one.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  100 percent, 100 percent and we don't want you to just, yeah, yeah, of course. And that's rightfully, so we do have a trial period.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We do not want you to jump into that trial period just sort of we don't we're not some of the one of those companies that say here's a link here's, a document, figure it out. We actually, if you do, we'll actually can have like a quick kickoff call where we help you set up show you sort of like give you like example of proof of concepts of like some of the stuff we spoke about today, you, we, the trial environment comes with the sandbox with like a bunch of emails about like spilled coffee and stuff like that. But if you wanted to like connect, maybe one of your groups, you can… that's completely up to you. We don't have any restrictions. It's about like how much volume you want to pull in there for the trial. But, yeah, that's something we can definitely help you get set up.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, yeah. And it's really like looking at when I've been testing the other ones and it's like seeing how easy it is to put the workflow? How easy is it to do the tags? And just helpful when we actually get my hands on it to play with it?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  100 percent. In fact, some, most times matt and I recommend it in most cases, but yeah, we can definitely help you do that.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, would that be a good next step to this? Maybe like schedule 15, 20 minutes sometime next week to help you get started, show you an example each of maybe a workflow or tag and a view and everything, so that, at least, you know, we get you started along those lines.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Well, I think the next step is the pricing. So if it's too expensive, it's going to be a jump for us, right? And so, I'm probably not going to want to do the trial because then I'll really like, you know, it's like playing with stuff I can't afford, which would suck.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yep, I understand. So I want to go back and make this a no brainer for you, Joe. So do you have like sort of like a budget or a number in mind that you are working around? Because then we can try to get creative and get around that for both the pro and the.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah. The competition Zendesk is they've dropped their price to 35 75 per seat. So like 36 bucks a seat is what they've dropped it down to. And that includes the AI. So that's the competition that you guys are competing against Hubspot's, expensive. They're going to get back to us. They'll hopefully they'll drop it down to 70 dollars a seat, but there's a big differences. So we're going to probably decide, hey, do we want? Should we just go with Zendesk since it is cheaper? It might not be quite as cool or do we pay extra, but how much extra, right? So that's kind of where we're at… all of these are, we don't have a set budget, right? But all of these are more expensive than any other software. We're paying for the next most expensive software is 20 bucks a month right now, which is.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Which I guess is close to being like Google even is lesser than that, yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Like our task management click up is like 20 bucks per user per month. So, yeah, it's a jump no matter what.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Understandable. OK. So… matt, let matt and I chat a bit at the end of the call, we will sort of maybe send you a proposal. We're going to try and get close to the Zendesk proposal, but we just want to be able to chat internally, get dot, our I's cross our T's and if that, if the proposal looks OK, then we could potentially sort of throw some time for next week just so that because we're going up into thanksgiving, half our team is in an event in Chicago next week. All right? Just to sort of we can always modify and reschedule if required. But Tuesday, maybe it sounds like a good time if pricing looks good.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  We have an audit Monday and Tuesday. So any time after Tuesday might be good.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Wednesday better?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  OK. So we'll probably try to send you an invite for the same time on Wednesday. And of course, like I said, we can modify it if required and in the meantime, let matt and I chat. We'll get back to you with a proposal maybe even today and you can let us know what you think. All I will say is we're… happy to have a conversation about this. So keep us in the loop. And if I'm the only reason I'm saying this is I'm so confident that this could be a good fit. I've seen it be a really good fit before and I'd hate to be hateful pricing to come in the way right at the end. So we will definitely try to make that happen.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Great. Yeah, Wednesday would work good. I'm free from 11 30 on Wednesday. So 11 30 work. So not quite 12 but a half hour earlier.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's fine. That's perfect. It shouldn't be a problem. Yeah, it works. Yeah, we can do that.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah. And then we're trying to roll this. We want to get this all rolled out in place set and our team trained and everybody good before January first because January is crazy time. So we're easy. We're trying to make decisions in the next week or two.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Yeah. We will move as quickly as you do in terms of onboarding, our typical onboarding, our typical onboarding says two weeks in our document, but that's just sort of a conservative estimate given that people might not be ready to schedule immediately.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Teams might need scheduling issues, multiple meetings and everything. So, but we can definitely our average time on generally is a week. So we got you covered.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Great. Thanks, Javon. It's super helpful. This is cool. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Not anything else.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  No, I think that was it. I know. Thanks man. Thank you very much for your.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Time. Thanks, Joe.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Have a great weekend. Bye. See you guys. Bye bye.
