Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Lucas.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Hey, Cole. Good morning.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good morning. How are you?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  I am doing fantastic. I had to change the initial time. I realized it was a bit too early for me.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, no worries. I appreciate you hopping on here… and just to confirm, do you only have 15 minutes for this call?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  No, we can definitely go to the top of the hour mark.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. Well, just to set a quick agenda, Lucas, and hop into the call, I would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role, what got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Sure. Appreciate it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I can introduce myself first here. My name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the email management client experience space for a little over six years now. And yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can potentially help you all today.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Sure.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then a quick intro on your side,

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  so, just for introductions, so on the web, yeah, yeah, sure. So I'm Lucas, I'm with the trackstreet. So I'm the web operations manager. We are based out of Nevada, Las Vegas and essentially what we're looking to get from a help desk, which at the moment, we have sort of just a couple tools that we use to make that happen. But we wanted to have a way to automatically assign ownership that is something that it's pretty manual. So we have a couple emails support, you… know, a couple support emails where we have the inquiries come through, but it's a shared inbox to Gmail. So it's a Gmail group, but it takes some time to just to route this email to route the inquiries. So we wanted that. And as well, we track most of the, we have a different tool to track the ownership and the task management. So we wanted to maybe be able to consolidate that. And the other thing was we want to be able to measure some performances and customer satisfaction which we don't do at the moment. Yeah. And we want to see if we can integrate with helpscout as well, which is what we use. Yeah. So that's it. And maybe on the collaboration as well. We rely on slack majorly at the moment. So we want to see how your collaboration goes. You know, how we can tag maybe different inquiries as well as, you know, mentions on your collaboration piece, yeah, reminders as well. So reminders really? So, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. No, perfect. That's super helpful. So how many it's primarily three emails that you're managing today, three different Google groups?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many people today, Lucas are managing the emails?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  So we have about six folks.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Six people who respond to emails, yeah.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Nope. So this is just on the customer service side.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. And how many people are providing customers? Like how many people would need a license to something like hiver?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  So, I mean, we want to issue out to maybe different engineers and different. So we're looking at about a third plus folks.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. So I can hop into the product demonstration here. Lucas, give you a rundown of hiver, how we're going to help you better manage those Google groups. But just to kick off the demonstration, right? What's nice about hiver, is you're going to log in with your normal Gmail, and just to confirm, are you using Gmail today?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Yeah, we are using Google.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Groups, correct? Yeah. So logging in, you're just going to use your, you know, standard email and you're going to have access to those Google groups on the left hand side. So up top is your personal inbox where I can manage my personal email communications. And then these yellow tinted inboxes below are those Google groups that we're managing as an organization. So this is a customer success, Google group, finance, healthcare info operations. Let's take a look at this support, share mailbox that's created from a Google group. So when I click into the mailbox, it's going to open up some sub views beneath it that's going to help us manage the intake of communication. The first is the unassigned section, new emails that have hit the share mailbox that need to be distributed either through automation or manual assignment. The next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me. And then there's the team view. So here's where you can see within this Google group itself, what is everyone currently working on in real time? What's outstanding and what needs to be completed. Just want to pause here, Lucas, any questions so far?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  I mean, so far? That makes sense?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. So going into the mind view, right? I've been assigned these two conversations from this specific Google group. And I'll click into this email for this example. And on the right hand side, you know, we're going to have a hiver tab that can be opened or closed that can help us manage the intake of the communication. So the first thing we can do is assign an email. So in this case, I've assigned it to myself, Cole miller, letting the team know. I'm going to follow up with this communication. The next way Lucas, that we can assign work is through a round Robin automation that will equally distribute emails amongst the group as amongst the Google group as it comes in. And then the last way that we can assign work is through skill based routing which I think is what you're looking for. So being able to identify email types whether it's looking through the body of text, for keywords, searching through the subject line, for keywords, or phrases or even identifying the domain that is reaching out to that Google group. And then we're able to create automations around some of those identifiers to assign them to a specific rep or a person.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How ideally in your world would you want the routing to work? Would it be like skill based? How would you want that?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Yeah. And I mean ideally at the moment, just skill based depending on what it's about. Yeah, I'd say. So maybe finance goes to somebody who's billing as well as maybe bags or something like that goes to engineering. So, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. And then we can track things like status, whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks or that task management to ensure we're working things through to a resolution… adding those tags for organizational purposes. These tags are helpful for creating buckets folders or views of the conversation. We can also report on these tags on the backend for additional analytics. Any questions on those couple things so far?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Right. So I'm looking at… no, I'm in makes sense. We can go ahead.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. And then we have the ability to create custom fields, right? So we can create date range fields, Lucas drop down fields, value… fields and text box fields to organize information. So this is one where it's like, you know, new conversation came in. I created a legal request type. So is this related to an NDA sow order form? So further ways to slice and dice the conversations to understand the topic. We can also report on all these tags, custom fields. And we can also create folders on these custom fields to track different cues for the team.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the last thing here is the collaboration aspect. So you mentioned collaborating. We can do this on the conversations or emails. I'll send this notification to matt. He'll receive that notification up top. He'll click on it. It'll take him right to this thread where we can keep having that back and forth. Let's say he comes into the conversation, he can use our AI summarizer to get up to speed on the conversation really quickly. And then maybe we'll use our AI co pilot as well to draft a reply. So our AI co pilot can help streamline responses by searching through data sources that you feed it to help you know, your team do their job more efficiently and effectively. So I'm going to pick the first prompt here, confirm attendance and request reminder delivery method.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then I can insert this into the draft for further, you know, for further editing or just send it out as is.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Want to pause here? What are your thoughts on all of this so far?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  So far it really aligns with some of the functionality that we had in mind. So, yeah, I'm just thinking and, you know, I love the whole idea of just working in Google space. So, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. For sure. I mean, do you have integrations with Hubspot? So we can, you know, pull in data from Hubspot. So this is our apps integration page right here. See if I can find a Hubspot. One. I don't have it in this demo, but it kind of looks similar like this, right? So I'm pulling in this contact and account info from Salesforce, for instance, it would just be Hubspot in your case, but we have that ability to pull in information from Hubspot. So you can review it. And then on top of that, we can trigger actions into tools whether it's like, you know, creating contacts, leads, whatever that might be.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But going to analytics, you… know, what's nice about our analytics? We do give you good understanding of workload as well as performance. So let's say we want to take a look at the last 90 days. We'll choose the support shared mailbox or Google group that we want to report on here. We can see active new resolve conversations over that time period. You know, what our average first response time was as a team, our average resolution time as a group… individual performance metrics. So emails assigned per user, how many emails have been sent out per user? And then individual performance metrics below, like showing, hey, what was Cole's average first response time over the last 90 days and what was Cole's average resolution time? So just stack ranking how people are performing and providing coaching where necessary.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Tag analytics. So understanding, you know, why are people reaching out to the Google groups? What are the hot topics we're seeing bottlenecks, trends, identifying why these queries are flooding in over a certain time period?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Anything additional that you would want to see from an analytics perspective? Lucas?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Really? So, yeah. I mean, so the representation of the maybe csat scores, yeah… we'll have to see, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we can send customer satisfaction surveys after to gauge from an aggregate and individual basis. And then we do have AI sentiment analysis as well. Another feature of our AI that can actually search through conversations and grade how they are from a neutral, negative, very negative positive interaction.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Right. So I also assume that you can customize the reports from, you know, the custom reports.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. So totally customizable. The data is yours to slice and dice it as you see fit, right? So, these are all the custom fields that we have, you know, different assignees tags and you choose the metrics that you want to see completely configurable based on the data that you want to view.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Perfect.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then going, and then we do have the ability to export the data as well. So if you want it to be exported on a daily weekly, monthly basis, we can export all of it as well.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Perfect.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then going into the admin panel, Lucas, this is where we're going to set up the platform. So we do email management, but we also do offer chat for websites, whatsapp integrations, voice providers. We do offer an internal external knowledge base and then a customer portal for people to log in and create and track tickets. And then this is where we'll do things like create automations. Slas, leverage our AI as well as our integration. So we do have an integration with slack as well as you can see, we have that integration with Hubspot right here, but we can push out actions or we can push out notifications into slack channels to individual users through our integration with slack as well.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Oh, so, do you, also, can you embed like a chatbot on the website?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes. So we do have a chatbot capability that you can embed on the website.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Got it. Okay. I missed that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then going to the, you know, where we'll create and manage shared mailboxes. So right now, I'm in the, you know, the shared mailbox admin view, seeing all the ones not managing as an organization. So I'll click on the support one here. And this is where we can manage the participants who has access to that specific Google group in hiver, the general round Robin auto assignment that will equally distribute conversations as they come in… those custom fields. So completely configurable based on the data that you're looking to collect on these conversations, you can create them here. And then our AI module. So we do have the AI tagging for automatically triaging and adding tags to the conversations as they flow in. We have the AI sentiment analysis and then the AI co pilot for generating responses, summarizing and composing emails. And then this is where I think you're going to get a lot of benefit. Lucas, you said you wanted to create automations, right? Yeah. This is one where it's like, you know, new conversation comes into the Google group. Let's say if you know, in the subject or in the body of text, we've identified the keywords invoice or billing. So since we've identified in the body of text, the email that it's an invoice or billing request. We're going to assign this,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm sorry, that's condition.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We're going to assign this to, you know, myself because I deal with those requests. Is that ideally, what you would want in an automation or would you want more of like an assign among where it's like let's assign these requests amongst let's say these three people?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  What I'm thinking we can use both of, of that. So, yeah, I mean, so we can definitely, I can definitely see how we can use assigning to and, assigning these amongst. So, yeah, they will do as a day.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. And you can have a bunch of different conditions, right? So, this is just showing the body of text, but it could be from an email from a domain to an email, so on CC that you can really get granular with these conditions. Yeah. And then from an action perspective, you know, a bunch of different actions that we can take as well to streamline what you're doing, sending responses, automated, adding tags, automated and things of that nature.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. And then the last thing here before, last couple of things here, the csat, so this is where we can, you know, measure client engagement. I usually recommend to automatically send the survey. Once you close the email, you can customize the snippet what it looks like. And then this is what the client will see when you send it out.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we do have the general autoresponder. So, being able to send automated emails for, you know, within business hours and out of business hours, just letting them know the email was received and we'll get back to them.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  So, are these surveys? Can we customize that as well?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For the autoresponder?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Nope. The surveys.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, the surveys, yeah, you can customize the snippet text here. You can customize this. So I just changed it and you can change the language in the middle and all that stuff.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Oh, got it. Okay. Makes perfect sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, the last thing here, Lucas, is the slas, I think these are really helpful for tracking first response times and resolution times. So we can either have a general SLA that affects all conversations. But let's say you have a specific one for let's say it's a high priority request, right? We've we've added the tag high priority to the email to change it to the high priority queue. We're now going to have a first response goal of 30 minutes and a resolution goal of 24 hours. If we're not able to hit these metrics, you can choose, you notified to escalate the conversation. So, just a great way to, you know, track how people are performing. And if they're not responding within that timeframe that we've set as an organization, let's get the right people involved. And then from a management perspective, you can see, you know, let's say I go into the operations inbox… I go into the team view. You can see from a high level which slas are expired. As you can see this one down, says first response has been overdue. So, everything with red will show you what needs to be prioritized.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Let me see if I can find some more too. Yeah, see, there's more red ones in this one. So, first response overdue helps you prioritize and see from a manager perspective, you know, what we need to do?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But that's pretty much the main things I wanted to cover, today, Lucas. We do also offer a free trial to start off if that's something you would be interested in?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Oh, yeah. Sure. 100 percent.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  When would be a good time for you to kick off, the free trial? I can also, I can also get you up and running right now. It takes like 10 minutes.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  So, my, what about we, can… we regroup sometime maybe later today or tomorrow? Let's regroup tomorrow, and then get that set up?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And what time would work for you tomorrow? You're based out at Las Vegas, you said?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Yeah, yeah. So, I can do morning. So anywhere at nine a. M, through, two P. M?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And that's nine a. M. PST. Yeah, here, let me send this over to you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Let me do 30 minutes later. So, I just sent over an invite for tomorrow at nine 30, a. M PST.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  I'll go ahead and then set that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That, that time works for you nine 30,

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Yeah, it works. Perfect. Okay. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. And I can also send you a follow up after this, you know, with our pricing page, actually, we can go into pricing real quick.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Sure.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So for what you would be looking to accomplish, you would either, I would recommend the, elite plan because that comes with that assign among feature that can do the mini round Robin. It sounds like that would be, you know, very beneficial as well as the elite version is going to give you unlimited automations, which it sounds like you're going to be pretty heavy on those as well.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, 75 dollars per user per month. Obviously, if you're buying, you know, a good amount of licenses, we can work on that discount, to get that per user cost down. This is just overall list. But let's just ensure this is a product fit first, and then we can work on, the pricing side that, that's the easy part for us.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Yeah, I think, that sounds like a fair point.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So, we're all set for tomorrow's, kickoff, but, I appreciate the time today, Lucas, I'll follow up with some more information after this and looking forward to kicking off the trial tomorrow.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, can you hear me?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Yeah, I mean, my pleasure. And to, oh,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  oh, sorry, you're breaking up. What'd you say, Lucas?

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Oh, yeah. So, I was just going about, you know, really excited to evaluate this and, I think, should be looking forward to the next steps, appreciate, the information.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Lucas. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  You have a nice one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You too.

Lucas Mansur (lmansur@tracksstreet.com):
  Yes, bye bye.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Bye.
