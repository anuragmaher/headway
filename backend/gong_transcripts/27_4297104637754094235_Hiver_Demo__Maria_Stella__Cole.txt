Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Cecelia.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Hi, there.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How are you?

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Good. How are you doing? Doing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Well, doing well.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  I said day two, I start all over. Yeah, new year, day two.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Doing good. Just getting back in the swing of it. We're still on the week of New Year's though. So, I feel like it really starts next week. Yeah. And then we're waiting for a few others, right?

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Correct. We're waiting for Maria and Craig to join us.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. Where are you based out of though?

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  I'm in Chicago.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, very cool. I was actually there like a couple months ago for a conference.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Oh, nice. Which one were you here for?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It was the customer success collective.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Okay. Where was it held at?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  One of these hotels in, was it river park, the area… Riverside north? Oh, you're.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  downtown then? Yeah, river north?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's it river north.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that was a nice area. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It was a nice area to have it. That was my first time there. It was a really cool city. Okay. Perfect. Looks like everyone has joined. Awesome, but no, I appreciate, you know, y'all hopping on the call here today. So, just to set a quick agenda and hop into it, would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand all of your roles, what prompted you to book a meeting with hiver?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then we can jump into a product demonstration. Then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps, but I can introduce myself first. So, my name's Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the customer service space for a little over six years now. And yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can help y'all tonight.

Maria:
  Hi, Cole. I'm the one that booked the meeting. I'm Maria, I'm the special projects analyst here at bws. I oversee all the tech here at the company and I have been with bws for about five years now.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  And I am the director of new business development, and I've been working with Maria, transitioning Maria in between here, and I'm just trying to make sure that we're picking the right tools for our teams.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  And I'm the president of bws logistics and, you know, making sure we are doing our best to make the right choices on tech that we have. Hey.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Perfect. No, that's super helpful. And just to kind of understand further, Maria, from your perspective, what are you looking to solve for with hiver? What kind of brought you to the call today? Would love to understand that further?

Maria:
  We're looking, we can only use front. Not sure if you are familiarized with that, you know, email collaboration tool app. We're looking for other options in the market and hiver pop up to be totally honest. It was a, you know, we were just looking at different options in the market and this was one of the ones that popped up. I looked on your website and it looks very familiar as with what we already got. So we are just, you know, hoping to see what you guys can offer if it fulfills our, you know, basic requirements or what other stuff you offer that we don't have right now.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And what kind of is prompting you to take a look to move off of front? Is it something that front isn't able to handle? What's kind of driving the evaluation to move off of the platform?

Maria:
  You know, we have been with front for five years already. We are always looking for new options in the market front is a great tool. But I think our two biggest, you know, reasons why we're looking first, the pricing has increased a lot over the past years… secondary, we have been having some few like glitches with them, not bigger issues. But, you know, we just want to make sure that if we do decide to move into a new app, that it's going to be, you know, that we're not going to have these, you know, like issues of like glitches or breakdowns of the, because it's our main collaboration tool. So it's like it's really huge for us and important for us that it's the correct decision and it works perfectly or at least as perfect as it could be.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And how are you using front today? Like are you primarily using it as like an email communication tool? Like how are you leveraging front?

Maria:
  We have it connected with Gmail, which is our, you know, we use Google workspace, and then we shared inboxes, we have, you… know, discussions. I think the only thing that we don't use it for is like social media or like calls or something like that. But besides that, it's you know, Gmail plus anything like collaboration wise, being able to tag people into different conversations, being able to comment on email threads, shared inboxes, assign emails to the different teams, being able to build rules like automation rules, et cetera.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. No, that's super helpful. And is it primarily just the one shared inbox that you're managing or do you have a couple of different ones across the organization?

Maria:
  We have different ones depending on the different teams. We have the main one which is our like dispatch. And then we have for care sales for quotes, et cetera. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And one more question before we hop into the demonstration, are you using Gmail or outlook from an email client perspective? Yeah. Email, are you using Gmail today? Okay. Got it. So we do have two solutions. We have one that is built within the Google workspace. And then we have another one that's you know, within Gmail. So taking a look at my screen here, what's nice about hiver, you know, we're a simple but yet very effective tool.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  That was.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  A call recording that I was reviewing earlier, that just started playing.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  But,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  would you be more interested in seeing like the solution that's built within the Google workspace, or like our standalone platforms, we do have both and just want to kind of do what you would be more interested in based on your research?

Maria:
  Is.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  there a cost if you did it independent, your independent platform versus within Gmail? Like is there a cost difference of what we would use? So it's the same?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It's the same cost. It's just preference, right? Some people like when it's integrated within the Google workspace, because it's one less platform that you need to kind of log into and work with. And then some people like would rather prefer to have it separate. So it really just depends on the preference and what you would rather have me demonstrate today.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Well, let's see how it works. I've kind of seen how it works within the Google platform. Let's see how it's independent to see if that's comparable to what front is.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. Awesome. Let me just share my screen and then we can hop into this here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So taking a look at my screen here, so what's nice about hiver team is that you can log into our web application with Google sso. So you don't need another like username or login. And then once you do, it gives you access to this hiver application right here where we can manage your personal email communications up top. And then, you know, the shared inboxes below. So we have these different shared inboxes, you know, like human resources, operations, sales support. For this example, you know, I'll take a look at the support share mailbox. And when I click into this right, it's going to open up those sub views beneath it. That's going to help us manage the intake of communications. So the first is the mine, everything that's been assigned to me. The next is the unassigned new emails that have hit the share mailbox that need to be distributed. And then there's the team view. So really just understanding from a high level, what is everyone working on in real time across this support share mailbox? What's outstanding, and what needs to be completed across the group. So let's say, you know, Jeevan was working this conversation, but he's like out of office or something. I'm going to just reroute this to myself and take this. And once we start working through these conversations, right? Since I took this from Jeevan, it's now going to go to the specific mine view letting the team know that, you know, I'm taking ownership of this and I'm going to work through this to a resolution. And on the right hand side, we're going to have some of these other capabilities to track the status, whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks, adding those tags for organizational purposes to put conversations in buckets, folders or views. We could also leverage these tags to provide analytics on the backend to understand, you know, why people have reached out over a certain timeframe, what are the hot topics we're seeing across those specific share mailboxes… and then custom fields to further kind of slice and dice those conversations, whether it's escalation type, maybe a certain ticket request, maybe it's a specific, you know, billing request that we received and things along those lines. Want to pause right here. Any questions so far?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No. Okay. Cool. And that's the first way we can route work, right? Is like manually by choosing who you want to do it. But then there's a couple other ways that we can also assign work. The next is a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the conversations as they come in amongst the people associated with that share mailbox. And then the next way is skill based routing. So maybe, you know, kind of like you said before Maria creating those rules where it's like if this, then that functionality. So let's say, like if walmart, com reaches out to that mailbox, let's always assign that conversation to Craig or like something like that. So we can also create those specific rules. So certain people handle certain clients, certain request types. We can identify those through key keywords or key phrases, and then make sure that it goes to the right person. And then we have that ability to collaborate internally to have those internal conversations. I'll send this notification to matt, he'll, receive this notification, top left, where he'll then you know, click on that conversation or click on that notification and it'll bring him right to this thread where maybe he'll use like our AI summarizer to get up to speed really quickly if it's like a really long thread. But let's say, you know, we keep having this back and forth conversation. We're not sure how we want to respond to the client. We do have the ability to leverage our AI co pilot as well to streamline responses. So our AI co pilot can search through PDFS, word documents. Maybe you have like notion as a software that you use, we can also integrate with tools like notion to search through data sources to help streamline your responses. So in this case, I'll just select the first prompts, the first prompt, you know, acknowledge and create that immediate response.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then I could just insert this into the draft either keep editing, you know, or, yeah, maybe I'll like create a shared draft so I can edit it further like with a greater team before I ship it out or something like that. Want to take a quick pause right here? What are your thoughts on this so far? Team?

Maria:
  I've got a question Cole, can you, is notion the only AI tool that we can connect or can we connect? Openai? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we actually leverage openai for this like chatgp is our partner for this co pilot AI summarization and some other AI features that will be rolling out this year. Notion is more of like a repository where people host information that we connect to pull from to help draft replies.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then once we deem, you know, this is done, we're just going to send and close that conversation, changing the status from open to closed. And then we're moving on to the next conversation. And then is it primarily the shared inboxes Maria, that you're collaborating out of today? Is the team like very heavily working within these shared mailboxes on a day to day basis?

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Yeah, we work in that. And then if we have something come to our personal and we need to collaborate there as well like we do that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Maria:
  It's like adding people to our personal emails, right? Like if I receive an email to my personal inbox, I can add Cecelia or whoever I want, and I can decide who are the people that are going to have this ability on that email?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right, right. Okay. Gotcha. If you send.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  this response back to the customer or whoever in this scenario, and then they respond back, will the status change back to open from closed automatically?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's correct. So, if I like sent this and I thought the conversation was closed Craig, but like they come back, let's say like two days later, this will completely reopen this and it'll actually bring it back to me as well to work because I have all the contacts, it'll be sent back to me or if you don't want that to happen, you can do what is like called like send close and unassigned. So if they reach back out, it just goes back to the unassigned queue. So you can either have it. So if they reach back out, it goes to the rep that was working at last, if not, if you send close and unassigned and it just goes back to the unassigned queue.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  Okay. And then the team that it was a part of whatever it would show as unassigned for the support team. And then anybody could deal with it at that point.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. Okay… great. And then we do have the, you know, analytics capabilities. So just understanding some performance and workload metrics over like a certain timeframe.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So let's say we want to take a look at the last 90 days of data and we want to take a look at the support share mailbox. So here we can see things like active new resolve conversations over a time period, what our average first response time was as a team, what our average resolution time was as a group, individual… user metrics. So emails assigned per user, email sent out per user, and then their individual performance metrics below. Like what was Cole's average first response time over the last 90 days? And what was my average resolution time? So it's taking me 501 hours to respond to an email when it gets assigned to me. I'm probably going to be in trouble on Monday.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Cool really fast when you're looking at the users, if it comes from a shared inbox, does it register the actual person that responded as one of their emails sent? Or is it just a shared one?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So it'll register it that it's that specific user when they respond from the shared mailbox?

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  Okay. Will it show their signature information as well? Or will it just say from the hiver, you know, the hiver support team or the bws support team? It won't show Cole miller?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you can have your signature associated with it. So, you know, like who's responding? You can have like your own individual signature set up. And then it'll also be there's an activity log on that side panel at the bottom that I was showing you before, where it will actually show everything that has ever happened with that thread, you know, tags that have been applied, who's been assigned? Who's responded?

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  And we put, and I saw there was a notes thing. How does that look on the, in the email chain as well? When if someone maybe you added notes for Cole to say, hey take, you know, here's, the information, can you send this or something like that? And does that all stay there?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So in that like thread where we were before I'll just go to like a random one here. So it'll stay in this note section historically. So, you know, as I'm kind of like writing these notes and like having that back and forth, it'll just stay in chronological order. You know, you can pin notes. So maybe like important one to stay at the top, whatever it might be.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the couple other reports that are helpful that we have are the, you know, tag reporting. So why are people reaching out to these specific mailboxes by request type based on active new resolve conversations? And then we can see the workload breakdown below like, you know, request types and then the performance by request type. So just identifying trends, bottlenecks, you know, maybe certain things that are going on within the business that we can help identify. And then SLA analytics. So a lot of logistics companies that we work with. So we work with like arrive logistics, flexport, it's like a very common use case for us fox carriers… and a lot of them want to have slas to understand by certain request types, how we're managing it from a first response time and a resolution time perspective. Because with logistics, you know, timing is everything. So here's where we can kind of see how many times we're violating our first response or resolution time goals and how many times we're in compliance as a team. So just ensuring that we're providing good experience as possible and that we're driving towards those slas that we have as an organization. And then the csat analytics. So just a way to gauge how clients are feeling on an aggregate and individual basis. And then all this data, you know, is customizable at the end of the day. The data in hiver is yours to slice and dice as you see fit. So you can kind of, you know, if you wanted to see, you know, overall response times by users with a certain status tags associated. This is where you kind of slice and dice and drill down further on what you want to see based on the metric, the user, whatever it might be.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  If I get an email into my personal inbox, and I want to, I want to send it, I want to, I want to assign it to a team. How do I go about that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So if it goes to your personal inbox, you click up right here. Let me see which one is not associated. Okay? So this is in my personal actually, no, it's not let's see if I have an example here. Okay, perfect. So this was sent to my personal inbox. I have the ability to then add it to a certain shared mailbox. So let's say I want to add to the support. And then from here, I can assign it out.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So,

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  then using that as an example, sorry, Maria to cut you off.

Maria:
  If.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  let's just say Maria is the support team lead or the manager, she can then assign out the, that task.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So then once I add this to the support, it'll land in the unassigned she'll, you know, the manager will be able to see that new conversation is in there. They can distribute it out or you can even be like, hey, like let's, you know, let's assign this out. If you want to send another note as well.

Maria:
  Cool. Would it be like, would I be still be able to see it on my inbox? Or it just got to move completely to support? Like it moved from personal to support?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You would still be, I believe you'd still be able to see it. Yeah. So this is, I can still see it from my personal inbox as you can see, but it's also associated with the support mailbox. So this is the one that we just sent in. So it's still visible from my personal inbox, if I want to like keep seeing that communication. But now the greater team has visibility into it and you can assign it out, collaborate on it and all that stuff.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  So, what if you don't so the shared boxes like human resources, operations, sales support. Like what if they, do, they have to have an email domain associated with it? Can you have a group that doesn't have an email domain? So you could just assign it out? Like, so in our world, we have a track and trace team that really doesn't have like or an order entry? Can we have teams assigned where, like if something came in and I needed like someone to enter the order, but it's not a true team inbox. Is there a way to assign a group of people instead of having… a yeah, instead of an email? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So right now, we would have to have a catch inbox that has an email for us to then like, you know, pull it into the conversation for like collaboration assignments. So like going to the admin panel, like you would have to have like some sort of inbox like this that has a specific email address where we can push it from our personal inbox to the shared mailbox for that tracking collaboration, all that stuff. So if.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  it goes, what if it goes into a shared inbox? But now I want to like notify the, a specific person within the team or like multiple people within the team. Can you do it that way as well? Yes. So if I had to go to support, but then I want like my team that does tracking within support. Is that an option? So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right now, the best way to do that would be using tags. We do have, we will be building like the team capabilities within the next month or so to assign based on specific teams. But right now, how teams are doing is they're creating teams by using tags so that when you apply like let's say like team one tag, that team will be notified, it'll be sent to the team one queue and all those conversations will live in that specific team's queue.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  That would be in that team would see the tag. They wouldn't necessarily, it wouldn't be assigned to them or anything. Would it or I'm maybe I'm a little confused here. It.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Would go to like the view. So by applying that tag, it would go to that specific view from which there, you know, you can delegate it out amongst the team. So if.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  it was a sub team of support using Cecelia's example of track and trace, we would have a track and trace tab, and then they would get notified that something got assigned to them through the tags.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  Okay. And I, and we can have, we can have as many tags as we want. Yep, and it's many team people to be notified on those tags.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. Unlimited tags that you can create in the platform?

Maria:
  Do we have unlimited rules?

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  That's on my list? I was going to ask the same question. Is there unlimited rules there?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Is in our elite plan? So if you go to our elite plan, it's unlimited rules, unlimited mailboxes and all that stuff.

Maria:
  What about discussions? I haven't seen anything like discussions?

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Internal chats?

Maria:
  Between. Yeah, like internal chat. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So all the internal chats would be in the notes section. So this is like pretty much our collaboration and internal conversation like this little notes section right here, but.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  What if it's not on an email and you just want to have like an internal chat with the team? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that's something that pretty much like all of our customers are using like a tool like slack teams. So we don't offer a solution like that. Okay? And then I know we're coming up on four minutes here. This is where we're going to kind of set up the, you know, settings around the shared mailboxes. So the members who are associated with it, you know, the auto assignment maybe like custom fields where we want to track additional data, whatever it might be. And then those automations. So really just like being able to streamline things where it's like new conversation comes inbound. We've identified this subject line of the email that there's the keywords, billing and quote. We're then going to assign this to Rakesh because he deals with billing and quote specifically, we're going to add the tag billing and then update the status to close wherever that might be. So this is where we're going to streamline the assignments, the tags, maybe sending out customized replies based on query type, and so on, and so forth.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, you know, to piggyback off that like let's say this automation hit it's, been assigned to Rakesh. The billing tag has been applied through the automation. From there, an SLA can be triggered from that tag that's been applied automatically. So, you know, billing has been applied. And then since billing has been applied, we're going to have an SLA of first response time of one hour and a resolution goal of 24 hours because it's a billing request. And if we're not able to hit these metrics, you can then choose who you want to notify to be like, hey, you know, this is slip between the cracks. We haven't completed this billing request within our agreed upon SLA.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Any questions on the automations or slas? No. OK. Cool. But I know we are coming up on two minutes here. So just want to get overall feedback so far team. Like what are your thoughts on this so far? Is this something that, you know, just to give you insight on our process? A typical next step for us is like to trial the solution for free for like a week or two? Is that something you know, y'all would be interested in to test out further?

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  What, how's your pricing structure set up? Cole? Is it by user? Is it a flat monthly? How does that work?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it's a per user model. I can pull it up here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, we have these four different plans, the free growth pro elite and how it breaks down is this is all like I'll send you this as well. There's a ton that you can review on this. But some of the key things that is broken down over the plans is different AI functionalities, different amounts of shared inboxes that you can manage. And then different numbers of automations that you can create within the platform. So pro is, you know, typically our most popular that gives you up to five shared mailboxes, 20 rule based automations per mailbox, gives you the AI co, pilot AI agents, and then some of these other features below.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  We are looking at a couple of different things. Why don't you give us a second to… finish our dive into each, and Marie… I'll reach back out to you if we want to move forward.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And how many people are using front today at the business, just curious.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  35 30.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  Five. OK.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  OK. Gotcha. Yeah. And like I said, we do offer the Gmail, you know, the Gmail version as well, kind of curious based on, I know you did some of your due diligence prior. Like would you want to test like the standalone platform, if you did want to move forward or more of like the Gmail function?

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  I think the standalone platform?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  OK. All right. Cool. So.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Really quick though. One last thing is your payment plan, is it yearly or you have to pay it monthly?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We can either do month to month or annual. You'll have more cost savings if you go the annual route.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  OK. Send us both pricing structures so that we can review, OK?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  OK, cool. And would you want me to send you the pricing structure for the pro plan? Does that make the most sense?

Maria:
  Can you include both pro and elite?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. For 35.

Maria:
  Elite is the one that doesn't have any like top on rules and inboxes. Right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Elite is the unlimited and just kind of curious. Also what are you paying for front today? Just curious.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  We're half the price that you just showed us. You're.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  at half the price you're paying like 30 dollars per user? Yeah. Okay. OK, perfect. So, I will, I'll follow up with more information after this, and then, you know, if there's more interest to set up a trial, we can set that up, but I appreciate the time today, team and, I will talk to you all soon.

Cecelia Hull (c.hull@bws-logistics.com):
  Thank you. Happy.

Craig Allan (c.allan@bws-logistics.com):
  New year. All.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Happy new year. Take care. Bye.
