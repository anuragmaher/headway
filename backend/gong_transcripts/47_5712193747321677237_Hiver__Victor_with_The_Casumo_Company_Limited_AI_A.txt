================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Bojan, can you hear me?

Bojan Kolevski (bojan.kolevski@casumo.com):
  Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I can hear you loud and clear how's it going today?

Bojan Kolevski (bojan.kolevski@casumo.com):
  Good, good. How are you? Everything good?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm good. Just dealing with a bit of the random flu that supposedly is flying around across the world. So, I'm just going to keep video off if that's okay, but otherwise, fine.

Bojan Kolevski (bojan.kolevski@casumo.com):
  Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. No worries.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant, man. Bojan, Eric from my team will be joining us shortly. I realize we've also got a couple of other people from the casumo side on the call. Any idea if they'll be joining us as well?

Bojan Kolevski (bojan.kolevski@casumo.com):
  Yeah, Victor will be joining us soon. I just want to call him. He said he's going to just bring up a cup of coffee, and he's going to be joining us soon. I'm going to send him a message if he doesn't show up in a couple of seconds.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. No worries. Yeah, that's.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I've got somebody in the waiting room that we wrote, which is here… there we go. That's Victor and Eric's in as well. All right, sweet. We've got a full house. Excuse me. Hey, Victor. How's it going?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hey, what's up guys… Victor, can you hear us?

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  Yeah. Can you hear me?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Now we can, yes. All right. We're good to go that's full house. Is there anybody else from the casumo side we're expecting?

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  No, no, just me and Bojan.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Brilliant. All right. Okay, folks.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, it looks like we have the call scheduled because you wanted to learn about the AI feature set on hiver. I noticed you've shown interest in the co pilot, the sentiment and the AI tagging. So, before I jump into the whole demo mode and showcase what these feature sets look like. I wanted to kick us off by understanding what your expectations are, if they are heading into the AI discussion with hiver.

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  Well, it's not purely high expectations or, you know, it's just to see what is the potential because it is true that we use hiver and you know, Bojan is with us because he's the person that is taking care of this inbox from our team. So, I mean, since he's you know, monitoring the inbox and so on tagging according to what we believe is our needs and so on. He's… doing that. But, you know, you never know what is the potential of any futures, you know, and if there is any implementation that we could think about or we can implement in our daily basis? Because I mean it's always, you know, welcome to learn new things and new easy ways to work at the end of the day.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, perfect. Victor, that makes sense. So, yeah. So let me give you all like a quick high level overview in terms of the AI capabilities on hiver, we've got like three to five major features or perspectives of AI that's already launched and have been adopted pretty widely by our customers. And I've got like an early figma for one of the prototypes that we're building slated for launch next week or we can talk about future plans on the AI roadmap for hiver as well. Firstly, can you all see my screen? All right, perfect. So from the AI perspective on hiver, we're effectively taking a two category approach broad stroke when it comes to the AI development and the feature set in itself. One of that we call it the AI agent route and that's where AI tagging sentiment analysis and thank you detectors are the three main features at this point rolled into that perspective of things. The AI agents are going to be meant from a perspective of doing in future, obviously all of the work. But at this point, helping you achieve a place where you're able to confidently rely on AI taking part and taking the lead on some of the operational stuff when it comes to managing your emails and your entire inbox experience. AI co pilot on the other hand is where things start taking a turn for making things better on the customer facing side of things. So these are the emails that go out to the people you interact with as a team, right? And so over there we've got the compose and the summarizer, which is more for the people in your team, the representatives in terms of making it easier for them to write, making sure that when you're looking at things, you've got a better context and quick summaries. And the whole perspective and ask AI is the hybrid version? Yes, please go ahead.

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  No.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, sorry. Don't worry. Thank you. We've got a sensitive mic. So, yeah. So the ask AI is pretty much the way where hiver is effectively giving you an AI bot if I can call it that, which pretty much helps your team members answer, respond and send out emails faster and quicker by not having to look at 20 different places to find the relevant information that's needed, right? So now starting to dig deep into every single one individually. AI tagging is pretty much hiver's way of allowing your team to train the AI model that we've got on automatically applying tags and categorizing them. And this is a significant departure compared to how things work so far on hiver and that's purely based on keyword based workflows or automations. For instance, you say, hey, if the email's got the word refund, you add the refund tag, right? If it's got billing errors, you add the billing tag. So taking a departure from there, our AI model with the tagging perspective, what it would do, it's pretty much starts learning by your team's initial training. So in this model, what you'll do is you'll basically give hiver the list of tags that you'd want the AI to start taking the lead on and from a training perspective, because it has to be accurate in the long run, your team has full control into what hiver's AI tags, as in this case, customer support. And that training happens by your team manually adding 10 conversations that you feel cover the breadth and the scope of the meaning of customer support in your scenario. Now, other examples where customers have used this pretty effectively is when it comes to non standard conversations, like for instance, refund for example, can be written 10 different ways by 10 different customers sometimes without the word refund. So that's like a real quick example of how the AI tagging could then take the lead here. And what essentially happens here is your team feeds 10 emails to the AI model. The model then summarizes that learns from it. And then tells you, hey, this is my perspective of a prompt that would effectively classify emails as refund in the scenario of your business in your use case. So the way your team works and the kind of interactions you have, the AI model will tell you, hey, I feel this tag needs to be applied when something cannot be done, immediately, needs to be tracked for future action or needs to be escalated to other departments. Now, in terms of flexibility, once the training is completed, your team also has full control in terms of prompt engineering. So if you want to add more specifics here instead of going through emails and trying to fit that in. If you feel like, hey, I just know five other terms or five other phrases that my customers use. Put that in here. Save the changes. And that way you can keep tweaking this as it goes forward in the real world scenario or in an everyday perspective. The way this works is once you've enabled it, after training is done, the hiver's AI would effectively start adding these tags. Meaning these emails are automatically categorized by default. So the moment your team inbox gets an email, if content on that email resonates with the AI tagging prompt and the mechanism there, it'll automatically add that tag. So now you no longer have to rely on specific keywords and wording matches and verbiage matches there. It's more spread out. It costs a wider net making it easier for you to drive better categorization. And as a next step of this, obviously through the automations that you've already got, you can be like, hey, if tag one is added, do these steps, notify Bojan, reassign it to somebody, mark it as high priority. That becomes more effective. Because now you've got a more wider space that you can work with as opposed to just, you know, keywords that are more direct in that nature of things. So that's the AI tagging side of stuff, right? It's more for replacement for the tags where a direct match or specific exact keyword based mechanism will not be sufficient. The second one there that I showed you was the AI sentiment, right? And what that does is it basically starts giving your team members needle emojis that pretty much tell you the sentiment of the conversation as it comes into your inbox, right? It's got a three point and a five point scale. I see the smile on your face right there. Everybody starts liking the emojis as they show up. And effectively, what it does is based on the tonality, the verbiage and just the general trail mail. If there's more than two messages, it's able to predict and tell you, hey, we feel this is a neutral conversation. This one's negative. So it's very negative, positive. Very positive. Now, the advantage of the sentiment piece is that it's not a one time thing. It doesn't just land on the first email and tell you, hey, this one's bad. It actually tracks it progressively. So, the first email was negative. And then by the third email of Bojan's, done a crazy job and the customer is positive. At that point, you're going to be able to track that entire life cycle and that's what the current at the beginning difference is there for, right? You're going to have reporting and everything built out for this as well. You've already got reporting that tells you, hey, this is what the sentiment is like and that fits neatly within our reporting space or analytics. This little one here tells you, hey, these are your open conversations. These are the sentiments for these open conversations. And then from there, obviously, you can drill down, see what that's like and if needed even set up automations, like some businesses are like, hey, if somebody is negative, very negative. I want an email going out from the manager just saying, hey, you know what? I'm the manager, I want to help you out here. Reach out to me directly. If there's anything on the other side if something's positive, very positive. Send out a note saying, hey, we love that. You've got a very positive experience. Why don't you leave us a review that's been like, you know, one of the examples we have within our customer base, right? So that's how the sentiment analysis plays into picture. And just like the tagging, this could also be used as part of your automation workflows. Now, with both of this set, I want to take a quick pause to see if these two between themselves have any kind of resonance in your workflows. You see yourself using any of these?

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  Yeah. Well, I don't know if you remember, but basically, we work in the finance department of one company and basically all the billing related stuff is coming to our inbox. So incoming invoices payment status, you know, follow ups on tickets or urgent payments or all this kind of stuff. So it is not related to customer service itself. You know, for the, you know, the happy faces and so on. But yeah, I mean, for example, if we have, you know, for example, the problem. Also, I don't know how hiver would interact with multiple languages because for example, Bojan is from Macedonia and in Macedonia, they speak in Macedonian obviously. But this is the cyrillic alphabet. It's not the latin alphabet. So, for example, if the attachment has the word invoice or what is factura for the language? You know, or in Spanish? Also that we have Spanish customers, which is also factura, you know, but factura in latin alphabet or latin alphabet or cyrillic alphabet to be tagged as, you know, invoice can be booked. However, for example, if it is a statement on an account request for payment… and all these kind of things is something that we need to follow up. It's not urgent action, you know. So I don't know how, we can, you know, first of all, teach… hiver to understand several languages at the same time. And secondly to read what is inside of the PDF. You know what I mean?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, no, I get where you're coming from. So the one thing I can tell you is we've done testing on multilingual support in terms of different languages with some of our customers. And so far it's had a good success ratio. I'm not gonna say it's 100 percent there and 100 percent accurate. But from what we've seen, we've got good signs of success. We've got good signs of early advantages there. And just like with any AI model, it gets better with time and with specific nuance based training. So with a little bit of prompt engineering, I'm sure at least the tagging perspective of things would definitely start, you know, getting better. And the other thing I wanna mention is that the next piece of things, you know, is something called an AI extract that we've got. So in your perspective, you said that, you know, because you pretty much deal with like, excuse me, pretty much deal with like invoice numbers and payment reminders, donning mechanisms, things like that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For instance, if the invoice number is gonna make Bojan's life easier when he wants to handle a ticket, then you can pretty much have a workflow in hiver set up that says, hey, whenever an email comes in, check the email. And if it's got an invoice number that follows inv, hyphen, you know, basically a pattern, tell that pattern and it will be able to extract that invoice number, put it into a separate field here. At least at an overview level, you get that data out of the email. So you don't have to go through the entire thread just to get that information, right? So that extracting piece could then be there based on which you can look at maybe automating some of the workflows on hiver that's one way to start about it.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Vicky, I have a question. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Go ahead. I thought you were done. I just wanted to touch on the languages real quick. So it sounds like we have a number of emails coming in different languages. Are those all coming into the same inbox? And then how is your team currently doing? How do you look at those to know this is in Spanish. This is in Macedonian, send it to Bojan. Are you manually just looking at every email? And then based on the language, you'll send it to the proper teammate?

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  Yeah, because we all do have, yeah, go. ahead. Go ahead.

Bojan Kolevski (bojan.kolevski@casumo.com):
  Yeah, we all do have an access to that inbox. So we usually if it's a different language and I cannot understand it. I just like talk to Victor or another teammate who is in Spanish in the hiver on the side like as a comment. And then we go from there. But basically, we all do receive all of the invoice from this different language in the same inbox and we handle it from there.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then you have team members that handle certain languages, obviously?

Bojan Kolevski (bojan.kolevski@casumo.com):
  Exactly. Yeah.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  I'm wondering and there's something Raghav and I can talk about, but I'm wondering if there's an opportunity here for using AI tagging for language specificity, and then maybe being able to power workflows, say if this is a Spanish email, automatically assign it to Victor or the team members that can handle Spanish languages?

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  Yeah. Well, the thing is that we don't receive a crazy amount of emails on a regular basis. How many emails we can get? I don't know between 30 and 50, something like that. So, I mean, it is not impossible to go through, you know, in an eight hour shift, it is not a problem but, you know, for the automatic tagging is like, yes, because I mean instead of going through all these 50 emails, you know, in the morning and it's like, okay, those are automatically tagged as invoices. So we know that it is immediate action that, you know, it is the, for example emails that are the first time that we get, it is not an email chain going, you know, back and forth with answers and questions and so on. But, you know, first email from a chain received, you know, and it says that attaching the invoice or, you know, something related to invoice factura or payment automatically tagged it as, you know, so we understand that it is urgent. However, you know, all this, that is what is happening in our confluence page and so on is like, it is not urgent. It is, you know, we call it a spam because at the end of the day, it's not something related to our work. It is something that it says something, you know, but I mean our email address is in many sites just in order to be able to access, you know, to some back offices. So this is why we get, you know, many newsletters from suppliers, but it doesn't mean that we need to prioritize these tickets. We do it in a manual way, you know, I mean, but it's not the end of the day. It's not the end of the world. Also, for example, there are some receipts or invoices that are related to credit card payments. And those ones we don't need immediate action, but, you know, we do it at the end of the month and so on. So we were just wondering, you know, the potential and the facilities that this AI tagging could give us, you know, in order to make our life a bit easier, you know, but it is not that we need to cope with thousands of emails on a daily basis. Not at all. Not at all. It's something that, you know, I mean, this number of people you know, that you have in your left column, like Aditya Alexander. So this is the number of people that we have in our team and we have to deal with. I don't know three emails per day or something like that. It's not that big really. And there is a person that takes care, you know, this particular. Week of the inbox, you know, we are rotating the task and so on, you know, but the tagging is always the same, you know, if it is something paid with a credit card, we put the credit card, if it is a request for payment. So something that needs to be paid and it is not an actual invoice that needs to be pre approved, but we need for example, to send money for a deposit of something or something like that. You know, we tag it in a different way and this is, you know, what we were after, but I guess it is a matter of just playing around with the taggings of the copilot and on automatic tagging and so on and see if it starts working.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly. No, that's completely accurate. Victor. At this point, you know, looking at the nuances and grammar specificity of different languages and how they work, it will require some bit of experimentation and just a little bit of tweaking on your end. But from a general multilingual capability on both the copilot and the tagging piece of things, we've heard good news there's been, we've been able to make like quick modifications adaptions to the way the AI reads perspectives on like languages. So, I'm confident that it would be able to handle those things and reduce your workload, you know, when it comes to tagging as well. And I appreciate that you led me to the next part which is the copilot piece as a whole. And, you know, that piece pretty much, you know, sits right inside of every email on the right panel. Get this little sparkle icon on the bottom right? That's the ask AI or copilot as we call it right now. What it does is it basically gives you the ability to one upload your knowledge sources. And when I say knowledge sources, I'm talking about documents. I'm talking about PDF files… excuse me, anything and everything that you feel your team would need to have access to. When it comes to addressing the questions on the email, it could be what's your refund policy? What's your payment terms? You know, starting with something as basic as that, all the way to as complicated as it might get depending on geographies that you deal with. Now, at this stage, we've got the option for you to add both snippets which are like short form articles and things like that, or entire documents, PDFS, text files, doc X, and the whole lot in. I think in the coming two to three weeks, I'll check with my team for an exact timeline. We're gonna be launching out support for both confluence and notion as part of the roadmap. I just wanted to check where does your base of knowledge exist? Like where do your sops and processes, things like that stay?

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm sorry here. Okay. Well, I think I've got to hit up musk and get him access to neural networks to get that out. But honestly, do you have it anywhere else? Like on a document, Google drive, something like that?

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  We used to have, you know, process documentation, some word notes in a finance folder, some others in confluence. I mean, it's not in the same place, everything you know. And I mean at the end of the day, we have some things that is either too repetitive that after two weeks doing the same is always the same and you cannot base on an example because every invoice is, you know, has something different, you know, different payment terms, different amounts, different currencies, and so on. But at the end of the day, they are all the same, you know, so you prepare a manual or something that, you know is very good for the start, you know. But after two weeks, it's like where.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  does it go?

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  You don't need to go to the manual, never again. And there are some other things that we do just once per month or something like that. That the person who does it is like, okay, let me do it my way and there is no need to document it, you know, as long as this person knows what he's doing. So for sure, we are not very good at documenting things.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. No, I mean, quite honestly, I've tried documenting a lot of things in my past life as well and I get how difficult it gets to put it in a very nice way of things, you know. But with the co pilot, you know, what it can do is not just rely on these documents and these files and everything that you've got split out across confluence and all these places. Through the snippet perspective, you could even have smaller things like you said, you know, one person does it a certain way and they're like, hey, I know this is a way that it works. It's very particular to how my style of working is, but I know it's going to get the job done. So if you're able to like understand things like that instead of letting that process or that idea stay siloed with that one person I'd suggest maybe try adding it in a snippet instead. So that way it becomes part of the central team's knowledge or in this case, the co pilot's knowledge. So the next time a similar email lands in the inbox for your team, the next person that might not be the same Guy, can still get that data and still get the way of doing it. So effectively, what the co pilot does is basically scan the emails that you receive. And when I scan, when I say scan, basically understand the email that is being received. You've got two things you can do right off the bat. One is either summarize, and that gives you like a clear understanding of questions. Asks next steps depending on the data that it has. In this case, Victor, if we can tie it to your brain, then it's probably going to give you everything. And so essentially, you know, it tells you, okay, this is the status. This is the next steps. This is what we think would be the best route of going about it. And then from there, if you say, hey, you want to draft a reply, just say draft a reply, right? And what it will do is again reliant on the information and the knowledge it has access to it's. Not just going to tell you, hey, this might be the right way, but will actually give you that entire answer, incorporating all of that. So if country one's process for payment terms are dependent, I mean different from country twos, then you can get the co pilot to pretty much give you that information with as detailed of accuracy as you need. We've done pretty extensive testing on the co pilot piece especially with regards to drafting answers. You can be a little more conversational here and you're like, hey include. Refund process, for example, I'm not sure if we've got a refund document here, but if we did or a snippet here, but if we did it's going to incorporate that, make it better. And so in the long term, what we are hoping to have the co pilot do is have pre drafted answers ready to send for your team members in one click. At this point, we're giving you as the business full control on how the experience is like. So that way you get to train it, you know, what it's like and what information goes long term. We're looking at it, giving you a draft ready to that says this context, this bit of information, this is what the AI feels is going to be the best answer. And then your team can fine tune it if it needs, feed it back to the co pilot through this button at one email level. So again, Victor to your point, one person does something different, it works great that can then become a knowledge source that the whole team can start leveraging to make life easier, right? So that's what we're looking at incorporating AI in the general sense of it making things better. Now, we're continually improving the learning and the experience as the outcome. So, what I'd suggest at this point is, you know, with that and I realize we're at time as well. So with that, those were the three key elements of the hiver AI piece that I wanted to chat about. The fourth one that we're pretty much talking about. I'll just give you a quick third second on that as the whole AI QA perspective. Now, this one's more from an angle where as a team, you're able to have that quality analysis check in place. So for instance, if you want your agent helping you on compose, you can be like, hey, you know, your agent can just type this out and the QA can be like make it professional, give you suggestions basically making it easier for your team to just type out something that they think will be right straight off the bat and the QA aspect of things can pretty much start to make things easier. New emails as you're writing replies, the whole angle of it then pretty much go from there, right? So that's an early figma, mock that I'm showing you. So it's more of a prototype at this stage in terms of what it's going to shape up like. But we do have this later for launch in the next couple of weeks as well. So as we keep developing on this, we'll be sure to hit you up there's going to be reporting there's. Going to be a whole admin console for this. And so, yeah, with that said, that's the general teams of which we're approaching the AI suite on hiver in terms of features. So as next steps, what I'd like to do is have your team trial these features like you said, Victor and Bojan, see if they are useful, especially the tagging and the co pilot, I feel could be useful because a lot of finance teams have found it useful, start trialing that additional clarity is the whole AI suite will be a paid add on over and above your subscription in itself. So what I'll do is I'll send over information on all the different pieces that we discussed about, right? You can check it out, find out where to enable it and start testing them. Let's have a touch base called scheduled for maybe two weeks from now so we can discuss what the outcomes are, what improvements would help your team? And if it makes sense, start discussing commercials and go from there. Yeah.

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  Sounds good. Send us over, you know, the recording of the video or the material that you have and we, you know, because our time is also limited. So we need to start, you know, checking things, you know, but all these things, you know, for example, if they continue with Bojan, if Bojan, you know, on a regular basis when he's coming in the morning is like going through the emails and tagging, you know, maybe we can start, you know, using this AI for the tagging. Yeah, I mean, maybe saving, some answers for the payment terms, as you said, and all these things. And, you know, let's see if we can get advantage for this future. That's great.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  To hear, I love that you're open to exploring this further and seeing how it can make life easier for the both of you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So before we drop off for today, I was just going to check if the same time the same time, just a quick follow up call if needed. We can move it now.

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  I don't know if I will be on holidays, probably, yes, probably not. But, but then we can schedule on the, you are going to be working, right? Boyan?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  So he's because, I need to take one week off and I don't know if it is going to be that week or the following one. So. All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Well, hey, I'd like to plan your vacation in advance, Boyan. I'll just put that in as a tentative time being.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We can always move it around depending on schedules and, yeah, look for my email recording details and everything. I'd like for you to start exploring this. Keep an open communication channel. So, any questions along the way, write an email to me and Eric, and we'll take it from there. Yeah.

Victor Caton Porqueras (victor.catonporqueras@casumo.com):
  Sounds good. Very good. Thank you so much guys.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thank you so much. Thank you really.
