Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  hey, gallem. Hey.

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  How are you?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Sorry for being late.

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  No, no worries. I.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Went to log into my computer and it was, of course, asking, it had done some sort of update. So then it was asking for like a 17,000 letter string of, I mean, string of numbers and letters and I was like, ah.

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  Yeah, I… had a similar issue. I just got a new machine last week and I've had to like log into everything again. And yeah, it's been, and then, yeah, it can be annoying.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yes, very annoying. And it always does it at the most like inconvenient times, you know, it's like really right now that's what you, that's what we're going to do. Okay? This shouldn't be long. I do just want to, I'm just, I'm sad we didn't get the RFP, but I was… not super surprised just because I think we are like lacking some of the features right now that you know, they were looking for. Are you, do you know what they ended up going with?

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  I don't as of yet? No, I know it's not freshservice. But yeah, I know it's not okay. But yeah, I've not really been close to it. So, I've kind of been, yeah, focused on other areas, but who's to say in a year or two once you guys improve functionality and, get those things that we're asking for that, we don't make that switch. So.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. We.

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  run these, we run these tenders pretty often. So it's oh,

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  really? Yeah.

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  Yeah, to look at market, you know, obviously, there's a lot in the next couple of years, you know, AI is obviously improving massively so, it's you know, we will be running these fairly often, okay?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, there isn't any chance that like I guess in the next let's look at when your renewal is actually.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. Third.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  September fourteenth of next year, is there any chance come next year that?

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  You would, yeah, potentially? Okay, we would probably be going through the same process again, some point next year for?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  The current teams that are on hiver, or do you think that there would be a chance that you would move the rest of the teams off?

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  No, I don't think so. Just because hiver is its own unique, okay toolset that is used by legal and compliance. So, yeah, I would imagine that's a different. Yeah, I mean, what we're looking to replace freshservice with is mainly for what people are using freshservice for now. Yeah, hiver's got its own unique use case for legal and compliance. So.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. Good to know. My other question was around AI. So actually, the compliance team I've been talking to Simran a little bit about her AI add on. She's been exploring sentiment analysis and tag auto tagging. And if there were, if she were like ready to move forward and she wanted to purchase the AI package, what would the process be for that? Would you be the person I would need to work with?

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  Yes. Okay. Yeah. How much is it, what's the cost to be fair? It's the first I've heard of it. So it's like, yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, that's why I'm bringing it up today. I don't even know. I mean we haven't gotten to like a pricing conversation with her either. I think she's still sort of trialing the features and needs to figure out how valuable they are for her. But if we did start that conversation, the pricing starts at 20 dollars per user.

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  Per month.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  I think let's see, let me double check other places here.

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  So it looks.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  like right now you're at… yeah. So it's going on quite a bit… that all being said, well, but then it says 47 here. I hate the way this stuff is organized. Let me log into your instance, that'll give us a better more… exact.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  And we can obviously like negotiate from there. I mean, we would rather it be available and valuable and adding value, you know, then you be price blocked and the team can't use it. You know, that doesn't really make any sense. So we can definitely negotiate on the pricing… that's just the starting price.

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  I think from our side, I mean, just doing a couple of calculations. It's an extra 17,000 dollars, which isn't in the budget. Yeah. So it would definitely have to go through sort of an internal process on our side which seamran would have to run. Okay. Yeah, explaining added value sort of return on investment. You know, what is that additional 1,717 K providing to us as a business? But, yeah, I mean, I can work with seamran on that. Okay?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  It's at 70, you're at 72, but I think one person has been invited but isn't using it yet. So, yeah. So you're at 72 right now? Okay. I have my next meeting with seamran, I think next week?

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  Yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Next Wednesday, the last couple of meetings we haven't been able to connect so hopefully she can come to that one and we can restart the conversation because it's been a while since we originally talked about it.

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's all. I had anything on your agenda?

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  Nothing on my agenda to be fair, I think, yeah, I mean, no issues on our side, I think so. You're keeping contact with seamran who's sort of the main user of the tool. So, yeah, all good, my side.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Thank you. We'll keep you posted.

Calum Mckenna (calum.mckenna@thirdbridge.com):
  Yeah, cool. Cheers. All right.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Have a good one. Bye.
