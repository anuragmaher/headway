================================================================================

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sebastian, hi, can you hear me?

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yep. Perfect. I can hear you now. How are you doing?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hi, Sebastian. How are you doing today?

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  I'm doing good. How about you?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Good. Thanks for asking. Firstly before we get started, it's just going to be the both of us or are we expecting anybody else to jump in?

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  So it's just going to be the both of us for today. I'm going to explain the email. This is kind of just to see if this is a potential solution right now. We're taking a look at a few different options. I'm going through it right now, you kind of managed some of the it stuff that we do at the firm. And then if this seems like it's an option for us, then I'll kind of bring in the operations managers and everything like that just to see if it will work exactly for our team?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sounds like a plan. Sounds good. Thanks for the context. I want to make the best use of our time together. So I'll do a quick introduction, set an agenda and we can dive straight in. My name is Jeevan. I currently lead our team here at hiver. I've been with the business for over seven years and during this time, I've worked with some of our largest customers, many of whom are in the logistics trucking transportation space. So we've got a lot of three PLS using hiver for very high volume operations, arrived logistics flexport, and just like many more regional three PLS as well. So my objective is definitely to show you what we've got set up for us. Secondly, what we'd also do is actually get in touch and actually show you how the product works, answer any specific questions that you might have. And like you said, it makes sense that we can do the same thing. And maybe more specifically for the larger team. Perfect. So I do have a presentation lined up and I'm happy to run into that before that. I just want to quickly summarize what I know so far and maybe dive into this a little bit more, right? So, Sebastian… would you mention that you actually have one central point of intake for your operations department? You've used some sort of delegation labels filtering to sort of streamline that, but you're still running into certain issues and you're looking for a better system to sort of put on top of this to make this whole process a whole lot easier?

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah, that's basically it. So we have one email that's kind of our main point of contact with customers, potential customers and all that stuff. So that's basically outside communication kind of goes through this point. Sure. Then we have kind of more internal stuff, but that's kind of the main focus right now. And because of just the nature of the business and what we do, we have hundreds of loads every single day and there might be a couple emails for one of those loads. And then another one might have 10 20 emails for those. And then we have a bunch more coming in that are potential loads. So over the course of the day, we're dealing with thousands. We're getting emails almost every minute during the workday a little bit less during the off hours. But we still do have people working there, right? So we have a bunch of people that need to have access to this email, use it to communicate going out. And yeah, as our team has kind of expanded, we've been running into a bunch of different issues with that… basically just from volume is from my understanding when I spoke with Google and when I've taken a look around, it seems like we just have too many users that are trying to access one email possibly with sending too many out. I don't think that's the direct issue just because we have some of the business plans for Google or whatever and I don't think we hit any of those limits. I think it's just too many people coming in.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Shared logins. We see this all the time and people, let me guess as new people are logging in, older people get logged out. And then that just,

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  yeah. Sometimes like that, we've used delegation which made it better for some time. But again, we've been growing. So just having more and more volume in it, we have a bunch of different filters stuff that gets auto tagged into the different ones. For example, we have different teams. So if we get an email from a certain customer, it comes into our mailbox, and then it's going to go over to team one. It's going to have a little tag there, right? Something else comes to from a different customer. It's going to go into team two. And then whatnot, and then we also use.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, go ahead and.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Then we also use forwarding to kind of make sure that stuff doesn't get too locked. So there's some people that some of the managers that they're not responding to every single email or whatnot, but it would be nice for them to have kind of access to it so they could search it up or anything like that. So we every email that kind of comes in, we forward it off to a couple more of our internal inboxes. So we have it there. And then it, you know, usually it goes straight into their archive or anything like that. So they're able to be like, okay, you know, what somebody was talking to me about. Load number one one one, for example, they could just control F, you know, search in the email, see the email thread for that, even if they wouldn't normally be involved. Yeah. So that's kind of the current set we have. But yeah, we just, we're getting issues where people aren't able to log in even through the delegation. There's periods of times where we essentially have a blackout where we're not allowed sending emails for, you know, 15, 20 minutes. We.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Have eight limits.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah. So just kind of like that.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. As you were going through that honestly, I had so many different ideas with you mentioned like load numbers. So we've got like so much AI that we can explore with that. But yeah, I think that's really helpful before I jump in anything else that you'd consider. So just to summarize what I've heard so far first and foremost, I think that's the first challenge that we actually solve just by the nature of how our architecture, is just being able to clear up the whole volume aspect. Having people log in directly. We solve that first and foremost from the base nature of how we're set up that's number one. And then number two, we've got just people not having the kind of streamlined access you're forwarding stuff you're putting into labels, but that's not really doing what it needs to do, basically putting some real organizational elements in that. And number three, just being able to like give like leadership access to things that they need without them having to read through hundreds of emails.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we have some sort of tagging system where like I said, it goes into the different teams. So the primary thing that we need right now is just make sure that we're not having issues within the thing like everybody's able to access it. If we can't get a better like tagging or ticket system. Essentially that would be, that would be welcome as well. But the primary thing that we're looking at is just making sure that everything has got to go. Again, there's no, right. There's no volume issues there.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  There's no people getting logged out. Yeah. And on that note, I'm just going to jump in because I'd love to sort of build on this with you. So let's ask the first reason why we have so many three PL companies using us over the years. And if you take our top 25 accounts, I'd say at least two or three of them are three PL, right? Right? So essentially, what we want to do is allow people to make one fundamental change which is no longer having to need delegation, no longer having to do shared logins. You don't need to access that central source main inbox ever again, right? All people need to do is step out of that source inbox and step into their individual inboxes, which is where I've logged in. This is my account, my inbox and my inbox on top over here on the top left gets emails addressed to me. No changes with that. Whatsoever. What hiver does is we connect to that source, the main inbox, we connect to that through a folder like this on the left. Let me just like change my screen. Just give me a second.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Sure.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sorry. Yeah. So many strings. There we go, right? So we connect to folder to connect that main inbox to a folder like this. On the left. We currently have three such folders starting with finance operations and support each of these folders. Sebastian can be connected to an actual Gmail account. They can be even connected to a group email address if required down the line. So we have no restrictions. We connect to both options equally with no changes. So once an email is, once an email is connected to such a folder like this all. So once an email address is connected to a folder like this, all subsequent emails sent to that email address will become will come into this shared environment for me. And for other 20 30 40 50, we've got customers that have 203 100 people in one mailbox.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah. So this is a subset of the greater inbox.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It is not a subset. I'll tell you exactly what it is. Okay. So we are connecting to that inbox because we're a certified Google partner.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  We.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  use oauth, Google's oauth, to connect into the, to authenticate and get access to.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  This, oh, so this would be essentially the support at whatever email for example.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, this support is my support at hiver, helpdesk, on your case, it will be that one. Okay. So what we do is when an email comes into that, we're not really like giving people access directly to their account, we are copying, making copies of that email and sending it to each individual user, and then we're giving them our apis to stay on track and all the functionality that they want to see.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So what that does is it removes load on the source account. You don't need to nobody. Not a single person needs password to it. First of all, with hiver, secondly, it takes the load off of it in the sense that the sending and receiving of emails now are all done from individual inboxes. So it's spread out and the volume and the traffic is spread out rather than it being concentrated in one account. So, all of these rate limits that you're probably seeing it's something that we hear all the time that goes out the window just by the nature of how we're set up… right? And I know you said that's the important piece. Any questions so far?

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Okay. So the idea would be that every single email that comes into the, to the support, it would show up in this folder over here. Yes. And then they would have full access to that stuff. And then just because of the volume that we're talking about, we're probably going to have to find a way to tag these, you know, create a signs and everything like that. Is that correct?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. Absolutely. So, let's talk about that. Now, we've spoken about access now, let's talk about functionality. Now with functionality. So our objective, our theme that you're going to see over the next, this call or the next call is that, can we understand enough about your business and help you set up all of these automated workflows? That can do all of these additional internal admin steps before a human being ever gets there? Now, what are those admin steps, right? So it starts with our AI kicking in first, of course, you can choose to use it or not. But if you choose to use it, our AI will kick in first, we'll process that email and we'll start doing a few things on it. Number one, it first and foremost detects sentiment, right? So it will detect whether there is a frustrated conversation somewhere, whether there's a frustrated customer interaction happening somewhere. And based on that sentiment interaction, you can automatically set escalation protocols and escalation workflows to send an email out, saying the apologies for your experience. We're getting our best people on the job. So you are able to trigger an email, do all of that automatically. And I'm going to, show that to you in a second. But essentially, what our AI is doing is reading it. And then on the right, it can also start categorizing these emails as well, right? So it can start automatically adding tags to it, right? Number one, number two, Sebastian, is you actually, what hiver allows you to do is on the back end create something called a custom object where if you have a list of associations that says, hey email, these 10 customers go to team one. These 10 customers go to team two. If you give us that repository of information, we can help you upload that information to a table like this. And we can use the associations in this table to automatically route emails as well… right? So, for example, if an email comes in from Amazon, I know that the owner of that email is Eric and the tag that needs to get added is Amazon. Now, I have fed this information to the system and you can set up workflows based on the associations here, right? So the idea Sebastian is when an email comes in, it gets the sentiment is detected, the categories are automatically assigned based on billing, refund, request, whatever that is. So our AI can read the email, can automatically tag it for you. You can also get stuff like this where you can get a ticket summary or an extraction where it extracts the name, the load number from that email and automatically puts it in there. So you can go in and search. For that load number and see all the emails with that load number. So we can extract that for you. And we also allow you to assign it to the right team by automatically putting it in right here, right? So for example, this is the way to manually do it, but you can automatically do it as well. Let's say I'm going to assign this to my team member Cole.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Right.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Now, as far as Cole is concerned, he's just come in. He's getting on to his day by the time he reaches office and he logs in, all he has to do is click on the mind section over here. So Cole, his focus is only on the mind section. So what he needs to do is essentially make sure that everything here is taken care of because these are all the currently active emails that are assigned to him. Cole can come in here. This email might be automatically assigned to him automatically tagged. We'll have an AI extraction. We'll have a due date if required. Just like this. It says due date due by the 20 eighth November at eight or five PM. All of these steps are done before a human being comes there. Then Cole can come in and start replying to it. Okay? I'll hit pause any questions so far?

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  So the question I have here, so it looks like it could be able to do quite a few things and the exact details of what the AI could do that could probably wait until, you know, a further meeting for something like that. The thing that I want to talk about right now is we usually have… when we want to assign something, sometimes we want to assign it to multiple people, right? Just because we have shifts, let's say we have group number one, we might have three people working on group number one. At this moment, at this moment, let's say one shift is three of them, and then there might be three on the next shift.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  In group number one?

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah. Let's say group number one, they have three people working on it, the morning shift, three people working on it, the afternoon shift and two people working on it overnight. For example, I think that's roughly what the numbers are. I want to make sure that, you know, everybody that sees that it's supposed to be theirs. They're going to be able to see it. And then especially when the shift changes and stuff like that, I want people to be able to pick up exactly where it's left off, right? To be able to take a look, be like, okay, this is what's happened continue and then not to have any issues with something like that.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, these are all the ideas that I was rumbling about when you were walking me through it, right? The reason why the success that we've had is because we've managed the whole like transfer of control between shifts between people as well. And so the easiest and the most effective way to do this is this, so bear with me, right? First things first, we want to create a bunch of tags. So these tags don't belong to any one individual person, they belong to the inbox. So in this case, I'm going to say, I'm going to create a tag. This is how I create a tag. I'm going to say group one in this case because it is just an internal classification. There is no way for me to give a AI description. But if I do want to give, for example, explain when to use this tag and then I can sort of like train it with a few examples. Hiver can pick it up. But in this case, I'm not going to use the AI. I'm just going to simply create a tag called group one. Now, what I want to do is then go into the admin panel and this is where a lot of the things that we're talking about really comes through, right? I want to go to the admin panel. Either I can either sort… of assign customer emails to group one based on whether the customer domain or the customer organization is part of that list. That can be, that can, like I said, can be picked up from an association table like this or you can set up a rule, right? So let me set up a rule now for us as you can tell inside each mailbox, there are a lot of different features there's the AI that we can talk about. There is the slas, customer satisfaction surveys. So a lot of this we can definitely dig into. But for the interest of time, I want to click into automations and say, click on create automation. I want to say create from scratch. So I want to say, whenever a conversation comes in and if, when that conversation comes in, if the domain is present in the association that I had, right? Or, or I don't want to do that, I can just say from email contains any of let's say the three clients in group one are Adidas. Com, Nike. Com, you might have come, right? So whenever emails come in from these three people, I wanted to automatically be assigned to that group one tag. So how can I do that? I can automatically add a tag that says group one here, click apply or you can also do additional actions, multiple actions, which is you can assign it to someone you can. Assign it among a smaller group of people. You can send a reply. You can add a note, notification, update, priority, a lot of different stuff. But again, for the sake of this example, we will stick it to this. So it says when the first email of a conversation is received in the support inbox, if the sender's address contains any of the defined group of values, then add the tag group one to the conversation that's what this automation does. We give you a quick AI summary as well. Now, let's say I want to save and enable this from this point on. All emails coming in from the requested accounts in group one will be here. Now, what I can do is then go in here and create a folder, a sub folder just for group one. I can click add. I want to say, hey, I want to see all open and pending. And this is actually really important, right? Because this allows me to go in and make this a sort of a dynamic view. So we'll talk about the statuses in a second. But essentially in this dynamic view, I want to click apply. And now all the emails that ever fall under this category which is open or pending with group one will be visible here. I can save this for all the members saying group one and I can click save. And the best part of this is anytime I click save, I see all of these favorite views over here. I don't care about pending or closed. So I'm going to replace that with group one by just hitting the hollow star next to it. And this selection of starred views is independent to each user. So if I am part of group one.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah, favorites tab, essentially, right?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It's your favorites tab. So I can start group one, I can pull it to the top because that's all I care about. But if someone else is in group two, they can start group two, and we can help you set this up.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah, I.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  hope that answered your question. It's something as you can tell, very common and very popular with our customers, this little structure. But I'm happy to answer any questions.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah. So that seems like it would be able to, it's fairly similar to the system we're currently using, right? We have the filter set up in our Gmail. If it comes from specific domains, it just gets automatically hits with the tag and then it shows up on a little box on the left similar to this… because obviously… it's a, one of the big things is obviously getting everything in without the issues. The other thing that we want to make sure is still possible and possibly to improve on is just making sure that whenever all these emails come in, like I said, we have multiple people looking at it. So we want to make sure that each email is kind of taken look at and taken care of. I saw you had some of the statuses from over there. That might be something that's pretty useful.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So I'm going to answer that in two ways. Number one is the first way that we do that is visibility, right? So the first common theme on hiver that you're going to see is complete visibility which means that even though you're all working in your individual accounts, if an email comes into your main inbox and you pick, it gets assigned to you and you reply and you haven't really cc'd anyone or cc'd the group or cc'd anybody. It's just a one reply to back to that email. That person on the other end, your client replies. Again. You reply again and you go back and forth three days into that conversation into a lot of back and forth. You've unfortunately called in sick. So you're not in today and someone needs to step in for you and take over. The core thing that hiver brings to us is the fact that when that someone needs to step in and take over, they have every single piece of context right in front of them. So if I go in and find an email from October the ninth, I see everything that's happened on that email up until that point in time, along with the draft that was left on it which was not sent yet. So I don't need to be cc'd I don't need to be forwarded. I open every email. I can get everything from start up until the latest piece of context on that thread. And I can step in and take over if required. And that's where the team section really comes in. So if you click on the team section, you actually see a list of all the people in your team. So for example, if I click on my team member, Cole's, name, I see these are the four emails assigned to Cole. I can open any of them. I can see all the back and forth. And if I know that Cole's not going to be in for the rest of the week, I simply select all of these and I can reassign it to someone else.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Okay. The… other thing, how does this look from the customer's point of view or the other person's point of view? So right now, they know our main email, right? It's a dispatch. They send an email there. They get a reply from that email. We have different signatures to kind of show who is sending it, but that's their point of contact. In the past. We've floated the idea of like, hey, what if not everybody sent the email here because there's a lot that didn't really work. They're going to continually send stuff over to our main email. So when we reply from that, does it show as a reply from dispatch or does it show as a reply from the individual's email?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  100 percent left to you? Okay?

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  We.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  support both options. So literally, if I go hit support reply here, I can have my name with the support email address, I can have my name with my email address, or I can have just the support name and support email address with my signature. The reason is the reason why it's so flexible is that from a hiver perspective, no changes in functionality. From a Gmail perspective, you're still in your account. So you can still configure individual signatures so on and so forth. So it's actually really easy. And if you do decide to go with the dispatch email address, Sebastian, you might have, you would have seen this already, but I'm just going to point out that this little Gmail setting works really well with hiver, which is a reply from the same address the message was sent to. So if an email was sent to dispatch, it'll reply with dispatch. If an email is sent to you, it'll reply from you and it'll pick automatically.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that's perfect. Yeah, cause we cause I know they do have that. So I just want to make sure that was still the option here.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Right. So I know we're coming up on time. So I just want to quickly summarize, right? So first things first, we cut down the wall traffic in the actual inbox by helping people log into their own individual inboxes and access dispatch from that. Once they access dispatch, with the automations with the slas, with all of these sort of like safety nets that we have, we want to make sure that every email comes in organized processed and ready to be assigned or automatically assigned to the right people or at least to the right group. So that the right, the people there have visibility on it. You have the ability to work together on these emails by at mentioning each other. There is a note section over here on the right where you can do that. And then finally, you can also track progress with open pending and closed based on the progress that has been made. Again, this is completely centralized. So from start to finish, we spoke about it all one piece in the middle, we did speak about Sebastian, which is the actual replies to the email. So with the actual replies, we've got two options. Both meant to save your team a whole bunch of time. Number one, if you think that this is a, very, standard request, they've requested a quote. So you're going to put a quote together, very standard request, you can create standard team wide templates with hiver. This is what that team wide template would look like. So I'm going to say.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Customs delay. So I'm going to say Sebastian, your customs delay and then it'll say, hello, Sebastian, the package has been cleared as custom. We'll be good to go in two hours, right? Clearly. I had to add the comma here. It's not the best written email. So if I want to just put it through a rough draft in here, I can just hit our AI compose which is essentially a chat gpt widget inside Gmail and it picks grammar, make it professional, make it empathetic, improve writing. So it'll essentially take your rough draft with all the contextual feedback and put it in there and you can click accept and that gets added in. This is one. So this is very standard stuff that doesn't really require a lot of computation as you are using hiver. Sebastian, this is the core aspect of our AI as you are using, our co pilot can kick in. Our co pilot learns from three sources. One, it learns from if you have a knowledge base on hiver optional, but if you do, which is part of our offering where you set up faqs and sections and everything we can actually learn from that, we definitely learn from actual conversations. As you can tell, you can add specific conversations to the co pilot to learn from. And third, and most importantly, what makes us stand apart is that you can choose what to train it with. If you have PDFS, word, docs, whatever it is that you want to sort of upload as a knowledge source, hiver can learn from that as well. Now, once it starts learning and understands what your team responds, it can come in and part of the AI which I said where it processes organizes assigns, it can also draft a very contextual reply for it. So in this case,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'm just going to find another email. Just give me a second.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So here, this is the email. I'm going to click on co pilot and I'm going to hit draft a reply. By this time, our AI has processed this email and has thought about three options to give you in terms of what would be the most appropriate reply. So in this case, the three options are confirm collection, acknowledge, approval, notify security team and request confirmation. As you can tell they are not generic responses. It says notify security team because it is part of the sop that we have fed it. So in this case, I'm going to say number three and I'm going to hit three. So once I give it that prompt, it will write a contextual reply for that email. Temporary access of Mike O'Donnell has been approved for 20 fifth to 20 seventh and will be collected from reception, please confirm when access card has been issued. Its email is in here, you can insert it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So it's almost a well made email. All you need to do at the end is just hit reply. Yeah. Okay.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  All right. So that has, yeah, I think we covered most of the big points there and certainly seems like something that would be able to help us. The other thing I wanted to cover just before going back over to my team, just so we have an idea is looking at an approximate price range, right? We want to know exactly what we're looking at. Obviously these numbers can be a little bit rough, but I want to know the ballpark just so that we know what we're looking into to start.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. So, I'm happy to send this over as well. And I'm like I said, if it's a largest team, we want to make sure that pricing if ever, we tick all our boxes and it comes down to pricing, we hate for pricing to be a stumbling block. So, when the time comes, Sebastian, all I will say is that we're open to having a conversation about what works best and finding a setup that works so. But essentially, we've got three pricing tiers. We've got growth pro and elite based on our conversation today, I think that you're looking at the pro primarily because the growth is capped at 10 users, right? So the pro pretty much gives you all the functionality that you need, all the load, balancing, the dashboards. We didn't even talk about reporting, but it gives you all of that. The elite is essentially for like really high level with like 50 60 people in that really high level. So, I would say you're looking at the pro and if the AI is requested, that is an additional 20 dollar add on if required, but that's completely optional. But, yeah, that's sort of where we typically stand from what I'm seeing so far.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Okay. Yeah, because I'm thinking about it, we have, I think roughly 70 people that would need access to it over the course of the month. Like I said, seven zero. Yeah. Okay. Over the course of the month, right? At a time, probably a max of 1,520. But just because logistics is 24 seven, we need three shifts during the day. We also need the weekends covered. So it gets to around the 70 person mark. So if I'm doing that right? On the higher end here, right? That's probably looking at almost 5,000 no or more. Yeah, on the highest end, less than 5,000 a month. But then that would be for, the pro and the AI at 65 plus the user. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, like I said, but yeah, I.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah, I want to, I want bulbark just so that, we know, right? Like let's say that's on, the higher end or I could get a decent range in there. So that way we could, have it figured out that way, just so we have.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  To be happy since you said, so, the one of the things we've done is, and the reason I'm even saying this is, I understand how flexibility around the number is.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, I want to make sure that you have the flexibility while not breaking the bank and look, we know that we don't want, we want to be, we need to be able to scale with businesses. And if we're getting like, if we're getting priced out and we're not being flexible, we tend, that tends to happen very quickly. So, if this is a good fit, and if we're able to tick all your boxes, we are 100 percent open to having a like sort of conversation and finding, a custom number there with both oai, and a custom number that actually helps us partner and build this, and scale.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yep, for sure. Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  In terms of next steps, Sebastian, I know you said, if this looks good, we will set up another call. Do you think we've seen enough to do that?

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah, I think so. I would have, to get back to my team. Like I said, I'm going to be taking a look at a couple options, but from what I could tell, we probably make sense, to have another meeting next week, if possible, sure to confirm with my team as well. But, yeah, like this is something that, we want to do in general. And it seems like you guys are kind of checking off a lot of the boxes. So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And that's why the reason why I'm sure you looked at G2 already where one of the highest rated, tools on there and have been so, for many years. I've been in the business since 2018. So it was sort of since then and, yeah, I'm happy to send over some collateral at the end of the call. I also include my calendar link. I assume that might be an easier way to schedule some time. And, if you have, if you have an off view options for next week, I'm happy to send over a tentative invite which we can modify. But if you want to sort of coordinate schedules, I'm happy to send over as well.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Yeah, yeah. That's that's perfect. I'll, I'm just going to reach out to my team to see who really wants to slash needs to be in the meeting and then should be able to find some time, to make it work.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sounds like a plan. Yeah, sounds like a plan. I will send over some, an email with all these information later and I'll check in with you beginning of next week to see where things are.

Sebastian Bratu (seb@fulgertransport.com):
  Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Thanks so much. Have a good one.
