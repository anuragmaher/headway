Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Chloe. How are you?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Good afternoon. I'm good. Thank you. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Good afternoon. I'm doing well. Thank you so much good. Shall we get started with the discussion or expecting more people to join in as well?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  No, it'll just be you and I, so yes, let's get started.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Perfect. Then. Well, thank you for scheduling this call with us. So my name is Yukta and I'll be helping you with the evaluation before we dive into it. I would love to understand what made, you know, look out for a tool like hiver in the market. Was it, what is it that, you know, you're currently working on? If you could just share some context, I think then I'd be in a position to understand it and accordingly show you the tool as well.

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Of course. So, I'm just inquiring on behalf of quite a small team. We work for a household. However we're currently struggling with because we use Gmail, we are struggling with the sort of distribution of emails between us. We find that their shared inbox is not really, it isn't benefiting us as a team. So we're looking for more sort of system that will allow us to appropriately delegate emails between us whilst we have a shared inbox, and also sort of shorten down those jobs using the AI functions and things like that. So that's why we're really coming to you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Which team is this for? If you could elaborate on how are you managing these emails today?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  So, it's just like I said, for a small team for a household. So this is more personal things to do with the house and whatnot. And yeah, at the moment, it's just being delegated in a fact that we assign ourselves on those emails within Gmail. But it's duplicating those emails over to us, you know, our personal or direct work emails and it's just duplicating the work over and over. So we're looking for a more sort of central command to be able to go to see all of the emails at the same time myself and say the other pa would be able to mark ourselves on those emails and show that we are working on them in real time as opposed to always this person on there. Are we going to have to wait for any network delays? Things like that, for them to show it's just so we can keep it a bit more neat and tidy, if that makes sense?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it does. So all these emails, are you're handling it through your own individual email addresses or do you have any genetic email?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Yeah. So we have one info email that we use, but like I said, it's then going off, to our personals as well, which is just making it a bit more difficult.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many people do we have who are handling this inbox?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Three, three to four people. It's a really small team at the moment. We may be expanding in the future, but just for now, it's only just a few of us.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So emails are being managed through info at the rate, but these are also going for individual inboxes which create friction. And obviously, there could be duplicacy as well through that. And as to, you know, who is handling what? Yeah. Got it. No problem. Chloe. I think I can help you with this in terms of valuation. Is this something which is like a very pressing concern for you that you would want to immediately solve or is this coming more from a place of having something in terms of better organizing and probably a good to have tool but not something that you would immediately would want to implement?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  I believe the boss is wanting us to implement this as soon as possible really in the sense that we just want to be working to the best, of our capacity like the best that we can do. But still, it's not something that we immediately need. You know, we have time. We have time. It's all a sort of work in progress. It's very early days for the household at the moment. So it's not too pressing but certainly something that we'd like to take on board in the future near future.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood understood. No worries. I think I can show you what we have. And then from there, we can take the conversation forward a few, a quick introduction. Hiver works on Google, so it integrates within your Gmail itself. So as you can see, I'm currently logged into my Gmail account, and I have downloaded here. So that's how I am part of these different shared mailboxes within my company. So in order to be able to better manage this inbox, we'll be creating one which will be connected to your info at the rate so that all three or four of you do not have to log into that info at the rate together or put a forwarding address to that. Rather you work on your account as you do today. And from there, you'll have info here which all of you will be part of. So all of you can access this inbox within your respective inboxes itself, right?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Amazing. Yes, that's already a positive. Just having it on the downbar a bit like outlook when you have a shared outlook inbox, for example, we found using that was, very, advantageous, or I have in previous roles. So when I came over to Gmail professionally and realised they didn't have it, I was shocked. So this is sort of exactly what I'm looking for.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's great. And we do work with a lot of people who are using outlook and the shared mailbox. That we have a separate tool as well. I mean beyond having just a shared mailbox which outlook inherently provides within hiver, you're able to do a lot more as well in terms of being able to then see what are the emails that are unattended and assign those emails between yourselves? So that we know at all times who's working on what. So that there's no duplicacy, there's no confusion. Am I handling this? Are you taking care of it even if you have emails coming onto your personal inbox and not directly going into the info, you can still manage these emails. So for example, if I pick this one as an example, and I feel that this email should be part of the inbox rather so that you have that visibility, you can always move those inbox to your respective shared mailbox. So that then wonderful after that, you can do everything that you would anyway do in the mailbox, so that we are all together and we know at all times who is handling what. So this is something that could be useful for sure enough for a team like yours which is fairly small, getting started. I think the foundation building that foundation by having something like this could really be useful. Yeah, I mean from here, you will be then assigning those emails to yourself. You can see everything that's assigned to you specifically in your mind section so that, you know, these are the ones that you need to work on. And for having full transparency across all team members who are managing this inbox or part of this inbox, you can see across everyone as to who is handling what. So currently, as I have no open emails which are distributed between my team members. I only have these six emails. So it becomes rather easier when I know that, OK, I'm not going to be in office for the next two days. So instead of having these emails sitting here and waiting for me to come back, I can go ahead and just reassign it to probably my colleague who can take care of it while I am not going to be available. So this becomes a lot easier for us to then be able to collaborate on these emails and make sure that nothing slips through the crack. So this is something that we can absolutely achieve. And with this, you would be in a position to sort of be able to collaborate on emails as well. So a lot of times it happens that I am the owner of this email, but I need to collaborate with you to get some review or some update. So that I can respond here. So you can just add a note section and mention any of your click and type your email message so that, you know, multiple people can work at the same time. No.

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  This is really good. This is sort of the kind of correspondence that we'd have between us as the pas and our main boss, it would be a good area for us to have that. And I'm guessing people will receive notifications when they are added as per, as you'd expect so that they could then, ah, maybe up in there or somewhere.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Notification. So every time anything gets assigned to you, when you're being mentioned, you will be notified about all of these.

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Wonderful. That's really good.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, when you mentioned your boss, like, could you tell me more about it? Like, is he or she going to be part of this inbox as well?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  So, they would, yes, they would have access, both of the boss, they would have access to the email, but it's not as if they would potentially be, they'd only handle what they needed to within the inbox, whereas myself and the other personal assistant would be the main sort of point of contact and the people handling really everything just sort of a last resort or, yeah, it's sort of, that, that utility that you just showed me being able to at them and ask them for maybe opinions or things like that to do with those emails that'd be really good because then we can bring it to their attention appropriately and professionally.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think for them, I'm assuming these are the founders as well, the boss that you're working with, right? I understood. Yeah. So I think for them, it'll be easier to track this inbox as well at all times, right? They can see, in terms of how these emails are distributed as well. And like one view, understand how, you know, everybody's working on these emails, so they will have the visibility at all times and for you also to be able to collaborate, it'll become a lot easier so that you have a cleaner structure in terms of how you're handling these emails. So, when you're done working, you can, when you're replying may use your email templates as well. This is something that you can create as a repository.

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That whenever you're working on an email, you put a placeholder as you have in the template and it's good to go if you want, you can modify it or you can just send the response as it is and mark this email closed since this is done, right? So you can then have a full tracking and understanding of how we are progressing in terms of handling these on a regular basis. And maybe for your founders, they can go into analytics to understand certain metrics as well in terms of, you know, is this info at the rate the main inbox where you're engaging with your prospective clients or like?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Yes, it, is, this is the main hub for everything at the moment.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So why I'm asking this question is maybe for you or the leadership, it would be a good idea to understand the workload, you know, how many are receiving, how are we responding to them for each user? Also? You can see that data individually. And if you want ads for this specific inbox, when I'll categorize your emails into different buckets, like how we do labels like in Gmail. Yeah. So you can create those tags and accordingly, you can see for each tag, how the, you know, emails coming in and how we are resolving those. So you can create these tags here and apply those tags on, you know, specific email and from there. So it becomes easier for you to then if you want to just look at emails belonging to one category, you just go there and put all those emails right there itself.

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Yes, that's, really good. That's certainly something we're looking for. So, thank you for showing me that. Sorry, I'm making notes at the same time. So, if you hear my pen going, just ignore me.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I can hear the click, well, that's fine. I think, this would be the basic workflow Chloe that I wanted to show you based on what you discussed with me. Of course, there are a lot more things you can do because hiver just not cater to, you know, the team of your size. We do have a lot of within that bracket as well. But we also cater to some of the larger enterprises customers as well, right? So it covers a lot of things in terms of automations, how you can automatically apply tags, slas, and all, I did not want to go into more details, since I feel that this is something that you could use as a starter and probably build from. But if there is something specific that I might have missed.

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  You're good. No, that's really, sort of at least for the moment, like you say, yes, there are things to do because, the, the bosses do travel around and things like that. So, there are different properties worldwide that we'd need to track and obviously important documents, things to do with taxes and whatnot. So, this would be, this would be, really, sort of as it is advantageous. And then, yeah, expanding on what we might need in the future. At least, we can, you know, take it from here, but this is a really good start. So, thank you for showing me these, appreciate it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. It's it's my pleasure. So from here, Chloe, what do you suggest we do? Because we do offer a free trial as well that you can start? I can help you with that, setting up your inbox, and then you can start testing it with your colleague. How it's working for you. It's not going to cover your current process at all. So it's be, you know, it's going to just create the shared mailbox and you can start using it or do you want to discuss this internally first, and then probably we should be circling back connect again?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Yes, what I'll do is I'll go back to the boss. I'll speak to him and I'll see what he thinks of the notes and everything I've taken. And then we'll see from there, I've also utilized the free demo. So, I'm going to trial that with him, at some point this upcoming week, so that then we can have a play around ourselves, see how it'll work with the inbox as well, but this has been really enlightening. So, I really appreciate this. Is it all right? If I get back to you on everything?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, that is absolutely fine. I understand that you might want to discuss this internally in terms of the budget. Like, do you want me to show you the pricing and how much it'll cost you if you actually decide to implement this?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Yes, please, if that's okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because this could help, you know, presenting it as well internally. So, I think based on the discussion that we have had, of course, there are different periods of plans that you can see and each one comes with its own set functionalities based on what all you need. I think the growth plan will suffice for you as you start using it because the free plan will not really have anything in terms of the tags templates, analytics anything there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, I think growth will give you all of those basic things. And, yeah, in case you decide, you can probably look at this plan to begin with.

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Amazing. No, thank you so much for that. I will go back to the boss. I'll run it all past him. I'll see what he says, and yes, no, thank you for just really enlightening me, on how it works. I really appreciate it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. Just a small request. Would you want to connect back for like 10 minutes feedback sometime next week wherein you could let me know how you would like to move forward?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Yes, I'd love to, that would be really good. Would you have availability on Thursday by any chance?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, Thursday we can do, would you be available at the same time as today?

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Yes, that would be really good. We'll we'll do it for one o'clock okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Then let me share the invite with you and I'll also share the credentials over the email so that you could refer those as well. And we'll look forward to connecting next week then.

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Thank you so so much for this demo. I really appreciate it. You've really enlightened me on all of the bits to do with hiver. So, yes, I'm certain it's going to be a positive one. But thank you so much, lovely.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I look forward to that, Chloe. Thank you so much. Take care, bye.

Chloe Child (chloe.child@liao.info):
  Take care bye.
