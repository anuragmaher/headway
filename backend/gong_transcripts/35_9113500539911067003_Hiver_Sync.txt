Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's up, Leah?

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  How's it going?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good. How are you?

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Hanging in there?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice. I see that you also invited Devin for the call today?

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Yeah, he should be jumping in. He's our head of product. So just have some extra thoughts in here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And I know we wanted to touch base on like potentially, you know, kicking off like a trial or talk about like whatever potential next steps might be, what kind of makes the most sense for today's? Discussion…

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Good question. Sorry, last week was absolutely mental. So I did not have a ton of time to think deeply about this. I guess maybe we could talk through what a trial might look like. And… yeah, probably go from there. Okay. That makes sense. That's kind of what I was seeing if Devin could join to like have his thoughts of where his… product design brain goes that mine does not.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, essentially, how the trial works is we can kick you off for like a two week trial, give you total access to the platform to test out your workflows. You know, I know you were looking, you're looking at error calls as well from a phone integration. You can test the phone integration as well and stuff like that.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Because remember, you guys don't we would have to still integrate some kind of phone… call, text thing into hiver, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's correct. So, for people who do phone and SMS, they typically partner with error call because they'll handle that side of it. Yeah, but we do integrate with error call to make and receive calls.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And hey, Devin, how are you?

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Good, Cole. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Doing well, doing well. I appreciate you hopping on. So, Leah and I were just discussing, you know, we had a demonstration of hiver last week and there was some potential interest to kick off like a, you know, proof of concept trial just to see how, you know, the team could function using a tool like hiver. So, you know, for today's discussion, I figured we can just kind of jump into that a little further.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Sounds good or if you need a overview, Devin, like we can also take a couple minutes to show you, what they've got that's.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  yeah, that works as well too. So I can hop into the platform if you'd like to see, you know, some of the functionality. Does that make sense for you, Devin? Like would you want me to hop into the product or?

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  Yeah… sounds good. Let's go for it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. So just taking a look at my screen here. So what's nice about hiver and a key differentiator off the bat for us is that we are a certified Google partner, right? So we live within that Google workspace. So going to the admin panel, this is where we're going to set up, you know, the channels that we can engage with our clients, whether it's you know, email chat, whatsapp, voice integrations, with providers like Aircall, we do offer a knowledge base and a customer portal as well to manage those communications. And then this is where we'll set up the rest of the platform from an integrations automation and SLA perspective. So we are a full fledged platform. But then going on the left hand side here, right, is those different channels that… we're collaborating in. So whether it's email like this is a support share mailbox, this is our phone call mailbox, but clicking into the support one, here, right? It's going to open up some sub views beneath it that's going to help us manage the intake of communications. So the first is the unassigned section, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be distributed. The next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me. And then there's the team view. So really just understanding, you know, what is everyone on the team currently working on in real time? What's outstanding, and what needs to be completed? Just want to pause right here. Any questions so far?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  The reason we were looking at this one Devin is because it went through the G suites that we already use. So potential thought of it might not be as complicated to integrate into what we already use makes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Sense. Yeah. We can get up and running in a week. It's a very, you know, light lift tool from an implementation perspective, and we provide onboarding services and customer success managers as well. But going into, you know, the unassigned section. So when you're working through an email, a tab is going to open up on the right hand side where we can take some actions, right? So assigning a conversation to someone that's the first way we can do it manually, the next way is through a round Robin automation. And then the next way is like skill based routing. So identifying key phrases, key words in the email and then routing it to that specific person who, you know, has the skill to answer that question. Then we can track the status. So, you know, whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks… organizing the conversations with tags. So these tags place conversations in buckets, folders, or views to organize queues, organize conversations to ensure that people are working through the right queries, and also provide analytics on the backend. A quick pause here. Devin, any questions on the assignment statuses or tags?

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  No, I guess more question for Leah. We already do this in front today, right? Like this is essentially, yeah. So.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  This is kind of something we're really making sure anything we potentially move to has the same capability because it's really useful.

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  I see. Okay. Yeah. So we're.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  a direct competitor with front… that's you know, the main person we compete against in this, you know, contact center space. And then we provide those custom fields, right? So showing email priority, maybe the customer level if they're VIP, high value, whatever that might be. These are all configurable though based on the data that you're looking to connect and, you know, it's all viewable. It's all actionable. It's reportable, and it's all searchable on the backend as well. And then just like the classic collaborative aspects, so being able to collaborate internally on conversations. So I'll send this note to Devin. He'll receive that notification up top right here. He'll click on it. It'll take him to this thread where we keep having that back and forth conversation. Maybe he'll use our AI summarizer to get like up to speed on the conversation, really quickly, see the AI sentiment analysis, how the client's feeling. We can also use this AI sentiment analysis to escalate conversations. But let's say we need more information. You know, we can use our AI co pilot to draft responses. So we can feed our co pilot like website links, word, docs, PDF, stuff like that to then send out responses. So using the information and documentation that you have internally to streamline responses.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then once, you know, I deem this is perfect, you know, I can insert it into the draft where I can either continue editing this or, you know, ship it off to the client.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So just some great ways to use our AI to, you know, effectively provide more context by leveraging your data. Want to pause here, Devin, what are your thoughts on this so far?

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  I mean to be honest, Leah is probably more well equipped and knowing front end generally what our team uses. So as long as there's parity that's all I'm golden on my side.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. Is there anything else that I can double click on here, Leah… that needs more clarification? Okay?

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  For me, not necessarily, I guess like I think I brought you on here, Devin, just to be like if there's anything you had kind of looked around and seen of other providers that you might have questions on or thinking about how this would link into our systems?

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  I think that was going to, I mean like full capability like right here tagging or whatnot, I think those are all like common level of features for us, this type of work. So should be all good. Yeah, my question. The reason, the main question I'm going to ask is how this is this equipped to connect to other databases and context layer that we might have? Do you have a data layer or memory layer that you do a little bit of connection with? So I don't know for example, if I want to connect this with a notion knowledge base. Is that a possibility?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that's actually what we're building out right now for some of our clients, we're building an out of the box integration with notion to pull in that information for AI and streamlining responses and stuff like that. So we do have open apis, we connect with tools like Hubspot, Salesforce, slack, like we're a platform at the end of the day?

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  You have a list of all those connectors… that you can provide?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 100 percent, I can share that with you right after this. And then if there's anything custom that you would be looking to build, like we also do build custom integrations… for our clients. So that's something we can also further scope out if there's not, if it's not on the app list.

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  Got it. Sounds good. Do you have something demo able in terms of what you have created? I know you said you're building it right now, where is it? In terms of like finishing it out? What does your roadmap look like?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I would have to go back to my team to understand the timeline of the notion integration, but I can get back to you with that timeline.

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  Yeah, and I'll be honest, like notion is just one example. Like I'm sure. Like many other teams, everybody has a lot of different contexts just spread across everywhere. Yeah. In terms of like how we communicate to our customers, if we could consolidate some of those things, it might be, it might be a good one. The main use case that we've been talking about a lot more and more is we use active admin as a way to do order tracking and that's kind of where our backend is kind of just living today. But one of the main use case that we come forward is what is your order status, right? So if there was a way that we could automatically see our active admin and then be able to respond that rather than like a human loop being part of, that would be like our first step and the first use case to tackle.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you would want to be able to see order status and have an automated reply without anyone getting intervened?

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  Spot on.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, yeah, that's something I can scope out with my team as well. Cool. But as you can see like this is like our Salesforce integration, so we can pull in data into Salesforce, you know, information that you want to view, as a team. And then we can also trigger actions out into platforms, right? So whether it's creating a Jira issue, creating an item board in Monday, a lead in Salesforce, like we do have the ability to trigger actions out into platforms as well. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And is there anything else from a technical perspective, Devin, you know, on top of like those integrations and those apps that you want me to send over that I can provide for you in the meantime?

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  I was also curious,, you did just talk about how if it's not on the app list and you do a little bit more white glove service too? How does that, how does that essentially work? Or how does your business model work to kind of help out with that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So depending on like what integrations or functions you'd want customized for you, we would get on a scoping call with my engineering team, understand the exact workflow and use case that you're looking to achieve our team would scope it out, understand the statement of work that would be associated with it, and then we would build it for you within the partnership.

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  Okay. Is that an additional charge based off of like a possible subscription model?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  If you buy our elite package, it is included, which is a 75 dollars per user per month.

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  Okay. Sounds good. Good to know.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But in terms of, you know, next steps, Leah, and getting like a proof of concept or trial on the board, would that be something you'd be looking to do in the near term or what kind of makes the most sense for you?

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  I mean, if we do want, it probably would be in the next few weeks. So, kind of like looking through what we've got as options and deciding like, how many of these we are going to trial because we can only do one at a time.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right, right.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Don't have these all competing and put the team through a whole bunch of.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Suits, yeah, you're not trying to have, you know, people test 10 things and they're like, they don't know which way is up right now. Yeah.

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  Sorry, one last question. Do you only do emails?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We do email chat, whatsapp customer portal, knowledge base in terms of phone and SMS, that would be with Aircall?

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  You partner up with Aircall?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's correct?

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  Got it. Okay. For chatbot, you did, did you just develop your own UI that you could kind of integrate or inject into wherever for a chatbot then?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So, just copy and paste the snippet code, put it wherever you want on the website, for us to host a chat, but.

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  Any communication channel is in that G suite, UI.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So they're all within the UI on that left hand panel, that I was showing before?

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  Okay, cool.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But when would be, and just kind of curious from your perspective, like, is this something you feel like you would want to try with the team because of the nativeness of the Gmail solution, or what are your, what's your overall thoughts?

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  I know Devin and I are meeting later to go over some different options too. So, we'll probably come up with, a choice of what we're going to end up, if we will try or not. I think I'll see what our final, like, all… everything that's going to be as a trial. So, don't have an exact answer.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  I guess if we do a trial, what do you need from us, to sort of move forward with that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Pretty much we'll just do like, a trial kickoff call. So, we'll just need to be white labeled so we can download the Chrome extension for users and that there's no, you know, blockage from an it perspective.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, you know, we're pretty much good to go. And then, we provide, a POC, kickoff call, getting the team set up, helping you get up and running with the solution. Okay? Would same time maybe next week, Leah, just work to sync with you to see, what, you know, just kind of talk about potential next steps for kicking off a trial or we can serve that as a trial kickoff call tentatively.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  We can, one other question though about doing a trial, is how is that going to work? If we're not working with Aircall currently? Like, what are we going to sort of get out of a trial or how do we do that? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you can also trial Aircall in unison. So they do also offer free trials. So, if you want to knock out two birds with one stone, I've done that with a bunch of clients as well.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Okay. That is good to know.

Devin Min (devin@inspectify.com):
  In terms of migration, it retains every other calls and stuff like that, what we had before.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, that would be a conversation for Aircall in terms of the phone calls and stuff like that.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Just because that's the service, you know, they're providing they do the phone migration and stuff like that for sure.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Yeah, usually, they're able to at least port numbers.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, 100 percent. Yeah.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Whether we'd be able to have a whole text history that might be a little more complicated but numbers probably, yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. So I will just throw that, and that works for you, Leah, next week, same time and Devin, just to do like a trial sync call, I just sent that over for next week, so we have it, we can always move it around if need be.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Yeah, we can put it on there and decide which way we're going to, which way we're going to go.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. And I can follow up with some more additional information, Devin that you asked, and then if there's any other questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out. But I appreciate, you know, you both hopping on the call here today.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  All right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Thanks, guys. All right. Take care. Bye.

Leah Schmidt (leah@inspectify.com):
  Bye.
