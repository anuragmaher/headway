Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, Kelly. Thank you for joining.

Kelli:
  Good afternoon. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good. How are you doing?

Kelli:
  Good. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Do we have Michael joining in as well today? He's here. Oh, okay. Nice to meet you both. Great. All right. Let's begin with the setup. I'll help you with the step by step guide to set up your test account on hiver. Now to do, so, do you mind sharing your screen and logging into your Gmail? And I'll take it up from there itself.

Kelli:
  To the sales Gmail or my Kelly Gmail?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hiver has to be set up on personal inboxes, and we will set up sales inbox right inside it. So, if you could just share your screen, I'll explain that?

Kelli:
  How do I do that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  In zoom, there is a green button at the bottom that says share screen.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Lovely. So, this looks like your personal inbox isn't it? Yeah. Okay. Could you open another window and type in another tab and type in? WWW, hiverhq. Com.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Start free trial.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Your email address, Kelly?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Continue Google?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Continue email chat. Continue. Now, we need to add extension. It's a hiver plugin, add to Chrome.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, we have hiver… set up hiver. Yeah. Can you click here for me? Yeah. Now, we're going to do set up the shared inbox. Yeah, a bit about your company. These are just the regular details.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think you might want to remove zero from prefix since we have chosen Australia as a country already, huh.

Kelli:
  Should I put voice on there?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I mean, yeah, I mean, that's okay. We can always set up the voice later as well. So, yeah, that's fine. All right. Yes, authenticate your account.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Continue.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  yep. Select all. Continue.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right now, your hiver account is set up. Now, we need to set up the sales inbox into it so you could give it a name sales?

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And from the dropdown yeah, you should have sales, which is fine. I mean, even this inbox can get any sort of inquiry. So, let's just leave it like that next? Yeah. Now, here is the next step that, yeah, connect email, please. Now, do you have the sales email address as a user account that has a password to it? Or is that a Google or an alias? Yeah, we do.

Kelli:
  No, it's a password to it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, we're going to be checking the first option here, the first option?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, use another account. And now that's where you need to log in into sales as a one time activity.

Kelli:
  Let's see if this works. Hang on. Let me find the password.

Kelli:
  Do you have a password? Michael?

Kelli:
  I think I've got it.

Kelli:
  Yep.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Continue.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yep. Select all and… continue. Almost done. All right. We can do this later. We can always invite the users and do the setup later. Let's just, first of all, make sure the account is set up perfectly. Okay. Yeah, click on, do this later. Skip. Anyway. Yeah. Okay. Now, what we also would like to do is this is a demo inbox that we set up by default. Now that we're going to be testing everything on sales, I would recommend we just delete this demo inbox so that we don't have confusions. So there is a delete button at the end… of it. Yeah. Just type in, delete demo inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now that your hiver… is set up already. Now, do you want to just close this admin panel, take me to the main Gmail screen. So you have your personal emails coming on the top inbox and you would receive sales emails right inside the sales inbox. Now, when you add more folks to the setup, that's where you would. So you already have started receiving the emails by the way. Yeah. Okay. Now, from here itself, let's go ahead and add Michael to the account. First of all, can you take me to the admin setup settings?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then admin panel… under the sales inbox. Yeah, I mean, everything would happen in the shared inboxes. So if you could take me to the shared inbox… you have sales inbox. So click here… now users, you can get, yeah, this is where you could add user add, Michael?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So all Michael needs to do is simply log in into his Gmail install hiver extension and that's pretty much it. He doesn't have to go through the entire setup that we have just done. Kelly, that was just for the admin setup. Actually. Yeah. Okay. Now, under users and roles, if you could take me to the users and roles control, let's also make Michael an administrator. Okay? Do you see this role says member? I would want him to be the admin as well so that you both can the first option, you both can actually make changes to the account, the different workflows set up and everything. And obviously, you both can have access to the reports and dashboards.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. First thing first, let's go ahead and let's go into the shared inboxes… sales and box. Now, do you want to turn on the auto assignment where you're routing emails to all agents available?

Kelli:
  I'm not sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you want to first of all, make sure that any email which is in specific to subject content coming in from a different supplier, you want to route these emails to the agents in your team? Okay? Or do you first of all, want to make sure that you're manually sorting emails and assigning it? And once you are done with it, like once you organize the emails better?

Kelli:
  Yeah, we'll just do the auto assignment. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So you'll be doing the auto assignment. Okay? Click here, please… and turn this on.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And you could always allow users to control their availability, which meaning in case users do not want emails to be assigned to them or they want to just keep themselves away. You could always give them the availability. I mean, control, but I would say if you do not want it, you can just leave it like that.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. Now, let's also go ahead and turn on certain AI functionalities for you guys.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, turn on the thank you detector for any email, which is just simply thank you. You would not need to work on it. Hiver automatically closes that email. Okay? I will go ahead and set this up at the backend for you… AI tagging. Can you configure this one? Now? Basically, what it would do is as, and when you receive emails, hiver will look at those emails, absolutely, understand that context and start tagging it on your behalf, you don't have to manually do that, but it could help you triage those emails into multiple buckets for that. We can always let hiver know that what sort of tags do we really need? Because these category of emails we keep receiving every now and then, so you can simply click on add tags… and let's just simply create a new tag. Now, think of different email scenarios that you received today in your sales inbox… text with.

Kelli:
  Me.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I can think of quotations, bookings… discounts. Yeah. Okay. Now description could be, it could be like, hey, as long as any context of the conversation does talk about, so you could give a quick description here. What should be those back order advisors?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Anything in particular, these emails are talking about apart from this, it's.

Kelli:
  from a supplier, letting us know the date of when a back ordered item is going to come in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, I would say as, and when supplier gets back to us with an advice, so I would just kind of keep it a little more, you know?

Kelli:
  General?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. All right. Save the changes. You can give it any color by the way.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Create color, save changes. We can also create couple of more such, you know, tags.

Kelli:
  Should I be using this to sort in eBay orders that have dropped in? Just a notification that we normally archive? Or should that be just like a automation auto assignment?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We can look at the AI tagging by the way. I mean, even if these are drop ins or some parcels from, did you say eBay?

Kelli:
  Let's just say we get all right, just from our E commerce system, we get seven or 80 emails a day, which is just a CC for an order that's been made on our, there's no value to it. Oh, okay. So, would we auto assign those or would we just do a, no?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's going to be automations, where you don't have to work on those emails. They're just notifications, right? So we'll just auto, close those in hiver.

Kelli:
  All right. So, quote requests, another tag, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. We don't have it. So you can create one. Yeah, quote requests.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Kelli:
  It's easy to come.

Kelli:
  Yep.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. We can always, you know, think of different such requests and come back to the automations. I mean, these tagging, let's go ahead and quickly to the automation where you receive so many emails, but you don't have to work on those notification emails, just the order related ones, right? So create an automation and give this one a name first of all, which are these emails? I mean, are these coming in from your E commerce portal?

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, I would say, yeah, I mean, just delete everything automation. One also, I mean, you don't have to be there, keep it there. Great mark, post order notification. All right now, whenever the new conversation come into your inbox, add a step… I would say condition if select… condition… is coming in from, I'm sure this email address is very specific that sends these notifications?

Kelli:
  Huh. Not the email address. It would say, it would have a name saying BB wholesale supplies order receipt.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So that subject, that is very definite, yeah, but.

Kelli:
  That can only be, if that's if sometimes customers reply to it with a request.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Kelli:
  So, can you make it that it's the first email only and then customer might reply and say, can you change my address or can you add a pillowcase?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you want to take me to the sales inbox and show me a quick example? Yeah, because even if we happen to close the email, the first order notification email that does not require your intervention, and if a customer still chooses to reply onto that email, hiver is by default going to be opening that email for you. I just want to make sure that one email has been sent to you with the same subject and the same copy is also sent over to the customers because only then they get an option to reply to that email.

Kelli:
  Do you want to see an example of someone replying to the email?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yep. Where the original email was sent to you guys that did not require your attention. And then maybe somebody just replied on top of that.

Kelli:
  I'll just put this over here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Maybe you can open another window a tab and then show me because I'm still seeing the Gmail screen with hiver on it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You got that. Yep. Okay.

Kelli:
  So, there's the notification is the first one and then she's replied and said, can I have an update on where this order is please?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. Now, that's okay. So, there's email actually.

Kelli:
  We could go via smptoneatomail. Com. Au.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm actually thinking multiple ways. Can you, can you expand this to and from section? Yeah. So, okay, this is customer by the way. And this always comes from sales at the rate we are. Okay. So, this is some setup at the backend. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Could you scroll this down? I mean, can I quickly go through the chain of the thread? Okay. So, oh, could you, scroll up a bit? I wanted to go to the first post where customer asked for an update. Can you, can you enlarge this one? Huh. Okay. So they actually sent direct email to sales like they just reverted. Okay, fair enough.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Give me one minute. Let me quickly cross check with one of my support guys before we end up setting something which may create confusion later. So, give me one quick minute please.

Kelli:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Something that we can absolutely do. I just want to make sure that I'm not skipping, any part, and we don't end up doing any mistake. So, yeah, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi, Kelly and Mike, we have got Basit from our technical support. Hi, Basit. Yeah.

Basit:
  Hello?

Kelli:
  Hi.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  What we try and do here is any email that we receive today in our sales inbox from a very specific workflow, which is all of these emails are the supply order related notifications. But these are no action needed. Emails. By the way, we just simply want these emails to be auto closed by hiver. Now, we got that straightforward that this is a very specific subject. Can you scroll this email up? Kelly? Maybe Basit could get a good context of what we are referring to. So the emails would always come from this subject, BNB wholesale supplies. Now. Basit. The only catch is there are certain instances where customers happen to reply to the email which should not be auto closed?

Basit:
  Do customers reply to the email after this?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Notification is triggered? Yes?

Basit:
  Yeah. Then like hiver will auto close the emails. And once customer replies on it, it'll auto open.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. But given that we are still choosing the same subject next time when there's a reply on the email, should it not, I mean it should definitely not close the email again.

Basit:
  It'll work only on the first email on the thread. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. So, you're saying, for the first email, the notification email will be closed by hiver. If there is a reply from the customer, it would auto open because hiver triggered the automations only on the first instance.

Basit:
  Yes, that's right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Yeah. In that case, I mean, it works really fine. We can just choose the subject line as it is, go back to hiver settings.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I think it's a different window altogether.

Kelli:
  Oh, do you not still have the other one?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Did you open up a new browser or just a tab? I mean, it looks like a new browser altogether. Do you want to just minimize this one?

Kelli:
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Subject is, now, can you paste the exact subject right there?

Basit:
  No, Rakesh, it should be, contains any of the.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Subject. Yeah, yeah… contains any of, and then you paste the entire, yeah, and add a step… action… select action, and you just close the update the status to close.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And what additionally we can do is just add a quick tag to it, which are Marco… post order notifications that also can be a step here, add a step… and action, just add a tag, select action, add tags. And I don't think we have a tag called, you know, Marco post, but we can always come back here and add a tag if at all it's needed. Otherwise, these emails are still going to be auto closed for you guys.

Kelli:
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, let's go ahead and delete this step for now. Let's make sure that we save this one. There's a delete option here. I mean, right here on the top, yeah… save and enable. All right. But I think we are good for now. You can drop off. You may have more customers calls if in case there's anything else, I would let you know all.

Basit:
  Right, fine. Can you review the automation again?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, I can. Definitely, could you click here. Can you click on this automation workflow? Yeah, I mean, just click here anywhere on the automation workflow. It should give us. Okay. Yeah.

Basit:
  Looks good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Thank you. All right, Kelly. We can move on to the next. Do you have any such other workflows that require this sort of automations? Now, this is auto closing emails by the way, you can think of emails which are coming in today, but you want definite people to be owning those emails?

Kelli:
  That's a similar type of thing.

Kelli:
  Being sent a credit from a supplier. So that needs to be assigned to Michael?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Automatically. Yeah. And how many such requests do you get on everyday basis?

Kelli:
  Not a lot, maybe one or two three.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But it does not require anybody else's intervention. It should just straight off. Go to Michael, no matter what. Okay. Let's create an automation… give exactly the same name to it so that you remember it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. As, and when the new email come in, add a step.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The first variable is fine.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Add step. Now, do these emails come from a very specific email address for these credit requests?

Kelli:
  No.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. What is the common variable? Do you want to show me exactly the same example, so we can pick the relevant field?

Kelli:
  Probably just subject credit.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. But that's little, you know, too vague, I would say because even your customers can send email with the subject credit. I would rather prefer a very specific, you know, or even if this email does talk about something in body, which is more definite.

Kelli:
  All right. Don't worry about that one.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Are you sharing your second screen with sales inbox to it? Or maybe just quick example of such credit request?

Kelli:
  No, they are all different. It depends on how the supplier does it. So it's… probably not worth doing for the amount we get.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'll tell you what would be the best in that case now, as, and when you receive the email and you quickly get to see that this email is about credit request, what we can do in hiver is we can auto tag that email because somehow the context would be same, right? There could be different ways to write it, but the exact context of the email would be same. So we can auto tag those emails under credit request. So we'll create a tag. And on basis of tag, we can always make sure that this email gets forwarded to Michael. I mean, just gets assigned to him. So for that first of all, let's go ahead and create a tag because we don't have the tag already, so we can go back to Gmail inbox. Yeah, just leave it. It's fine. We can always come back here. Just cross this admin panel and take me to the main Gmail screen right inside the tags here. Yeah, click here. Yes, please. So we have these two, but we can create more tags. Yeah. So here, you could say credit note from supplier. Yeah. And here, you could always explain… what could be these scenarios where you want this note tag to be added on those emails automatically… as in when supplier sends an email that requests for a credit note from any of our suppliers, and you could also give supplier names for context.

Kelli:
  Does that help?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, hospitality. Yeah, these are the different suppliers, very cool.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Like that, yep, create, give it a color and create it… all right now. Okay. Now, before we move ahead, do you have such more tags in mind? Like some more category?

Kelli:
  Of emails? What was the tag you were talking about before? Yeah, go ahead.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, user description?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. All right. Very clear. You can choose a color so that you could differentiate.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Some of the general tags that most of the sales teams do follow is something to do with the discounts or pricing request, quotation request? Are these slightly different in your workflow?

Kelli:
  Yeah, generally, it's quite. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, we can go back again into the hiver setup settings here on the top admin panel… sales inbox. From the shared inbox, go into the sales one, please, because every setting that we're going to be doing is inside the sales inbox. Yes, please. Click here, automation workflows.

Kelli:
  I want that tag now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Action. This is not going to be a condition but an action.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Yeah. Save that. Now. We can always create a second automation… now instead of this as, and when the tag is added, now, this is going to be a second automation where you want these credit email notes to be assigned to Mike. So instead of new emails, do you see add, yeah, tags added? Add a step if, yeah… tag is condition, select the condition if the tag is any of. And now you define the tag, right? Add a step.

Kelli:
  Absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Action, assign it to Mike.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And on top of it, if you want a quick notification to the customer, like you want to write a quick email note, that's also possible by the way, because in this scenario, before Mike gets to work on it, you might want to send a quick thank you note or are you saying that they're okay to wait because we got it that we are supposed to do it?

Kelli:
  Yeah. All right. So, would I have the email set up or do I put the email? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You could just send a reply actually. Do you see the email option right below tag that says send a reply?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And that's where you could just set up a quick notification template. Hey, thank you for contacting. We got the request for a credit note and that's how you could, you know? Okay, okay.

Kelli:
  Great. Okay. Fantastic.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you could just delete this one for now. Let's just save this and enable it.

Kelli:
  So, I have the tag. It's going to reply to them and it's going to forward it to Michael.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, great. Absolutely. Now, it works both ways even if you see these emails which have been tagged by hiver, automatically, the automation would trigger otherwise, also, when you add a tag manually, let's say, you know, in the meanwhile, hiver is still trying to understand if this is the exact email or customer sent an email that does not resonate to credit note request automation, workflow, like AI did not detect it because customer somehow wrote it in a very different fashion. You still get an option to add a tag to the email manually. So the moment you add, it would get assigned to Mike.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right now, under the slas, now, do you deal with these emails which are time sensitive for you? Like you want to work on these emails in four hours in two hours. Do you have anything of such like you want to track these response times?

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I would say create a general policy, give it a name called default or general because these are going to be working on every email. However you can always differentiate the important emails and you can say these are urgent slas. Yeah. So when I speak to customers, a couple of my customers, I've got VIP customers versus the regular customers.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now that you are putting it all conversations, mind it that when you are also sending out an email, the SLA would also trigger, but you're not controlling because let's say if I need to reach out to Kelly, I don't know when Kelly is going to be replying back to me. I would rather say it is more appropriate to track it on inbound conversations.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, you have option here to say, how long do you want to wait in the beginning to reply to these emails for the first time? Like would that be four hours? Would that be eight hours? And we can always consider the business hours by the way, we can set up the business hour templates, whatever your working business hours are for regular days?

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, would that be okay to say eight business hours are good timing for you to reply to the first email? Four or two? Okay, fair enough. And… okay, two business hours.

Kelli:
  10 minutes, 10 minutes, Rakesh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Are you saying 10 minutes within 10 minutes? You want to reply back to the customers?

Kelli:
  I do, but I'm the boss, so.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, we have, by the way, we have got customers that do reply within 15 minutes?

Kelli:
  We reply straight away if we can, because that's when the person's at the email and thinking about it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Now, but the only point here is that this is an SLA trigger running. I mean, this can actually give you a lot of reporting that says almost every email is not done in 15 minutes. So realistically, it may be a little too stringent.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Two hours is fine. And now resolution is by default, like I showed you emails are open, but we want to close the resolution we want to get done with it. So this is going to be 24 business hours, which is essentially eight business hours is going to be in one day. And then you're looking at see almost two… three, three, three working days. Is that okay for you?

Kelli:
  All right. So, one of the.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  because we would look at the business hours, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you want to basically do it in at least one day. All right. You can create this policy for now and let's come back and add the business hour template to it. Can you take me to the settings page here?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Create a template.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Create business hour template, give it a name, general hours or whatever you call working hours… and you… simply need to drag and drop this… eight to five, okay?

Kelli:
  Eight to four.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right.

Kelli:
  Why is this one split in two?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Because sometimes we want to keep some breaks in between if these are like typical, you know, customer contact center like operations. So they would want to say, hey, give us 30 minutes break in between. So you don't really need it. I mean, ours is a different set of business. So, yeah… you can delete this, okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right now that we have set this up, scroll down a bit, I would want to show you something here. You can always come back and set holidays later, wherever you have the entire calendar with you saying, hey, these are the Australian holidays. You can always. Yeah.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now that we have set it up. Okay. This is again something that we might want to just delete. All right. Did you save this? Okay. Save it. Please. Now, what we want to do is we want to actually apply this. Can you take me to the shared… inboxes again? Sales inbox… settings, please, before we get into SLS, we will still want to apply that. So click on settings. The last option. Sorry, no worries.

Kelli:
  It's five o'clock on Friday, and my brain's freezing every now and then.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. We'll keep it real quick and yeah, get you set up the basic ones for now. Okay. This is done. Let's go back to SLA, just one more time and yeah, edit the option. There's. A pencil button edit here and just simply click on consider business hours. There you go. That's pretty much it. Now, on your recommendation, do we want to reconnect on Monday? I'm absolutely fine to do that. For now. We have set up the account we have invited. Mike, you want, you can invite more folks. Also, there are tags. All you do is now that the emails would start to land inside your sales inbox, quickly, go ahead and look at the emails right there. That do require attention, assign people. These emails if these are not automation workflows already, look at the different open pending, close emails right? From there, start to reply, right from it. That's pretty much it to begin with. And then we can reconnect on Monday, if that's okay?

Kelli:
  Okay, great. Could you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Repeat that. I think you're a little far from the mic.

Kelli:
  If we're looking at the mailbox and we want to sign it to me, can you just look at the email that you want to sign and just drag it to my name?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You don't have to log in into sales inbox just so that, you know, you would always log in into mine.

Kelli:
  Can you show me how to assign one to Michael and email?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Could you take me to the Gmail inbox for yourself? Yeah. All right. Is this the sales inbox? Yes.

Kelli:
  It's my inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you want to refresh your Gmail screen just once?

Kelli:
  I remember.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  There was a page… that got unresponsive in the middle, so I want to make sure that we restore our Gmail first.

Kelli:
  This isn't good. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Give it a minute. Okay. Fair enough. Now that you have sales inbox, can you click here on the sales now? Mike, when you look at the mine section, these emails will automatically be in the mine section for you because these will be automatically assigned to you.

Kelli:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. For an example?

Kelli:
  All my emails are still going to sit there. I'm just,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  these are the older emails by the way. I believe these are the ones which we set up which got assigned before the automations… did kick in. But what you can do is you can click here, select these three emails. I'm going to select these emails from here itself.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, you could close this team section by the way, these are the emails which are assigned to Kelly versus Michael. But in case there are emails on the unassigned that does not require your attention, for an example, these three, do you get an option to select these emails from here? Yes, select these three and simply got it. Yeah, bulk action, let's just close them. You don't have to open these emails. You get an option here that says close, this is flag button on the top.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then just apply close that's all and it will actually move out. Now, the new emails would start to follow the same automation workflows. And under all views, you would see the closed emails right there. So if you click on all views… you have the closed emails in the closed bucket.

Kelli:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, if you notice anything which we, which we are closing are going to be moving into the closed bucket for you guys. And if you open any of those emails, I'll show you the hyper functionalities. You open this one email. Let's say just a test account. Okay? Now, this is the activity panel from where you assign email to yourself or your colleague. You change the status. If in case that does not need to work on, just close it. And you also can make a note for the rest of the team to look at why you're closing it, just say no, no action needed. Email. This is just junk fyi that's all.

Kelli:
  So that goes to my hyper section on my email. Yeah, if Kelly?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Needed.

Kelli:
  To.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  reply or add a tag for Mike. So she would just add mention your name in particular, and you would get a notification here on the top in your Gmail screen. Yeah. And if she just assigns email to yourself, you would see that in the team section. So if you click here on the team section, Kelly, Mike… would see all his emails in the mic section here. I mean, of course, you will see in the mic, but he would see in the mind section for himself, the ones which are assigned to him directly.

Kelli:
  Yeah… it's because it was closed, I think.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, this is closed, which is why you don't see that here because anyway, we are only going to be looking at those emails which are open or pending because that needs our attention. The closed ones are going to be moving into the closed bucket. So you close the team section from here on the top and you would receive all the closed emails under all views. By the way. Unassigned would be new unattended emails. Then is the ones which are assigned to you, Kelly. And then from team, you would see how many total emails are assigned to multiple folks in your team. And we can add more users by the way. Now, under all views, I would recommend you also keep the closed or pending option on the straight in the first screen itself so that you don't have to open again and again under the all views. So you can click on all views by the way. And there is a star button right next to pending and close like you can mark them. Favorite. Yes. So that's where you would see the pending emails on the top screen and the ones which are closed are also closed in the top screen. So if you don't want to look at the closed emails that's fine. I would say due soon can be something that you can look at because that's somewhat important emails that are about to overdue. So, yeah, I mean, you can only have five such. So, yeah.

Kelli:
  Okay. All right. My brain can't function anymore.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. I'll go ahead and send you guys an invite for Monday. Let's again reconnect. I'll help you further complete the setup. And then from there itself, you take it for a good drive, test it up. We'll add a couple of more folks from your team. If needed. We can do a quick training for everybody, and then we'll take it up from there.

Kelli:
  Yeah. All right. Great. Excellent. Thank you so much. You're very welcome you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Enjoy the rest of your evening. Have a good Friday and weekend ahead.

Kelli:
  All right. Thank you. Thanks, Rakesh. Bye, bye bye.
