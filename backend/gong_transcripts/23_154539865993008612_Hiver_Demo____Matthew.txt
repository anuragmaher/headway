Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, this is matt with hiver. Can you hear me? Hi, Matthew. Yes. Do you hear me?

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  As well?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes. How you doing?

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  I'm doing fine. Thank you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Yeah, I appreciate it. Sorry for being a little bit late here. Other meeting ran over, but, yeah, let me just pull your profile up here. I see you're in Europe. So it's probably late for you.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  It's nine P. M here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, not terrible, but not great. Fantastic. Got it. So, yeah, agenda for the call, wanted to just help you determine if hiver is a good fit and then provide any information that you have here. So, yeah, tell me a little bit about kind of what's going on, what motivated you to book this call? Well?

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  We are an it coworking space. We're currently operating in two countries, Bulgaria, and Hungary, and we have a customer base of around 2000 people. We don't have huge inbox flow like we get around four to 50 emails per day that's tops. We are currently using another solution. It's called kayaku, I assume you know about it already. We've been using it for a couple of years, but there are several things that we're not happy with. First and foremost is the customer support response rate like whenever we have an issue, it usually takes at least 48 hours for someone to reply even for the first time. And the platform very often goes down or there are bugs that no one can explain, et cetera. Et cetera. The next one is that assuming from the requirements that they've listed, you already know that we are looking for the basic functionality. So currently, we're not very happy with the pricing of kayaku as well. So that's why we're looking at other options. We are realistically looking to switch like our timeline is we want to take the decision by the end of next week. And then we want to switch in February.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And are you using Gmail, Google suite? Yes. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. And yeah, so I got your email here… support two brands, how many shared emails do you plan on using with hiver?

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  We plan on using two emails. Two. Yeah, only two emails, okay? Two emails, one for each brand?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  One for each brand. Okay. Got it. And in this, you want to access the API for integrations with circle?

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Yes. Okay. Honestly, any integration way would work. I mean, even if it's like a third party service like zapier or something like that, we have experience with it. We just need a confirmation that it is going to work somehow and that someone is going to help along the way, if we need it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Let me go ahead and share my screen here.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, first of all, it's directly in Gmail. So you just download the hiver extension and then basically you'll see your personal emails here. And then on the left hand side, you'll see these folders and these folders are going to be connected to those shared emails that you have. So you mentioned you have two. So you'll just have two there.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Okay. On.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Top of that, we have over 200 employees globally. We have 24 seven instant chat support goes to a real person. You'll talk to them within minutes. And then also, you can even book a call with someone on our team same day as well. So if you have any issues or need to talk to someone, you can do.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, we have over 99 percent uptime as well. When it comes to it, we know we're significantly larger company. We have over 10,000 companies using us, you know, small businesses all the way up to some of the largest companies in the world, companies like capital one companies like flexport as well. So our uptime is over 99 percent. So it's not going to go down on you. There's always somebody here that you can talk to. And then as far as the functionality goes, were you, did you already understand how hiver works? Or did you want to see a little bit of that as well?

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Well, I want to see a little bit if you can, if you're here with them.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So basically, once an email comes into that address that you have, this ticket system, pops, this panel pops up on the left hand, right hand side here where you can assign it to each other.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Okay. If I.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  sign this to matt. Matt gets notified and then it's going to land in matt's mind folder here. So everyone has their own mind folder where they can see the work that they've been assigned to them. There's tags to categorize these emails. These are customizable. And both the tags and the assigning can be done via automations as well. So they can automatically get assigned to people. It can automatically get tagged as well. We could do it with domains. We could do it off keywords, the popular one. So, like, for instance, if you handled all the refunds, we can have an automation that says, if the word refund is in the subject or body of the email, then we automatically want it to get assigned to you and automatically get assigned the refund tag.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Okay. So, do we get this for each email separately? Yes?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  There is no way to multiply them in the same inbox?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No. Each inbox has their own automations, their own settings. So, yeah, you would need to do it separately for each one. Yeah.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Because we have people who work on both brands. So they would need to switch between the emails, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's fine.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah… custom fields here. Anything custom you're looking to track note section here, you hit the add mention button. Everyone's name in the account pops up and you can communicate with each other. Like, hey, can you help on this call? Would then get notified? You can reply to emails here directly in hiver. You can reply, you can set it up however you like, but you can reply from the shared address, or you can reply from your personal address.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Okay. We.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  have email templates, you can set up and share with everybody. We have AI features such as AI chat, gpt, and we also have something called an AI copilot which can actually draft email replies for you. Okay? And this learns from past emails, it can also cross reference documents and snippets. So, if you have any standard operating procedures documents, and this is interactive, so you could ask it questions, make it shorter, whatever you want to do?

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Okay. What would you say are the benefits of this type of an interface rather than most other platforms that just work separately as a platform? What would you say are the benefits of integrating directly on Gmail?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just convenience, right? You don't have to go to a separate platform. I could easily answer all my personal emails right here. And if I got something new, I would get notified or if you needed help on an email, I can just like right here, Cole mentioned me on this email. I just click this button and it just takes me right there. And then additionally, I can click on any of these emails right now. I can see all the new emails. And then there's also a team view here, which is going to allow you to see all the emails that need to get done across the entire team.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Yeah. And you can sort them by assignment. I imagine, right? Yeah, exactly.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I can click on Cole here. I can see all the emails I've assigned to Cole. I can see any of the back and forwards, I can see when the email came in. Any changes, right? I can see here, Cole clearly hasn't done anything on this email. So let me just go to a better one here. Yeah, like now, I can come into this one. I can click on, let me click on Alex here. And I can see that, you know, he replied back to this person. I can see when it came in et cetera. I see and I can reply for him.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Yeah. I would say that another benefit is that you don't need to transfer history because we have a rich history with client emails. And with the other platforms that's the issue, there is a limit of knowledge you can transfer to the new platform here. It won't be needed because we already have all the past communication on Gmail.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. Yeah. And then, yeah, once you're done with something, you just move to the closed status here. You'll see this goes from four down to three and there's only 48 emails left. So it's all tied to these statuses right here. Cool. And then lastly, I'd say you can also set up these slas, so maybe for certain emails that you get maybe they're more priority, you can say like, hey, whenever we get an email about cancellation, we want to make sure that email gets replied to within X, amount of hours, say three hours. And if not, we want to be notified that it's late. So that's what these red lightning bolts are.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  I see. How about any sort of reports, like from an admin point of view? Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So reports is analytics. You just click right here. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You just click the timeframe you want to see. It could be custom. Could be last 30 days, last 90 days. And you're going to see things like how many new emails did you get in the last 90 days? How many emails did you resolve in the last month or so? Whatever you pick, and you could group this by person. You could group this by filter, by custom tags, custom fields. You can save these views. You can export all this to excel. You're also going to see the workload across the team. So, like this month, I assigned 24 emails to matt. I assigned 11 to Alex email sent. You can see things by each person. So like their average response times, resolution times… you're going to see with those tags, like how many of those emails did you get? Like last month, we got 50 emails about cancellations, this question, etc.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's going to track the companies emailing in the people emailing in. If you had those SLA set up, you can see things like how many times you violated them. So we violate, yeah, you can see it by person. You're going to have the emails down here to reference there's the csat scores as well. Customer satisfaction surveys, AI, sentiment analysis will let you know the sentiment of the emails that are coming in there's. Aiqa reporting, which allows you to see the AI responses and how it's measuring up to any of these custom AI instructions that you have. There's custom reports, all of this is exportable to a CSV file.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, there's custom dashboards as well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then all the admin settings are in the backend here. So for each mailbox, you can have different settings. You can have different custom fields. You can have different automations, integrations… as well. So, these are the integrations… that we have natively.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Yeah, you have Jira.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Jira.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So that one's there?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, your other one with circles or the other ones, you would have, you'd have to leverage either our API or zapier.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Okay. That won't be an issue. Jira is nice because we actually use Jira. We run the entire operations like following the lean methodology. So we have sprints on Jira, weekly sprints. So we'll be able to connect all conversations to the respective tasks I imagine.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, you can bring through exactly summaries descriptions, projects, issue, type statuses.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Awesome. That's very nice. Actually… honestly, I don't think I have any other questions because what we're looking for is pretty basic. Okay. So, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, a couple of things here. The only thing, you know, you're really, you can look at growth or pro. The only thing is, if you wanted to use the zapier… or the API you would need pro?

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Okay. Can you possibly send me a follow up email with your plan recommendation based on the request and what we've spoke about?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Okay.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Anything else that we need to clear?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, I think that's it. And then as far as next steps go here, I think you mentioned you might have a decision on this next week or? Yeah.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  I am, I have like four, four calls in total and four demos because I selected four tools that I want to try out and I'm going to write the report on Monday, discuss it during the week with the CEO directly and we are aimed at taking the decision by Friday.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. Yeah. And I just say, you know, it's really easy to get up and running set up. You just download it. You connect the mailbox, you invite the users in. And essentially, you're up and running here also for 10 users, pro, you do get onboarding as well. So, you'll have a dedicated contact here who will help you make sure that the account's set up and we have 24 seven support as I mentioned too. So really the top things are just ease of use and the amount of support that we have and the infrastructure we have.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, I'll email all this to you. We'd be able to just put up a follow up call if you have any questions, maybe the same time next week?

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, I'm taking Thursday the fifth at the same time or actually this would be the sixth for you, but yeah, oh, no, this would be the fifth. Okay, awesome. Great. Yeah, I'll email everything to you. Let me know if you have any questions. In the meantime… I'm.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  good for now. Thanks a lot. And your tool looks very interesting. Like the way you set it up, it really stands out from everything I've seen so far.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Appreciate it. Okay. Great. Appreciate it. Bye.

Nadezhda Nedkova (n.nedkova@puzl.com):
  Thanks, Jojo.
