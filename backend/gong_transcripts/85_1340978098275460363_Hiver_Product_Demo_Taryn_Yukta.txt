Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  hi, Yukta.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, Taryn, how are you?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing great. Thank you.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Good, good. Good. Sorry, I think my internet might be a little slow but just let me know if I cut out at any point.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. It's okay. And I think my bandwidth is also not so great. So, let's keep our videos off. If that's okay?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah, that's perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think I wanted to connect since you have started your trial with your finance inbox. Is London psychiatry is like part of add, then multiply itself, like are these like same companies, different entities, so.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  That is actually our client. So add then multiply is a finance outsourcing or insourcing company. And London psychiatry clinic is one of our clients. So we manage the finance department for that client.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Understood. So, are they hosted on Google workspace itself? They are.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Hosted on Google workspace. Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Great. Yeah. Okay. And you would be accessing this inbox by logging from your email address, which is add then?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah. So that's where I had a question for you actually. So the inbox is currently accessed by through the London psychiatry clinic email. So they're through their Google workspace, they've given us a login username and password, and we all access it through there. But we are currently a team of three and growing because the client is growing as well. So what is the best way for us to access that for each individual to access?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do these people have their own email address like you do?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  They have, they only have it under add then multiply, not under London psychiatry clinic. With London psychiatry clinic. We all share one login.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So when you're responding, you wouldn't be, you would want to respond from the same email address, right? London psychiatry?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that's going to be a tricky situation because you have add then multiply as the user, you add them, you would have the option to be able to reply. So this is how it works, right? Okay. Great timing. Sorry, hi, Ying. Hi, Ying. How are you? Just give me a moment as I'm just logging into my.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Sure. Ying is also on our team, and she was also one of the people who would access this mailbox but yeah, she's just tagging along to see what we're after.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. No problem at all. Let me just log in here. So what I'm trying to say is that you will, I mean as you're replying to the emails, and since these are different domains, Gmail will not allow you to be able to reply using the shared mailbox email address. Had it been the same domain, there wouldn't have been any problem.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  But when.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  you're working on any email, and when you're replying here, so that's how, you know, usually it happens, right? And you can reply using your own email address or the shared mailbox email address, you see the domains are same, right? In both. But in your situation, since the domains are different Gmail, for security reasons, would not be able to know whether London psychiatry is same as add, then multiply, or are these different entities or different companies, which it is, right? So you have two options. Either you onboard a solution which is Gmail agnostic, which means you don't have to have an email address. You just create a shared mailbox with this email address, anybody can log in with their own credentials and they start working on that inbox. So that would be one. And otherwise, if you want to use hiver and remain in your Gmail, in that case, so you'll have to write to the Google support telling them that, you know, add, then multiply and this domain are the same and belongs to the same company. So that then they'll allow you to be able to use them interchangeably here. Yeah.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah. Well, yeah, they definitely are not the same company. So another solution would be for London psychiatry clinic to set up an email address for each person in our team.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  would then be able to all access it because we'll be under the same domain, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. That would be like an ideal scenario.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Okay. Understood.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Would they be open to that idea to buy you licenses?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  I'm not sure because.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I have never seen that happening. So I'm not sure if that would be possible.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah, it's a question. We've put the question out there. We'll see what they say as a response. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You could do that or otherwise, if they say no, in that case, you might want to look at something like front or some tool that is like not sitting on any email, rather have their own standalone solution with the ability for anyone to be able to log in using their credentials rather than their email addresses. So then you can easily manage this inbox.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah, yeah. No, understood. Okay, perfect. And then just in terms of setup, so we obviously still want to continue trying. Thank you by the way for helping us extend the free trial.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Definitely want to continue trialing it and using it… do.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You want to share your screen? I can help you with the setup. I know that you have added yourself as the user, you have set up the inbox as well, which is great. Okay. If you want to share your screen, we can delete the demo inbox, you can add Ying as well so that she can also try and see how it works.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  I have shared the login with you in the meantime. So these little gray tags that we're seeing are those from the demo inbox because I just could not figure out how to get rid of them.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  The gray labels are going to be there as it is, these ones. Yeah. So these are the labels that hiver use in order to sort of, you know, sync your inbox and give this view here in hiver.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Okay. So, but if we, obviously, the place we want to be is in this little section that we created, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So those labels, you don't have to be in touch that's not going to be there.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Okay. So you say we need to delete the demo?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So for that, you can go into the admin panel?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah. Click on.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That hiver icon next to the bell icon?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Admin panel, yep.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Admin panel, go to shared inboxes on the left and hover over demo inbox extreme, right? There is a delete button. Click on that and type delete demo inbox?

Ying (ying@addthenmultiply.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then you delete this. So this is done. I think Ying has put in some, could you show us how we can download a report, current trial result?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah. Ying is interested in the analytics side of things as well. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, since you have been using it in terms, see now you wouldn't really get any analytics because it's just one user that you have added so far, which is yourself. But if you want to get those analytics, you would just come back from here, go into analytics. This is where you'll get all the reports from the time that you have started using hiver. So this is where you can then manage it, see the workload. But currently, are you assigning emails and doing everything in hiver? I don't think so.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  We just started, we just started with that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So when you're doing it, you have a week now anyway. So after a week, in terms of whatever you have done and performed in hiver, you can download that report. You have that export option on the left. Yeah, I saw that. So you can export any report that you would be interested in.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  You can create some custom reports as well if we need to.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, perfect.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Okay. We can see it's in this response times where's the sign. So the most important thing is obviously assign it for it to be assigned. And then to update the status. Yes. As soon as we've actioned something in there. Yeah. And then.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I see that you have not accepted the invite Taryn from your Gmail account. Currently, you're logged in into finance itself.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah, I've tried to accept it, but when I go in there and it looks like it's accepted, but then I can't actually log in and I don't know if that's a domain issue or maybe LPC is blocking me. Somehow. I'm not sure.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do you want to go to your Gmail open your Gmail account?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Sure. Let me just stop sharing. Okay. Do, do.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  I think it's okay. I mean, we can try and do that, but we wouldn't want to connect this atm once because we shouldn't be replying from our atm emails anyway.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, yeah, that would be irrelevant. Yeah.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  So that's actually, but here within.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  The finance inbox, and if you're just using it, then you wouldn't be able to assign emails to yourselves because there is no one to assign to.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah, until we've added actual users there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Okay. Now that's perfect. Ying, do you have any other questions?

Ying (ying@addthenmultiply.com):
  No, I'm just more interested about what is the current kind of, you know, I know we haven't fully tried it out but, you know, even without this one week, I just wanted to know what does the report capture? And obviously, now you've given me the access to look at the data, then I can probably see more, you know, have more transparencies on this. Yeah. But right this moment in time, all I see is just lots of gray.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah. So once you log into the right way as you did now, you won't see that gray. You'll just see all the lovely colors that we have set up there and the little Smiley faces and things as well.

Ying (ying@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah. I mean, it's just like, you know, for example, this morning, as I mentioned, like, you know, gawa, I mean, does she still need to manually intervene to say that's been assigned to me as an email?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  She doesn't yeah, she doesn't I have just on my call with her, reminded her that she doesn't have to do that. So, we have the user set up. She shouldn't have to do that. Yeah.

Ying (ying@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yukta, how much longer the trial you are giving to us?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think it started last week. What exactly you want to see in terms of the report? Seeing?

Ying (ying@addthenmultiply.com):
  I just wanted to see, are we actually responding? Well, are we actually managed to get those, you know, to the right person who's responsible for the task and get things done?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. But for that, you have to first add the users, right? We don't have any users added yet. So you wouldn't be able to fetch those reports until we add the users to the account.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  But we're starting to use it now Ying. So the main user is going to be Hawa, she's going to be the one with the LPC link. So she at least will be able to track her things in there until we've agreed with LPC that we can add, give us access or give us LPC email addresses, but we will be able to track all of Hawa's things and she's the main one working on the inbox anyway and.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  She has the domain email address.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yes, she does. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Then she can be added to this and then she would be able to assign everything and then you can see everything there in terms of how we are responding, how much time we are taking and all those analytics.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Exactly. Awesome. Okay. Well, we'll keep going. Hopefully, we'll be able to sort out the user things as soon as possible, but we'll keep going and then we'll update you on Monday again. Yukta. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That sounds great. Do you want to connect on Monday? Should I put some time?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah, we can put something in the diary. I'm not sure if Ying wants to join.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can we do at the same time as today?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Let me just double check… or if we.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Could do a 15 minute earlier than today?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  15 minutes earlier. I'm actually not. Yeah, I wouldn't be able to do that. I can do one P. M UK time, three P. M South African time, or at… two UK time, three P. M4 P. M South African time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Three P. M South African time, right?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  That's I think six? Oh, no, not. Yeah, yeah, either three or four.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Four is like same as right now, right? In south.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Africa. Yeah, four is, yeah, four is the current time in a minute from now would be four? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Four. I already have a meeting, so, can we do at three?

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah, that works for me. Ying, does one P. M work for you if you want to join?

Ying (ying@addthenmultiply.com):
  No, if, I join just, you can invite me, but right this moment, I can't say I will.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Okay. But Ying, I'll also keep you updated on what we're doing as well.

Ying (ying@addthenmultiply.com):
  Yeah, please. Okay.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  Awesome. All right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Thank you so much. Yeah, let me know the feedback as we connect next week.

Taryn April (taryn@addthenmultiply.com):
  I will do that. Thank you very much.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Thank you. Bye bye.

Ying (ying@addthenmultiply.com):
  Bye bye.
