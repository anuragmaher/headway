Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  hello?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hey, Paul. Good afternoon.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Good afternoon. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well, sir. No complaints. How are you doing?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, good. Thank you. I'm sorry, I don't know why my video is not working. Everything says… it should be. So, I don't… quite understand.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's fine. Sir. I mean, it could be something technical that's fine. Yeah, but I can hear you loud and clear. I mean, that's the most important bit.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. Sorry about that. As I say, everything says it should be working. Yeah. So, okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Nothing to worry. Alright, now, we met already in the month of September. I remember our conversation. You said you're going to be looking at chitbed. I think you subscribed to their plan as well.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, I did, and you were right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. I mean, I'm glad we are talking again and I'm happy to solve all of these problems for you. Now. Are you already out of chitbed's subscription today? Or are you still with them for an annual contract? I mean, where do we stand today in terms of the billing with chitbed folks?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Sorry. Can you say that again?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Alright. Let me rephrase. Are you still in the billing with chitbed? Have you stopped using it? Are you on a monthly or an annual contract with them?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Oh, right. No. I went on a monthly but I've stopped it already because it simply isn't working for us at all?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now that I've already seen that you have set up hiver, invited your two mailboxes, VIP, support and calendar at the rate inbox, all of the folks are already invited into hiver. Could I understand what timelines you're looking at this time around? Are you looking to make a decision right after the trial?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, I think I've made the decision to go ahead. You know, I've still got one team member to add on Monday, but the other two seem quite happy with it… although I think I've set it up the wrong way or there could be a better way of setting it up.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I was actually noticing that. So give me one minute. Okay. Let me just quickly check your account and we'll be using today's time to help you rectify the setup wherever needed. Okay? I saw that you logged in into your inbox, which is calendar at the rate and set up hiver instead of setting it up on your own personal inbox. Okay. Well, that can be taken care of. Give me a second. Again. Okay. VIP. Okay. Julie, and David, Julie is yet to log into hiver?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, Julie is the one I'm going to set up on Monday.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. But you have not added yourself to hiver. I mean, okay.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, actually, because I'm not the shall I explain, how I thought I wanted it set up? Yeah?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Essentially, we have David and Julie who are going to be the biggest users by far.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. And they're mainly working in bookings?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Which is the busiest part. Their bookings. Sorry, bookings at take that photo is where all the university students book their time slots. The email comes through, confirming that, but also if they've got any queries or anything on about the day or anything else. So, to give you some idea, we deal with 66,000 students. Not all of them obviously come in, but we do get maybe five to 10 inquiries per university. And so that comes into bookings, or I want it to come into bookings. VIP support is mainly K, okay. Who'll be looking after that? Okay? But VIP support as a separate user as an email was for our staff to log in on site in actually university to basically… check what David and Julie have said to each individual or how they've replied basically using tags, they'd search the tag for that university, see what emails that they've sent. And then that's it. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, one quick question before we move forward, the VIP support inbox is the user inbox, I understand. But at the university level, who are the folks who are logging into VIP support?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Basically, it's our manager who's on site?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Is the manager not a part of hiver setup yet?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, I haven't got him set up. I didn't yes, I didn't think about that actually.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, with regards to the setup, let me explain. Okay. Now, VIP support is going to be a shared inbox for us. So nobody would be using a common login for logging into VIP support that's not needed. The actual manager will be looking at the emails coming into the VIP support, which ideally you said K would be managing it. Yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Well, this is it. Hold on a second. I'm thinking this isn't particularly about money or how many users I've got. I just really want to be able to set.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  it up in the perfect fashion first of all.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, it's basically, yeah, VIP support. I envisaged it being an email from K that would go out to customers that needed. I say more traditional, you know, company support and such.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So we don't require VIP support to be a user in hiver. We would rather keep K as a user and the actual manager on the site to be a part of the VIP support inbox though, K would use it heavily, but the manager would also be able to see the emails which are going out with the context. K is actually writing to these customers.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  That's it basically, yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Fair enough. And is there a particular reason we added calendar at the rate as a user in hiver? Because that is the inbox, isn't it?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, no, I absolutely agree. I set up hiver under that because it said it needed admin level.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me help you rectify that, Paul. You better be the administrator and user in hiver. You don't really need calendar at the rate inbox for, you know, a user login. We're just adding another extra space. Let me assist you. Do you mind sharing your screen… there's? A green button in zoom?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, not at all. I'll just have to figure out how.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. If you're on zoom screen, there is a green button at the bottom middle that says, share. Yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Screen one. Yeah, wait a minute. Let me turn my other screen. I've got two screens on there. We go. Right there we go. Thank you. Thanks.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. You might want to just zoom out a little bit otherwise. Okay. Never mind. I'll do it on my screen itself. Okay. Yeah. Now, you're logged in into calendar at the rate. Okay. Could you take me to hiver settings here? The logo on the top?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Admin panel?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Oh, sorry.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Shared inboxes, extreme left here?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, first of all, take me to the bookings inbox. All right now, I see we have these many users managing the booking inbox. We absolutely don't require calendar at the rate email, but your email address, Paul. So let's go ahead and add yourself, which is Paul at the rate your company domain email.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Your email address basically?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Please invite. Now, give me a minute. Can we go to users and roles please? Okay. Could you ensure that you have invited Paul as administrator here? Could you make him in the admin? Okay. Fair enough. We are the admin. And what I would want you to do is just log in into another window, but in your email address, which is Paul at the rate.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Probably that. Sorry, there we go.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. So log into your, open your email.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Sorry, we keep crossing. What would you like me to do?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, instead of logging into VIP calendar, could you log in into your inbox, which is Paul at the rate inbox, please?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  It's not that one. Is it? It's a new?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  One, I believe that's the admin. Yeah, but go ahead. Yes, this one, please. Now, could you take me to Gmail?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, sorry.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Oh, my God. It's been a while. Sorry, I usually log in as calendar.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries with hiver. You would never need to log in into inboxes. You would log in straight off into your personal email, and from there, you would manage the multiple inboxes.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Oh, you've.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  got good mammary.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah. Should I install the hiver Chrome?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes. Now, yeah, if you could. Okay. Well, actually, you don't have to do this, you would receive an invite in your personal inbox that you're already invited into hiver. So, if you could, yeah, I mean, if you click on the first email that you see there invitation to join hiver? Yes, has been added to the mailbox. Could you look at the second email? Just go back and… okay, install hiver for Gmail, that's a straightforward go add to Chrome.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now that you're part of hiver, it will take another minute to sync everything. Yeah, sign in with Google, just a one time activity, authenticate your email. We are good to go. Okay. All right now, what we want to do is if you take me to the settings again and the admin panel… in the shared inboxes… for bookings. First of all, let's… go ahead and remove this calendar at the rate user. We don't require this as a user. By the way… yeah, just remove.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Oh, sorry. Yeah, no.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Worries?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  I'm looking elsewhere. Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And also VIP support is going to be the case login, right?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Hey, he's logging?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So let's get back to this later. First of all, let's just solve one problem at a time. Let's go to users and roles please. I want to make sure there's no confusion. So, calendar, at the rate inbox, can you tick this box and delete this user?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Yeah, that's okay to say setup whatever that's not even needed. All right now, David is going to be looking at both the inboxes virtual as well as the second inbox, same as Julie then, Kay?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  I think all of them just in case if that's okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Absolutely. That's fine. That's absolutely fine. Now, this is what I'm actually concerned about now, VIP support using as an added user is not going to help us instead. I would rather add the manager here who is on site.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, I'm just do.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You have the email address for that user?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  For the manager?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Huh.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, he's part of, yeah, he's on Google workspace with us.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Actually. Okay. So, let's go ahead and remove this as a user as well?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  That, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Delete.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You don't have to give any reason to skip, add a user?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Where are we? Oh, yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And put in the manager's email address here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, let him be member, only invite him to the VIP inbox. Let,

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  me take this phone call because this is to do with me this as well. Okay. Go ahead. Yeah… I'm actually, oh, yes, I'm actually online with them at the moment. Yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah. You're okay with everything basically, yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah. Okay. All right. Great. Yes, I know. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Cheers. Bye. Yeah. Sorry, I was that's, David kitchen, okay? And I set him up last night and he's not very good at technical. So, and he said, I've got actually nothing to, you know, say really about it. He said it's very easy, very straightforward and it's just working. Yeah. So that's good news.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, great. Thank you. Yeah. And you don't even have to worry about users being technical or non technical. We are anyways going to be taking care of a quick training for everybody. So don't worry about that. You're covered with that.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Good, good. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let's go back to shared inboxes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let's make sure everything is working now in the shared inbox, first of all, for your VIP support, can you click here? You have got basically all the users who are still going to be a part of VIP support, but you said Kay is going to be a heavy user of that inbox and your actual manager, which is Dwayne I guess. Yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  They're also going to be looking at these emails that Kay is working on, but Julie Paul, yourself and David are still going to have access to it. If they don't require it, you can always remove them by the way from VIP support inbox.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, no, I understand how to do that. Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Now, let's go back to the second inbox. Can you click again on the shared inbox for me? Now, this is your actual bookings inbox, which is connected to your email address, calendar at the rate, exactly.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Exactly.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I want to make sure that it's not bookings at the rate but calendar at the rate inbox.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Sorry, that should be bookings shouldn't it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, what is this email address then?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  That's actually the admin address for Google workspace. It was just, we don't use it at all. Really. Okay. It was something that was set up a long time ago originally in Google workspace. We didn't start with Google workspace. It was just set up as that for the calendar, I think with a total lack of understanding, but it left the account there. So, when I decided to go to Google workspace, it's now, you know, it was the easiest way to create Google workspace. Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me quickly make sure that we are receiving emails into this inbox by the way, when customers… your students or anybody who is wanting to contact you for booking, do they send email to calendar at the rate or booking at the rate inbox? No?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Nothing. The only way you can get a calendar, take that photo is to send a direct email to it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, into calendar at the rate email address?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, it really isn't used for anything. Okay. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, what are we? Okay? Now, do we have email address, which is bookings at the rate inbox?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Do we have email address? Yeah, we have bookings at take that photo.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. But that's not yet set up in hiver, if I could see this actually, no.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  I thought I did here there exactly there, but, yeah, no.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It's not actually, it's not now, this setup says as, and when there is an email which is sent to calendar at the rate, take my photo. Yeah, it's going to be managed in hiver for all the users, but this is not somehow connected to bookings. I mean, if I send an email to bookings at the rate email address, I would not see those emails in hiver. Because that's not even the setup.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, let's go ahead and set up the shared inbox. For bookings?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Create an inbox.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Sorry?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You see the option that says create shared inbox right below your profile in Gmail. Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah. Email. Now, give it a name called bookings?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Same.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I mean, I would differentiate it by bookings original, just say, yeah, at the rate. Yeah, we just need a differentiator here that's all. Okay, support. Okay. Fair enough. You could just say sales as well, however you want it. Next. Now, there's a quick important part. Here. Is this bookings at the rate email address, a user account with a password or is this a Google group which does not have a password? Or is this an alias?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  It's an alias?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, you don't have password for bookings at the rate email?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, I'm pretty sure. Do you want me to check?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  If you could, that would help us set it up appropriately? Okay?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Ugh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you ever log in into booking at the rate inbox, I can help you with that.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Calendar. Sorry?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Huh.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Oh, yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Oh, where did it go? Okay?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Thank you.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, it's a user.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, you have a password for it actually?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, sorry. It's an alias. Thank you. It's an alias bookings. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. But I don't see bookings here. I mean, which one are you referring to?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, as I say, it's an alias of?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You don't have? Okay, fair enough. Okay. Let's go back to Gmail. Setup again, hiver setup. I think. Okay.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  I'll just double check. Yeah, there it is. Bookings. Yeah, it is in the,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let's go to hiver… yeah, and shared in boxes. I think, we were on a different screen because.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Except because I've logged out.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Huh. No worries. We can go ahead and set up again, create shared inbox.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, but there were no, it's not. Okay.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Well,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  yeah, it's a second option.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Email address, bookings at the rate?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Oh, hang on. I'm… signed here at calendar. I'm on the wrong thing.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that does not matter because it will ask you to log in into bookings once we are going to be authenticating it. So that's fine.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  It doesn't matter.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it would not create any confusion. Don't worry.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. Just.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Click on create shared inbox again, email bookings at the rate… next?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Choose your email address next?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Mismatch. Okay?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Left hand side, I.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  See the error here. Allow me with a minute. Let me involve one of my engineers. Give me a minute, please?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  In the meanwhile, Paul, a support engineer is joining me. Can you take me to the main Gmail screen? Just cancel this setup. It's fine. Just close this window… and close this admin panel.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Could you take me to the bookings inbox just once?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Close this. All right. Now. Do you see that I, okay. Do you see that I also sent you a test email too, that's right there in your inbox?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Sorry, click on that. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Well, I did send this email to bookings and it is actually landing right here. Though. This inbox is actually connected to your calendar at the rate. Are you forwarding by any chance? Emails from calendar at the rate? Email address to this bookings at the rate inbox?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yes, I'm pretty sure it is forwarded. Okay. Do you want me to check?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. If you could, then we are not going to be duplicating anything. And this could be the reason that we could have, I mean we got into the error, so we would like to first of all, make sure if these emails have been routed from calendar at the rate inbox, into bookings, then we are all sorted because you're basically getting all these emails into the bookings inbox. Okay? Let me explain that again. I mean, I don't want to confuse you and I've got Aishwarya from our support team. I'll explain that real quick, Aishwarya. What's exactly the scene here is that we have one shared inbox set up using calendar at the rate email address. Okay. I sent an email to bookings at the rate that did land inside the shared inbox now, I'm assuming it could be the forwarding rule or if you want to help Paul ascertain if we are all good to go with the setup because actually the email address that our customers will be using is bookings at the rate, take that photo co, UK. But somehow, when we procured Google workspace, that was set up using email address, calendar at the rate, which is the main email address for the workspace account. And this is the same email address that we used to create an inbox. Yeah. Okay.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, I understand. I'm just going where to look at the forwarding.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, calendar is a Google group, right? Or is it proper? I think it's a user account? OK?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  It's an account?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, calendar is a user account. By the way… bookings at the rate inbox email address is a group. It's an alias.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  I'm on calendar.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, most certainly, I'm assuming that the emails which are sent to bookings at the rate is actually forwarded to the calendar inbox, which is why we are able to see these emails in iworld.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, I am trying to. Oh, all right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Aishwarya. Would you want to help us? Where do we find the forwarding rules by the way?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, I'm trying, yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Hi, Paul.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Hi, you. Okay?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  You can look for it over here as well. Otherwise you can just try opening up the bookings itself. It's a Gmail account, right?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yes, no, it's an,

Aishwarya Uppal:
  alias, and it's an alias of calendar. Yes. OK. So let's open up the calendar itself, the Gmail account for calendar and let's check if there is any forwarding rule over there.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah. I'm there now, I'm inside.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  I can't really see that screen. I can see your admin console at the moment.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  OK, Paul, I think we are mentioning you to log in into your calendar at the right inbox.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  All right. Hold on a second, because.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Give me two secs. This is getting too big. Oh.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Give up. OK. Let's try this. Sorry, where am I going?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  I'm trying. OK, let's do one quick thing. First, go to your own Gmail account… go to the Gmail account of yours? The first tab on the very top left hand side?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Is.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  there any email, which? OK, is this the example email?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I just sent it to bookings at the rate and it is syncing in. Well, but if you notice this inbox is set up using calendar at the rate email address.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Got it. And Paul, on the right hand side, you'll see a three dot icon. If you can click on that just besides the reply option.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  So, do you see it says, yes, that's the one and no, try clicking on that, the three dot icon you have clicked on the very top, the one which is circled by Rakesh?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you see this one? Paul? No, no, no, not here. We don't have to go.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Sorry. No.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Worries. Yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yes, and click on show original. The last option. That one. Yes, perfect. And the one in the green on the very top which says message id. Can you copy that and share it with me? I'll check the logs and I'll help you out.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Copy it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, copy this one.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  And share.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It on zoom chat itself. Okay? I'm dropping you a quick note on hi, message on zoom. So share that with us.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Did you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Get the zoom chat option or not?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Let me do something because you're not seeing something I'm seeing, which is a… I may have to rejoin because I've messed everything. It's my screen actually. I may use another screen. Hold on a second.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. You don't have to struggle through this. I sent you a test email, right? You got the message id for that test email. Just write back to the email. I'll get the logs.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  There it is. Chat. Yeah, here we go.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Perfect. All right. Thanks, Paul. Give me a few minutes. Let me quickly check what's going on?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  I'm moving something else and then I'll be able to see the screen properly and be able to, right? Sorry, what did you say again? Apologies?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We're just going to be testing it internally. Checking the logs, give us another minute please.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Ah, right. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I've sent you another test email on bookings at the rate with this specific subject, Rakesh testing for Paul, and then hiver, let's go into the Gmail, the very first screen. Okay? All.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Not one.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, I don't think you have hiver running here, are you?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, this is hold on a sec. I've got the wrong one.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Which email is this?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  This one?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Just cross this one. Go back to the main Gmail screen bookings inbox. Yeah, you see that email on the top inbox here? Okay? And in the bookings, I want to make sure that these are not even duplicate emails for you. Click on bookings.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you see my email address? My test email? Okay. Yeah, I see everything is working. Okay? We just need to make sure that these are not duplicated for your personal inbox as well as bookings. So, if emails are sent to bookings address, it should not reflect in your personal emails. So that's where I see it's, actually sending you the copies also, which is a confusion. So, we want to just sort that as well and let Aishwarya also quickly check that at the back end. Okay? But it looks like the setup is all perfect by the way, if somebody is contacting you at bookings at the rate email, you are getting those emails in the unassigned by the way.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Right. Yep. Okay. So we're set basically, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We are good to go. But there are a couple of things I would want to help you improvise because I'm seeing these emails in your personal inbox also, which could be a reason that any email that is sent to bookings at the rate is also forwarded to you. So we want to make sure that you're not looking at two different emails like, I mean, same email, but in two different places, it's a confusion.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  That would be fantastic if we could. Yeah, because that is actually one of the things I was going to ask but, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Because your personal inbox, only talks about. It should absolutely talk about an email that is sent to Paul at the rate email address and not, bookings should be dealt separately from the inbox here.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Brilliant. Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. We'll just wait for another quick minute. Let Aishwarya come back… and I'm getting all the thank you notifications with the ticket number and everything. I think that's set up under hiver.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yes, I've been able to do that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. No worries. Yeah… we'll also help you with a couple of tags, auto tagging of emails. We'll look at all the emails that you receive in your bookings at the rate, what variety and category of emails you received? Yeah. And we add those.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Again, David kitchen, it was one small question. Is there a limit to tags, how many tags?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  There's no limit. Nope. Okay.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  All right. That's fine.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Hi, Paul. I'm back. Hi, Paul, as you mentioned previously, also that bookings is an alias of calendar. Ideally, if any email is sent to bookings, it would come into the bookings shared inbox. And because bookings is created as calendar, it's syncing all those emails. Can we remove it as an alias that those emails which are sent specifically to the booking alias address would not show up in the calendar, which is booking in the shared inbox.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Have I confused?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  You.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  a little, I'm just reading what you've said?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. So, within hiver, you have created a shared inbox, which is named as bookings, but the email address is calendar at the rate.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let's go back to the Gmail's hiver settings here that'll help you visualize what we're saying? Okay, take us to hiver.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, I think I understand what you're saying because it's an alias and I put it under calendar? Yeah, it's causing the problem. Yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Correct. Would you want your emails? If any of your customer emails on the booking at the rate email address, would you want it to come and show up in this shared inbox? In hiver?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It is actually happening. Yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  But do you want it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we want it because customers do not send us emails on calendar? Okay. Let me give you more clarity. Customers. Do not send emails to calendar at the rate inbox. Okay? They only know bookings at the rate email address, which is out to the world where university contacts us with students, any supplier, even if I need any service from Paul. I'll contact him at bookings at the rate email.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. So, what's the problem, Rakesh?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Actually, hang on a second. Hang on, hang on.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  It is, we do use it by the looks of it… there. Can you see that?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. And this is the auto response, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, that's the auto response with a thank you note and the booking id. So,

Aishwarya Uppal:
  that will go through from the shared inbox address, which is calendar because calendar is the email address.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah. Look, you can see my screen here, yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yes.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Or we get a lot of these. Sorry, I thought this went to bookings. It's actually coming into calendar?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. But isn't bookings also an alias of the calendar email address?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yes.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  So, ideally, it would come over here.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  So, ideally say that again?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. Let me explain again, you have a shared inbox, okay? And the email address that you have used is calendar at the rate bookings at the rate is an alias within calendar. So, any email, if you're sending it out to bookings, it will also show up in calendar, which is the shared inbox that you have created within hiver. Okay? So that would happen, would you want it to not come over here or would you want it to come over here? I'm still confused on this part because the auto response that will get sent out, it will use the shared inbox address.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. No, I would prefer bookings. Com or bookings, co, UK, alias email, come directly into bookings.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yeah. Then the shared inbox is created correctly? Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, this is where we thought we would require your help. Aishwarya. Basically, the shared inbox setup is done on calendar at the rate, although because we have settings at the back end enabling us alias, which is why we are still looking at these emails, but calendar at the rate, email address, should never be used even to send the autoresponders the ticket numbers and everything. It should display bookings at the rate email address, because the world knows us by bookings at the rate email address.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Understood. Then let's redo the setup. Paul, will it be okay if we can delete the shared inbox and recreate it or it will be a problem because you already have?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me tell you, Aishwarya, what we tried doing it before I invited you, I tried helping Paul connect a shared inbox with the bookings email address, and we got an error notification and that error was basically a connection failed like duplicity of it actually.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. Can you share the email address for booking? Let me check if there's something else somewhere else, it's added.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, that's bookings at the rate company domain address. I'll share that with you, Paul, just give me one minute. Okay. Let me just share the email address with her.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm sorry, it's taking a little more than expected. Usually, it's never the case, but let's just quickly go ahead and fix this for you.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, it's my apology. I'm sorry?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Aishwarya. I've dropped you a quick note on slack.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Perfect.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. We don't have any record of booking. So, let's try resetting up the shared inbox and let's see what's going on with the error message as well. Paul, I'll make sure that we get this resolved on this call itself. Try navigating back to the hiver admin panel.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yes, that's the icon admin panel, shared inbox. Yeah, no worries. And once again, so let's first go back and delete this inbox.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. Just one quick question. Somebody's got a lot of work in there. Will that cause a problem or will the emails just reappear back there?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  No. So the emails will show up in every team members, the all mail section. It will be in the Gmail account, but will not show up within the shared inbox. Will that be okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, it will create a turbulence to the existing team workflow.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. We've got to get this, right? Delete it. Yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. Let's delete it.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Try refreshing your Gmail page once, try clicking on control shift R or command shift R together?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Sorry… control shift.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  R.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Perfect. Let's go back to the admin panel.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Why can't it? Oh, yeah. There. Yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Perfect. Shared inboxes… on the right hand side, you'll see create shared inbox. All right. Let's add bookings. Yeah, you have added at the rate by the way, do you want that at the rate present? Because that's just the name?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can do that later as well. That's fine. Let's go ahead and set it up?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. Let's select the second option connect a Google group or alias. Perfect. Add the email address over here, bookings at the rate?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Next.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  That's mainly.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Perfect. Let's click on. Done. All right. Perfect. This is done. Now, we'll try closing the admin panel.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Awesome. All right. I'm going to try sending a test email to the bookings. Yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Found the.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  so, you want me to?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I have sent a test email, Paul. We're just making sure that everything is all good under the bookings inbox. Now… one thing for sure. We've got to go inside the booking inbox and do the SLA setup and, you know, autoresponder setup and everything that I'll definitely help you with apologies because the setup wasn't correct. So we have to kind of just do it again. But, yeah, okay. So.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  There it is. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. And now the autoresponders would also start to go from bookings at the rate. It would not display the calendar. Let's go ahead and set it up. Can you take me to the admin setup one more time? Shared inboxes, bookings at the rate inbox, let's go to the autoresponders.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  That's automations, isn't it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Did you do that under the autoresponders or automations?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Ah, I haven't used this. I used automations. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, autoresponder you turned it on. Sorry. So there's an on button and, yeah… you could just type in the exact content here and pick up the auto ticket id from the variable here.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. Do I the,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  same note. I believe that's thank you for contacting. Let me send you a quick snippet of it. Okay? On zoom chat, so you can just copy paste. Yeah, I think I'll have it somewhere… you can refer to zoom chat. I've sent it to you already.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Zoom chat. Yes, I've got that. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But do remove the ticket id from there, and instead we'll pick up the auto variable.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Right. Hold on.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Remove the ticket id and instead just pick the auto variable at the bottom and insert conversation id. There you go.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Save. Okay. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And we don't require automations to do that. I mean, this is just a straightforward automation, right? Yeah. Okay. That's another way and I'm glad you could figure out that makeshift, that's not a straightforward autoresponder that's another way, you could always do that.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Under the automations, we might want to go and look into if you automatically want to add the tags or however you want to do that, but the tags have to be there in the bookings inbox first. Do you recall of all the different automations that were there?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, I did. I had a look around. I was going to do that later. I mean, no.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Worries. Yeah, we can. Yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But for now, we are all set. This is the perfect setup that you have all your users added to the right inboxes now, mind it? Nobody's going to be logging into VIP support or bookings in the right inbox or calendar. Rather people will stick to their personal Gmail inboxes.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah. So really simply, they're logging into their own Gmail account, but they automatically have access to hiver.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Exactly. They have access to the bookings inbox and VIP support inbox from within their Gmail inboxes.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Whatever you've allocated to them. Yeah, absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Last bit, Aishwarya, we need your help on the emails were also sent to Paul's, personal email address for bookings at the right inbox, if you take me to the personal inbox, sir. So we want to make sure that these emails are not sinking into the personal inbox. It's just a duplicity and confusions.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yeah, sure. I'll definitely help you with that, Paul, if you can once again navigate to the admin panel. Also, by the way, I did notice when I was checking the older shared inbox, there was a forwarding filter for Paul's address that may have caused it as well. But there is another setting also that I want to check quickly on the bottom, you'll see settings on the left hand side panel. If you can click that… and click on feature access… in the middle panel, sorry.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Worries. Okay. So, do you see this option which says shared inbox copy to inbox and task assignment, can you toggle that option off? Yeah, perfect. Looks good. Rakesh, if you don't mind, can you send one more test email?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And Paul, you can also turn on the out of office in case your team members are not available for a specific day, they can manage their availability, and you can see how many people are in my team working today, and they are scheduling out of office and these emails won't be getting assigned to them. So that's an important thing, I mean, you might want to consider.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. No, because we send the 24 hour, no, it's good to know. I'll have a look at that. I'm making a note. Okay? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  I don't want to give them the opportunity to, not to answer.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, no, that's very subjective. Thank you for flagging that up, fair enough.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. There we go. Oh, yeah, come out. Yeah. Okay. So, looks like that. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I have sent you one more test email that should just appear in your inbox now?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Go to inbox. Yeah, there.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, that's the email, but does that reflect in your inbox as well?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yes. Sorry. Yes, it does. I think.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, actually, we do have it here.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Teacher, can you try opening that email once?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Oh, sorry?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  It's still there?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yes, I'm still here. All right. So, I do see the inbox label has got applied to this email. Okay? And… right?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Can you click on the very first email? The one that Rakesh has sent you in the same thread in the same thread?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, that one?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yes, try clicking on that. Okay. Can you share the message id for this? The same method that we used last time? Click on the three dot icon.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  I'm trying to remember where is it?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  On the right hand side, the three dot icon on the right hand side, just besides the reply option.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  You won't. But, yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Just give me a second. Yes, that's the one. If you can copy it and paste it within the chat.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Paul, I have a next customer meeting in two minutes. Is that okay if Aishwarya helps you out and I want to send another invite for us to connect on Monday. Make sure everything is all set up and done and we invite the team for the training. Does that sound good?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yes, thank you so much for your help. I appreciate it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. I wish I could have spent more time but it's just that my customer is already there at the foyer.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, no, no, no. You've spent. Yeah, it's fine. Absolutely. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. You're welcome. Aishwarya. Please go ahead. Assist us here. And Paul, I'm sending you an invite for Monday around the same timing?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. Lovely. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, sorry?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Hold on. I'm away Monday and Tuesday.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let's do that on Tuesday.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Wednesday?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You're back in on Wednesday?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  I know I've got another appointment. Let me go. Sorry, let,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  me, no worries. No worries. Just let me know what time works for you?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Can I have a look, yeah… I'll have a look and I'll email you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I will, you know what? I'll drop your, thank you email with my calendar to choose the timing that works absolutely fine for you on Wednesday?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Thank you for your time. Aishwarya. I will still go ahead and help you with that. Yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you so much, Aishwarya.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Most welcome. Take care.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Bye, bye bye.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Rakesh. Paul, give me just two minutes. I'm just checking the logs on what's going on. Just give me two minutes.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, sure.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  All right. So, I see what's the problem. So, Gmail is basically adding an important label to this particular email, marking it as important so that it's assuming that it's an important email. And that's why the inbox label on the very top has got applied by Gmail. And that is why this email is showing up in your primary inbox. Paul, we can fix this by just modifying your existing Gmail filter.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Try.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Clicking on the gear icon on the very top right hand side. So you see it says active, then there's a question mark, and then there's a gear icon, top right hand side.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, I can't sorry?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  I'm sure. Where am I? Do you know the hiver icon that you can see the main icon? I don't know.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Ah, wait a minute. Should I be in my inbox?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  In your inbox, Paul?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  See all settings… and, okay, perfect. Let's click on, create new filter.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Oh, you want a new filter?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yes, let this filter be as it is. We'll try creating another fresh one. Maybe this filter was created earlier for the earlier inbox, and that's why it's not getting recognized because we changed the settings in the shared inbox. So, let's try creating a fresh Gmail filter. Yeah, filters and blocked address. Awesome. Sorry, no worries. No worries. You're good. And in the to field, let's add the shared inbox address. Once again.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  There's a comma there, actually.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay, awesome. And let's click on create filter… the email address, the spelling, everything looks good. Right?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yes.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. Let's click on the first option, skip the inbox.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  It's not checked. No, it's not, you're not clicked on it. Try clicking on it.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  It is sorry, it is the first one, skip inbox. Oh, archive.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yes, try clicking on it. It is clicked. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Now, I see it's got clicked and you should see an option that says, never mark it as important.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, the.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  third one from the bottom?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yes, yes. Got that.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. And also, click on the last option. It says, also apply filter to matching conversation. Just give me a second before clicking on create filter. I don't see it's. Got applied. Yes.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  It is applied. Yeah. Can you see it now?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Not really. Okay. Now, it's got applied. Perfect. Let's click on create filter. Yep.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  That's done. Yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  All right. Click on create filter.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  It's done. I have created it's in there.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Let me try sending a test email.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Somehow, Gmail is not applying. Gmail, is applying your inbox label and all the problems are coming, but we'll mostly… we shot this.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yes, sir.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Bye.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Mistakenly, yeah. Did you receive my test email by the way?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Let me just double check.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  I guess I had a network drop. So, I'm not sure if that email, if it's true, then I can send another one. Just give me a second. Okay?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  All right. I just sent another test email. Let's give it a few more seconds. It'll soon come in.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  All right. It looks as if that worked.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Hey, Paul, let's see if you have received it. Click on the inbox. Yeah.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  There's nothing in the inbox. Yeah, but in bookings, it's there.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Awesome. Perfect. I guess the previous filter was not recognizing… the settings because maybe we changed the share inbox and that's why it was not recognizing it, but no worries. Now, it would recognize it and it will not apply the important label to it.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Okay. Awesome. That's great.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Paul, you have been wonderful today. Can I help you with anything else?

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  No, I think that's it. I, as far as I understand now that basically anything going to bookings. Com will automatically be transferred into the booking shared folder, correct? The same for VIP support? Yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Correct.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah. Then I think that's fantastic. Thank you so much.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  You're most welcome, Paul. All right. I'm going to now go ahead and let even Rakesh know about that. The issue has got resolved. And if you need anything else, we are always a message away, Paul.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Yeah, I will. Thank you very much. Again. Have a great weekend. Yeah.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Wish you the same. Paul. Bye bye.

Paul Felton (paul.felton@takethatphoto.co.uk):
  Bye bye.
