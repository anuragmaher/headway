Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, then,

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  from further ahead, we don't require every time to get the permission from there.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):

Once this is approved, then we should be able to set up hiver with your shared email inbox, then you can invite a couple of your test users, and for them also, I mean, because they're going to be whitelisting, so they will also be able to install hiver like get into hiver account for testing, and then it will be easy for us to set it up. Yes. Okay.

  Yeah. Krunal, I have another meeting at four 30 with another client, but I have a hard stop at 420. So let's see, let's wait for maybe five, 10 more minutes. Otherwise we might want to reschedule it because this needs to be done at your end.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And once that is cleared, I think it's going to be simply straightforward process. Either, you can do that once it?

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
