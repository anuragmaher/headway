Nafentoulides (nicholas.afentoulides@digi.com):
  hey, Matthew. How you doing?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, good. How about you?

Nafentoulides (nicholas.afentoulides@digi.com):
  Oh, pretty good. I can't complain. How was the new year? It?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Was good. It was good yourself? Well.

Nafentoulides (nicholas.afentoulides@digi.com):
  It came one way or the other. Everyone's a little bit under the weather in the house, but, you know what?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Can we do? Yeah?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Actually, I have a colleague who's joining this call today as well, and he shot me a message that he's not feeling too well today either. So, I guess, you know, people were just out and about enjoying the holidays. Oh, yeah. I saw this thing on social media. I forgot how they phrased it, but just basically saying that today's… like today's one of the roughest Mondays of the year.

Nafentoulides (nicholas.afentoulides@digi.com):
  I believe it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Looks like Jerry here is joining as well.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Hey, Matthew. Sorry, I'm late. I was having a problem getting zoom loading.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No problem. You know, with today being one of the first days back after the holiday, I think everyone deserves a little grace today.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Appreciate it awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And I also have one person joining from my end too. Let me see if he's joining here yet. He might be a little late that's fine. But great. We could actually just get started without him. So I'll set the agenda for the call today. My name is matt senior account executive here at hiver agenda for the call. Wanted to just spend the first couple minutes or so. Getting an understanding of kind of the motivations for this. I know you sent me that email, Jerry with a lot of information. So I already have most of it, but, you know, always good to just chat about it real quick here. And then from there, I can walk through the product as well. Tell you a little bit about hiver and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  It does. Do you mind if I record this, matt?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, not at all. Go for it. Okay?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, Jerry, if you don't mind sharing here, Jerry, did you happen to… I know you weren't at the other call, but we did send a recording of it too. Did you have a chance to watch the other recording at all? Or?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  I did. Yeah, I watched the other recording. I also have a demo account. So I was tinkering with it. I don't know if it's demo trial account? I guess it is. Yeah. Okay. Under digi. So, yeah, I've had a chance to kind of mess around with it a little bit probably spent. I don't know, say about four hours, give or take? Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. Well, then, yeah, since you've seen the other one, I'll skip a little bit of background about the company, right? So you heard about that as well. So you're in the trial fantastic. So, yeah, tell us, and I got minaj on the line as well. He's a solutions engineer here at hiver too, so he can help with any of the more technical questions that come up. But, yeah, tell me some of the things I guess Jerry what specifically you wanted to go over on this call? And what your thoughts were based on, what you've seen so far with hiver?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Sure. So at digi, we have a few tech support teams. I know that you kind of learned a bit about that on the previous call that I wasn't able to attend.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  But my team represents one of the teams at digi as well. So my team is the ventus team. We effectively… provide sort of a network as a… service to our customers. We also are beginning to work with channel partners in sort of a shift in our business model. So we'll kind of have this traditional tech support where we offer network level tech support to direct customers. And we'll have this sort of other part of our team that handles support. Think of like a sort of like a level two support and higher for channel partners who will be offering their own support to their own customers. So we're you know, providing routers, we're providing solutions for those routers, and either we are providing direct support to direct customers or we are providing support more advanced support for channel partners who are then… the first line of support for their customers. My setup is a contact center setup. We use nice and contact today via… RingCentral, and we receive phone calls. We do make some phone calls. Some of our phone calls are to like isps carriers, vendors, things like that. And that's all in an effort to help support what we're providing. So, you know, whether it's verizon at T or whether it's a channel partner that we need to follow up with. We do make up on calls as well. We do not have chat support today. We've just never used it. Most of our customers either email us for support, call us for support or they will open a ticket via a web portal we have that we call Genesis… and that's a homegrown tool. It's got a rest API that we use and our customers use as well. And that's kind of the general layout. And I think what makes us different from the other teams here is we're not using Salesforce or Netsuite at all for sort of a CRM. Eventually, I think everyone will be on Netsuite at digi including those who are using Salesforce today, but that's probably years down the road. So for now, our CRM is in a platform called odoo, it's been customized over many years. And then Genesys that portal I mentioned is where our customers are opening tickets, running diagnostics, et cetera. Another thing that makes us stand out, feel free to jump in at any point if you have questions. But another thing that makes us stand out that's a bit. Of a challenge for us is we don't have a customer facing knowledge base. So there is no knowledge base today that our customers go to. If they have a quick question, if they have questions, they have to email us, call us or open a ticket… using docspot. Today. We're really just using it as an internal bot for our team to reduce escalations internally. So instead of having to talk to say a lead or someone in a senior role to answer questions, they might check that bot first to get answers to questions as opposed to having a customer facing AI chatbot. And so all of this is new to us including how we supply the information. We're having to build the information as we go for AI, but we haven't had the luxury of a massive knowledge base the way digi has one today.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. This makes sense. And how many people are on your team?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  25 people in total. Okay, 25 people.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, yeah, I think some of the things that you mentioned hiver can do very well. Obviously, there's some things right now that hiver can't support. One of them being phone, right? I'm not sure if you've noticed that at this time, hiver doesn't have any phone systems connected to it. Sure… right? So that was something that, you know, obviously with the other conversations we had with the other people, the digi team hasn't come up yet. So yeah, that's one limitation… potentially down the road. It could be coming. So we have a different product. We have a Gmail product that does have a phone integration. It's through a third party system called Aircall. So it is, you know, something that we do have on another product, but does the system need to have a phone system for you to work? Or are you okay using it with a different phone system separately?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Yeah. I guess my, I know eventually we need to move into, you know, using our phone system as well using some voice AI… as well to help support those level one interactions. You know, obviously, ideally, we'd like to do that sooner rather than later, but I already understand that this isn't something hiver can do. We understand that. I guess my bigger question surrounds integration into our systems integration into something like our contact center. You know, if customers are emailing us today directly, that doesn't happen like it does in the other units, the other units, they either have like a landing page sort of a walled garden. Everything gets managed through Netsuite before it arrives at the agent for us. It's the contact center's email servers for outgoing email, you know, and it's our email servers for incoming. So, I'm wondering how, if, at all? I mean, is this effectively a replacement to that email channel in our contact center? If we use hiver or is there something I'm not thinking of here?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I believe so. No, I believe so, minaj, can you hear me?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I can hear you. Hi guys.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Hi, minaj.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Minaj. Would you be able to follow up on that statement that Jerry made there?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  So, I guess minaj, have you guys worked with nice and contact like CX one? Any of these, anyone with a nice CX one contact center?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Not really, Jerry. Okay.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Have you worked with anyone with any kind of contact center application or they generally come into you and it's sort of the first time they're going to be integrating something like this?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No, see… contact center integration. You know, what exactly is the purpose? Like it's just for your contact directory to upload? Like.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Yeah. So let's say we want to leverage chat, which would be new for us. We don't have chat today, okay? But we also want our contact center email to be leveraged as well. So, I know you said you're not using nice CX one or you haven't used nice CX one in any capacity like you haven't worked with anything like that. Have you worked with any other contact center vendor applications to… integrate email AI support?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I can find out. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  We can actually check the integration Jerry, but I know for a fact like for now we haven't integrated with anything specific. Okay, most of our integration anyways… right? How we do it is like let's say if this is something very important to you and which is going to, you know, help your workflow a bit, you know, a lot better. We call in our product guys, we set up a call, we see what are the possibilities. And we also see if there are any workarounds with the current setup that we have. And then, yeah, take things forward, but let's say, so let's take our chat itself as an example, right? Sure. Yep. So in our chat, you will be able to get a, you know, use a contact form and… also use an offline form. In the contact form, you collect the necessary details from the person who's starting the chat, and in the offline form, they can simply send an email to the actual chat mailbox email address.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  If that makes sense? It?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Does, yeah, okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  mentioned earlier that we sort of have two different types of support models we'll be looking at in the future, one involving channel partners and one involving direct customers. And because of the kind of work we do every customer is a little bit different, you know, some customers have different requirements, different routers, different things that we support. How does that work… for anyone you work with today? Where there's almost, you almost need a different bot for different types of customers. How does… that work today with any of your existing customers? How easy would it be for us to separate? You know, the way a bot answers questions based on the customer or based on a customer type, let's say.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Oh, so if you're talking about the chat mailbox, then we have several things called like custom fields, custom views, tags, and everything. So we use these features as in a combination of… to categorize… your emails and… then map it accordingly.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  We have, sorry.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Guys a little bit that's okay. So we use automations to make sure these incoming emails are, you know, based on the subject line or based on the body or based on the email addresses is put into specific folders assigned to the right team members and also have separate views for each of these categories. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And, and Jerry, and also to add to that, right? So there are different workflows that you can set up per specific customers specific domains that can trigger different automations as well. And then, the, as far as like the AI goes, the AI can reference different knowledge sources as well and can get categorized also. And then, yeah, there, there's also the ability to adjust the AI as well. So, so, yeah, it's built to, you know, have different scenarios, for different customers.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Let's say a user logs into the portal Genesis that's our portal. When that user is logged in, we know that user, is, you know, for is a specific is under a specific customer, for instance… is hiver able to leverage an API to sort of identify customers in that sort of way where, you know, using an API, let's say our Genesis API, that workflow could be set up to say, okay, I'm… making an API call. This, this customer is, you know, acme inc, therefore initiate this workflow. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That's definitely something that, we could scope out for you. It's not, it's not something that's you know, we have native integrations with tools, that could do that right now, but for something like, you know, a different solution that we don't have like Genesis, we would just need to scope that out, and then, yeah, see if it's possible, to build. But yeah, that's definitely something, that we could look into if that was a requirement for you. And I know for, if you'd listened to the last call, the last digi call that we had. We had our CTO on the call too. So he's you know, he's made this a priority too. So yeah, we're happy to scope that out if that's something that you would need to have set up?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Okay. Thanks… Nick. Did… you have any questions? I think that kind of between, the last demo and sort of the answer to these questions? I think I have what I need.

Nafentoulides (nicholas.afentoulides@digi.com):
  No, I think you asked everything that was on my mind Jerry. Okay?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  All right. Great. Yeah, I think we're good on our side. I know there's another meeting coming up next week with everybody. So I'll be at that meeting.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. And yeah, yeah. So let me, and then, yeah, before that meeting too, I'll just follow up with my team on some of these, you know, integrations that you're interested in to get their feedback as well. And then based on that, we could also, we… can… either talk about it on that larger call that we have next week or if I have something before then I'll just shoot you an email as well.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  All right. Sounds good. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But basically, in summary, anything that we don't have today, especially when it comes to integrations, our team is definitely open to scoping it out. We build custom integrations, you know, quite frequently for our larger customers. So that's this is definitely a possibility as well. So I'll put this in front of them as well and get you an answer.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Okay.

Nafentoulides (nicholas.afentoulides@digi.com):
  Out of curiosity, how long do integrations typically take? I know obviously some custom stuff, you know, might have a firm timeline per SE, but, you know, how long do these typically take?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's hard to say honestly… it's different, quite different frequently. I think it just depends on how, you know, in depth the integration needs to be and how accessible it is as well. I don't really have a time. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Guys. So just an additional question. So this integration we are talking about with the other contact center, do they have like open API integration?

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  So we're actually talking about an integration with Genesys at the moment. Yeah. And that would be a rest API and I can share the documentation with you. You know, my thinking is that at minimum, you know, if we moved forward with hiver as a company, at… minimum, my team could use the chat, right? Because we don't have customer facing chat today. It's something that we want. And yeah, if that's the case, then we would drop that chat widget inside that portal. But that portal is, you know, it requires people to log in as their customer user, and that gives us a level of control that I think is important, right? Because we can say, you know, don't answer questions about this. If you're talking to this customer or if you're talking to this customer, this is the product line that they use that's kind of the level of control we would probably need. Otherwise, we would have… whenever we go to use the AI, it would probably hallucinate pretty heavily. So that's kind of where my mind is and that's where my line of questioning was going.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So rest apis are good. Like if the Genesys has like rest API, then hiver can work with it. But yeah, going forward, like we need to understand in a much deeper sense like what's going to work, what all objects or data that you need to pull from Genesys and how hiver has to show it. So, yeah… sure. We can check with the product team. We can check with Aditya and like, you know, bring him on the next call to just talk about integrations and see what can be done.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Do you have, I don't know like a spreadsheet, a workbook or something that you generally provide to customers so that you can go through the discovery process particularly with regard to custom integrations, and maybe we can just fill something out for you to make life a little easier.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Matt, can you check?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'll check on that. I'll probably just, we'll probably just have some questions my team will have and I can just email over the questions to you. And then, yeah, if you can provide those questions for our team, that would help a ton. So that's what we'll do.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Okay. That'll work.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, yeah, we'll talk to our product team. I'll get those questions for them. They are going to have a lot of questions on this and I'll just shoot them over to you and then, yeah, we'll go from there.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  That sounds so great. Thanks for your time, everyone. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I appreciate you both joining here and thanks for letting me know about this ahead of time before the call next week. That helps a ton. So, yeah, hopefully I'll get some answers for you quite soon here. And yeah, I'll shoot them over to you. Thanks so much.

Jerry Cuevas Jr. (jerry.cuevas@digi.com):
  Thanks. Have a good day, everyone, you too. Bye.
