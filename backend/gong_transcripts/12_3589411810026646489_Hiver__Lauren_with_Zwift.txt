Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Lauren. How are you doing?

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm good. How's it going? I've noticed that you checked out, the,

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  what I'm sorry, I missed that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm sorry, I got an alert that you wanted to speak about the AI add on for hiver?

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Yeah. So, I am using AI for, I had used up our 20 automations. So I switched some of the automations to using the AI tagging to free up some spots that seems to be working well, but then I just saw the other day when I booked this was that it said the AI trial was ending. So I didn't know any info. I thought it was just included. So I just wanted to get some information about that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah, for sure. And I remember mentioning it a couple of times in the past, but anyways, the entire AI feature suite that we have, right? The co pilot, the tagging, all of it that's effectively part of a 20 dollar per user per month add on separate of any subscription tier that you want, right? So that the message you saw today is, you know, the ending of that because we've had it on beta for close to about four or five months now, during which time we've been using it just like for other customers, right? So that's effectively the alert that you saw in the pricing for the add on as a whole?

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Got it. Yeah, I'm not using all of the AI features, only the tagging, like we don't use the co pilot and I think there was one other I'm trying to get in there. Oh, the sentiment analysis. So, is it separate like per piece? Or it's a total package for the whole AI tool?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I mean, the way we've got it configured is that the whole thing is a package and it has to be purchased as the whole suite. But if you're ready to move ahead, I can, I mean, we're working on a bit of a discount on that considering thanksgiving and everything coming up at the end of the month. If you're ready to move ahead, I can understand what that pricing on the discount looks like. Just give me one quick minute. Let me pull that up. Yeah, we're working on a 30 percent discount on the top. So it's going to put the AI add on at 14 usd per person per month.

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Okay. And that's an annual plan, right? If I remember, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That will just be added to your renewal and it will be part of the overall subscription as a whole.

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Okay. And then just so I can compare because automations also work for it. And I know that I mentioned I'm at 20 already. What about adding more automations? Is that a separate option as well?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no. Unfortunately, the automations and anything requiring features from like the next plan requires a full plan upgrade.

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Okay. And what is the next plan?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. Sure. So the next plan is the elite that's the highest plan that we have on hiver and that lists at 75 per month on the annual route.

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Okay. And how many automations does that get us?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's unlimited, no more gaps. Okay? So that's unlimited automations. You get skill based routing as an option within the automation. It unlocks a couple of other advanced features as well.

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Okay. We have budgeting coming up. So I was like definitely trying to get the info now. So if, yeah, if I want to recommend the elite plan, then I can get that on our team's budget.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure thing. You know, Lauren, let me do one thing, right? I know your renewal is on the thirteenth of December, but let me do one thing. Let me just have a chat internally and I want to send you a discounted elite AI bundle together. Okay? If you think it would be realistic for us to aim for like a confirmation by the end of the month, that would help me look at the actual discounts and put that in.

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah… your question to me was whether I would could have an answer by the end of the month?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Would you be able to confirm and have, the auto form or like just a confirmation done by before thanksgiving basically, so we can, you know, have your renewal moved ahead by a few days, have the credits adjusted and have your account switched?

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Let's see by thanksgiving, so that's less than two weeks. I can… definitely shoot for it. I'm just then reliant on passing it through my finance team, but I mean, it would definitely be before our renewal.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. All right. Cool. Yeah. So the only reason why I asked is the discount if I'm able to unlock anything for the elite plan would be tied to confirmation processing before thanksgiving. Yeah. So let me do one thing. Let me send you the AI discounted price and, you know, if that works, we can have that enabled in the end of November and we can have that included in your renewal when December comes basically. So it'll be a prorated charge for like 10 days by the end of November. And then at renewal, you'll have the elite pricing as well. You let me know if you want to include elite and we can have that included as well before. Okay?

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  So, if we go to, elite will still be separate from or the AI would still be separate from that, it's not included in the elite.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Irrespective of which plan you're on, it will be separate.

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Okay. And then when you send over the pricing for elite, could you just give like a few bullets of like what the benefits of switching to elite would be?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Totally.

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Perfect.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. All right. Brilliant. So what I'll do is I'll send you two different auto forms, one for just the AI, add on pending confirmation before thanksgiving, and one for the elite package pending confirmation before renewal. And, you know, if you're good to go ahead before thanksgiving for both, let me know and we can combine the two and get that done. If not, we can do one at a time and go from there.

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Okay. Sounds great.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Brilliant. Anything else Lauren?

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  That's it. Thanks so much all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Thank you so much.

Lauren Rodriguez (lauren.rodriguez@zwift.com):
  Okay. Bye bye bye.
