Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's up, Tom?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Not much. How are you Cole?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I appreciate you hopping on the call. Where are you based Adam?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Syracuse New York? How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, nice. I'm based out of Brooklyn, New York. Oh, okay. But I appreciate you hopping on the call here today, Tom. So just to set a quick agenda, would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role? What got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions at next steps.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  That sounds fine. So.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  I'm one of the founders of the company. My responsibility is sales and marketing. What we have three people here that work on sales and marketing, and we have a couple of distribution, well, Google groups, basically, right? I'm sure you're familiar with that. We have two or three Google groups that we collaborate on for inbound emails. They're customer inquiries usually… and we're constantly playing the game of, okay, who has this one? Has it been moved forward? Where is it at? That kind of stuff? We have a CRM tool called Pipedrive, but these things are generally sort of pre Pipedrive, right? They're not qualified. So they are things that don't deserve to be in Pipedrive yet. Maybe some will elevate to that, but most do not. And it's really, I was hoping that maybe this would be something that would kind of keep it, keep us all on the same page… and understand who has the ball on each inquiry… making sure that every inquiry gets run to ground and completed, and close out the ones that are done and nobody needs to worry about anymore. And then also increase the ability for each of us to see how each one is being moved forward. So that's kind of the goal. I don't think we have a lot of interest in some of the advanced features of hiver. So I'd rather not spend time on that kind of stuff. Just really, I think it's just the basics of the shared inbox that is appealing. I also have Judy mastrocco here too, and she's one of the three… okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So primarily just looking to better manage a couple different Google groups where you have intake of communications coming in and ensuring that there's like your delegation and visibility into who's owning what, where things are in status and that, you know, things don't slip between the cracks and try to run them through to a potential opportunity or, you know, or just unqualify it essentially?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  That's exactly it. Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. I.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Have I have signed up for your demo? So I have it attached to my Gmail. I do like that, you know, we live in Gmail. So, so that is one of the things that's also appealing about it is that it's a Chrome extension and it just, you know, it's basically sitting right there, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent. And then in terms of the amount of Google groups, Tom, is it just two of them that your team is managing?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Those are the main ones for this group. There is another one that is for a wider audience for when purchase orders come in. And occasionally there's messages in there that would be beneficial to manage in a shared inbox as well. So, if those, although I don't want that entire Google group to go to the shared inbox, I think if there was a particular message that came in on, that we could individually pick off and move to the shared inbox, it looks like that's a capability that is something that we could do. But yes, there's primarily just the two.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So let me hop into a product demonstration here and give you a rundown of hiver. And then we can just go from there. But taking a look at my screen here, you know, what's nice about hiver is we are in that Google workspace. Like you said, right? We are a certified Google partner. So you'll have your personal inbox up top, and then the shared inboxes or Google groups below. So we have as you can see customer success, share mailbox, finance, healthcare, info, operations support. Let's take a look at this finance inbox for this example, can?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  You do each one of these have to be one to one with a Google group, or can there be more than one Google group feeding into a shared inbox? So?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You can have like a one to one Google group feeding into the mailbox, and then you can have also have the aliases. So if you have additional aliases that you want to funnel in, that's something we can do as well?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. What if, so we've got the two Google groups, right? Do those two Google groups need to go to, they need to go to separate shared… inboxes then? Is what you're saying? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We would want to keep those separate, okay? Because there's two different purposes. There could be different tags associated with them, different custom fields. You want to treat them as like their own entities… but clicking into the finance, right? So once you click into the mailbox, it opens up sub views beneath it, that helps us manage the intake. So the first is on assigned section, new emails that have hit the mailbox or group that need to be distributed. The next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me and then the team view. So from a manager perspective, you can see within this Google group, what is everyone working? What's outstanding, and what needs to be completed. So as you can see, I have 10 conversations assigned to my name. These are all the conversations that have the status open that I'm currently working through… want to pause right here? Any questions on this?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  No, I think I've got that. I've seen how you can assign it. I'd like to, I played around a little bit with the status. So, okay, here's, a question. How does the stuff that you're showing me here, right? How does that change what happens in my inbox? My regular inbox?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So this is just your personal inbox right here. If you're assigned conversations from the shared mailboxes, they can show up here, but totally depends on what you want to do, right? It can either be filtered out. So you just keep this clean from a personal perspective, okay?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  But if.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  you want to be in the loop and see those conversations that you're associated with from the shared mailbox, in your personal inbox, we can do that as well. Or if you want to keep it separate, like then you can just kind of treat this as the shared mailbox management down here.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. So I think what you're saying is that, so like one of our Google groups is called sales, right? Sales at criticallink. Com. So those come to all of our inboxes today, right? Right? And if we create a shared inbox that's connected to sales, right in hiver, they will show up in the shared inbox for sure. Yep. And then I think you're saying that they can stay in my personal inbox as well if I want or I can filter them out of my personal inbox and just manage them in the shared inbox. Do I have that right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. That's correct.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. And each user can do that separately however they like to see it yep.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So totally up to you how you want to create that view.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. And then how do I filter it out of my personal inbox? How would that happen? So?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It's with the specific Gmail filters that we have that's something our technical support team can assist you with that's not something I typically do for the clients. Okay? All right. But going into the unassigned, right? So I'll click in this email. And on the right hand side, that hiver tab is going to open up that's going to help us manage the intake of communications. Yep. So, the first thing you know, we can do is assign it. In this case, I'll assign it to myself and the team. Now, I'm going to follow up and own this conversation. We can also assign via round Robin automation to equally distribute them. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So identifying keywords in the subject line, keywords of the body of text, and then distributing work based on those automations that we set. Yeah.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  No need the.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Status tracking. So open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks. We're working through these to a resolution tags for organizing conversations similar to shared labels. But we can also report on these on the back end. If that's something you'd be interested in to understand why people are reaching out on the topics that we're getting. I.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Noticed when you changed the status from open to pending… it disappeared from my inbox. Why did that happen? So?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  When you change it to pending, it'll go to the pending view. So that's essentially when we're waiting for a response from the client. So you can click pending right here. Yeah. So it shows five in pending right now, right? So that's why, because it's throwing it in the pending view away from the mind. Okay?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  What happens if the customer doesn't respond? Okay? If.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  the customer doesn't respond, you can either create like a rule based automation to automatically close the conversation after a certain period of time?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. Or bring it back yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Or you can just bring it back and close it. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we have these custom fields to further track maybe what the conversation's about, collect additional data and then the collaboration aspect. So being able to collaborate internally with folks on conversations where it will live historically on the thread. So.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  You just tagged matt. How does matt see that happening? The fact that you tagged him? Does he get a notification somewhere? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, right up top, you'll see this notification bell icon. You'll click on this and you'll see an app mention. Let me see if I can find one here that I'm in. Yeah, see like right here, like matt mentioned me to know at Cole. Okay? And then I can click on this and it'll take me right to the thread.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. So, let's say that.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  That you responded to this, you replied to the customer on this inquiry, right? And you did not copy the group, right? On your reply. Yep, you know what I mean? Yep, you just replied directly to the person who sent it. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, that won't matter because once it hits the share mailbox, it'll live in here in perpetuity unless removed. Okay? So, yeah.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Will all the team members be able to see all the interaction on that thread? Is my question that's.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  correct. They?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Will. Okay. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's part of our, you know, our value prop. We're giving your team the ability to understand where everything is in status, if someone needs to pick up or someone left off. Everyone has visibility into all conversations that come to the mailbox, got.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  It. Okay. That's one of the things that I think is good. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we do have things I know you mentioned like you're not that interested, but we do have like an AI co pilot for like streamlining responses and like things of that nature.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  But we're in? I mean, we're in Google workspace. So we've got the AI, same thing. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then in terms of analytics, so, not sure if you'd be looking for any sort of analytics, Tom, is that something that you'd be looking to glean further from the Google groups? Not?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Really? No. Okay. So I can.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Just give you some high level ones from like a base package we have like, you know, workload.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So understanding like active new resolved conversations over a time period. Sure. What our average first response time was as a group… our average resolution time per user metrics. So understanding emails assigned per user sent out per user, and then individual performance metrics below from a first response resolution time. Okay? And then just the tags, this is definitely one of the more helpful ones. Just kind of understanding why are people reaching out to those Google groups? What are the hot topics we're seeing and trends? Okay. But that's pretty much the main things I wanted to cover today though? Tom, and one, one other thing to note as well as you continue to test, you do have access to our technical support team 24 seven, three six five. So you can click on the higher settings button and then click instant chat support 24 seven. So, if you have any technical questions, set up questions as you continue to test with the team, Tom, you can engage them by clicking this button.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. And they'll.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  also hop in a call with you to troubleshoot any questions you might have. Okay? And that's also something that you'll have throughout the service, you know, if you do sign up… but just want to pause right here. Like what are your thoughts on this so far? And what kind of makes sense? Like a typical next step for us would be like offering a call to see how the trial is going and answer any further questions you might have. So what are your thoughts on setting that up for like a potential next step?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Yeah. I mean, I think that.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  For the most part, that's seems to do what I was hoping to accomplish. So… yeah, we could set something up for maybe next week. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And how would I can do same time? I can also do Friday too if that works for you?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Well, let's let me ask a couple questions first. There on the website, it says that there's integration with Pipedrive, Can you, can you demo that or no? I?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Don't have that, in… my demo environment, but you can set that up in the trial as well. That's something set up and test yourself if you want to, you know, take a look at it.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  How do you do that? So?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's something, our tactical support team can hop on a call with you after this to help you set that up. Okay?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  The, there's different pricing tiers, tell me about those. Yeah. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  In terms of the pricing tiers, I'd recommend the growth package for what you're looking to do like you're just looking for a baseline package to help with a shared inbox management. So, I'm 25 dollars per user per month. We sell in buckets of five. So like five, 10, 15, 20. So the five buckets should suffice based on your user count of three. Yeah. So if you go for an annual commitment, it would be.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I think it's 170. Let's see it'd be 1,500 dollars on an annual basis for an annual commitment. And that's annual upfront. And then if you go monthly, it'll be 175 dollars a month.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. So two months free basically?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Like basically, it's a 20 percent savings.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. 15, 1,500 dollars, you said, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, 1,500 dollars for an annual commitment, and then 175 dollars per user per month if you go month to month.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. And then, how does that? I mean, if we started with free, can we start with free? And then, you know, sort of like extend, our trial period there, and then move up at… a later point, so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You would only have access to one mailbox, you wouldn't be able to, it just wouldn't work for the tags and the amount of mailboxes you would need.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Okay. So, you wouldn't all right. So we wouldn't be able to do, go ahead. No. I was.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Going to say, I just wouldn't recommend free. It's like super basic. And I just don't think and you wouldn't have the pipe drive integration as well. The.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Pipe drive integration goes away. Okay?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  But yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  When would work for you to touch base? I'm also happy to extend the trial out a little bit as well just to give you more time to evaluate. So I could extend it out to let's say another five days to the eighteenth of this month to give, you know, some additional time.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  We could check in again in a week,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Let's see. I can do same exact time.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  That doesn't work for me next week, but next.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  week, no.

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  I'm at 11 o'clock works, I can do.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  11 o'clock as well. And you're yeah, you're est, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, 11 o'clock works for me, same time next week.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay? All right, perfect. So, I'll, I can follow up with some more information as well as some setup guides to kind of continue to help you and the team work through it. But I appreciate the time today, and I will follow up with you shortly,

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  One more question for you. The, I… noticed that if I'm in my regular inbox, right? And I see an email and I click on it, it's not part of the Google group, right? There is an option to add it to my shared inbox, yep 100.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Percent. So you have the ability to, if there's like a case where someone reaches out to you individually, but you're like, hey, I want to bring this in for collaborative purposes. Yep, you can push it to the mailbox and it'll add that tracking mechanism where you can track the status tags and all that stuff. Okay?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Do I lose that with free?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No. Okay. But yeah, I appreciate the time today, Tom. I'll talk with you soon and I'll follow up with some additional info, okay?

Tom Catalino (catalino@criticallink.com):
  Thank you. All right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Take care. All right, bye.
