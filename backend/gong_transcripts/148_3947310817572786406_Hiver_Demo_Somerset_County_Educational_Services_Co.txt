================================================================================

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on guys?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Good. How are you, hi?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good, good. Where are y'all calling out at today?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We're in bridgewater New Jersey?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, nice. Very cool.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I'm Kristen self, this is Philomena muller, and this is Sharon petty. Okay, perfect. Good afternoon. Our tech Guy said he's going to connect. He's rich Haywood, he's going to connect by phone.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Perfect.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We didn't get started without him because he thought the meeting was at.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You know, I appreciate you guys hopping in the call here today. So just to set a quick agenda, we'd love to do a quick round of introductions, you know, understand your role, what got you interested in hiver?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And I can introduce myself first. So, my name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the email management, customer experience space for a little over six years now, and yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can potentially help y'all today.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I'm Kristen self, the executive secretary of the business administrator. We're interested in this product because of our special education transportation department. And that's why we're involved. Hi, I'm Phil miller, I'm transportation director and interest because of the special Ed and how large it's grown. Sharon petty, I'm accounts receivable previously special Ed, which is why I'm involved.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. And just to understand further team, you know, what kind of brought your interest to take the meeting with hiver, what you're looking to solve for… are y'all like managing shared inboxes today, shared emails, like what kind of like prompted the interest to learn more about the solution?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I'm the one who went to your website and found the document where you compare helpscout to hiver. Helpscout is the product that we use. Now, we keep adding more and more users to it. And our special education transportation department went from 6,000,000 dollars when we took it over in 2014 to now we're looking at 40 over 41,000,000 dollars this year. So we're looking to streamline. And first, Sharon and I have a programming background and for the workflows and the tags, we're trying to streamline it. But we're very limited what we could do in helpscout because we have a legacy plan. We're interested in seeing what your product can do, and if it can solve some of the issues that we're dealing with right now and just be more efficient.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. And just to understand how you're using helpscout today, are you primarily using it just to manage email communications? Yes. Okay. Awesome. And what are the emails? Is it primarily one email address that you're managing or is there a couple of different ones that's funneling into helpscout?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  One one, but we might be open to doing different ones.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Different email addresses. If we were setting up like the other esc, they have a quotes. In other words, we'd like to see the two options that's all. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. So I can hop into a demonstration here, you know, give you a rundown of hiver, how we differentiate from helpscout. And then, you know, feel free to stop me and ask any questions as we're going through it, definitely want it to be a collaborative experience. But taking a look at my screen here, what's nice about hiver team? And the first differentiator off the bat is that we live within the Google workspace. And just to confirm, are you using Gmail today?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yes, yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. So we live within the Google workspace, and we're a certified Google partner. So you don't need to log into an external platform. We're bringing all those email management capabilities right within that already familiar environment that your team is already living in. So taking a look at the left hand side here, you'll see a couple of different shared mailboxes, right? This is the customer success mailbox, the finance teams, which could be like apar, HR, healthcare projects and support. So I'll click into the support share mailbox for this example. And when I do it's going to open some sub views beneath it that's going to help us manage the intake of those emails. So the first is the unassigned section, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be delegated out. The next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me that I need to work on and complete. And then there's the team view. So this will give you give us a breakdown of what everyone on the team is currently working on in real time. So I can see there's open email communications across all the assignees, and I can click on individual's name, see exactly what they're working on. Just want to pause right here. Any questions so far?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  No. So when you say team, you're just talking about the other members in the department or the company who are working through hiver.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's correct. So, whoever is associated with hiver and has a license and working through emails, those are the people that you will see on the left. Okay. But going to the mine, right? I've been assigned these two emails right here. I'll click into this. And when you're on an email, you have a couple of different options right there's a few ways we can assign the work. The first is clicking on it and assigning it to the member. In this case, you know, I have assigned it to myself. The next way we can assign work is through a round Robin automation. So as the emails come in, let's say there's 10 people on your team and 20 emails come in. Everyone will get equally distributed, two conversations amongst those 10. And then the last way is skill based routing. So identifying keywords in the subject line of the email, maybe keywords or phrases in the body of text or the email and routing it to the specific person who's able to handle that query and has the knowledge and skill set to do so.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  That's what I'm interested in seeing that type of assignment, a skill?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  What we would call workflow in helpscout.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. 100 percent. So those are our workflow automations that you can build and I can show you that in the back end shortly. And then we can also track like the statuses. So whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks and that we're working through these to a resolution, adding those tags for organizational purposes. So we can add tags manually, we can add tags using automations, and we also do have an AI tagging capability. Okay?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Question, how many tags can you create?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Unlimited.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Unlimited. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And you can use these tags to create folders. You can use these tags to provide analytics on the back end to understand why people are reaching out to the mailbox and so on and so forth. And then these custom fields. So we can create, you know, dropdown fields, date range, fields, text box fields and value fields to view data, take action on it, report on it and search on it. For instance, this is a email priority dropdown field that shows whether it's high medium, low priority, and you can organize based on these as well.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the last thing on the panel is the collaborative aspect, so you can collaborate internally with people. I'll send this notification to matt. He'll, receive that notification right up here in the bell icon. He'll, click on it. It'll take him to this thread where maybe he'll use our AI summarizer to get up to speed on the conversation really quickly. He can also see our AI sentiment analysis to understand if the client's like unhappy, happy, whatever it might be. Let's say we need more information, right? We can also draft replies using our AI copilot. So, this is one that I used in a previous demo just to streamline a response, and then you can insert it into the draft. So really easy to use data that you have to help your team provide responses with the information that we feed our copilot.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. But do you have saved responses saved templates that you can use as well?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Totally. So Gmail has, yeah, see these templates right here. So, you know, just populating information and inserting the template.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Perfect. That makes life a little bit easier. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But just want to pause right here, team. Like what are your thoughts on this so far?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Sounds good. So far? It sounds great. I mean, do.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  you like that it's native to Gmail versus like a standalone platform?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Whatever we do, if we change our product, it's going to be changed. We might be familiar in this room with Gmail. That department doesn't use it very often.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, it'll be night and day for them, but it's the bells and whistles, of course, that we're looking at the, being able to do the priority, being able to decide if we want to do it round Robin or work or what you call skill based. Yeah, limited tags, yes, for templates, right? I mean, this is, yes question. If say you're in on a sign and you open an email and somebody else opens the same email. Are you aware that somebody else opened the email that you're in?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. We have collision detection that'll show that people are looking at the email thread and it'll show their typing. So, if someone started typing it'll, show their name be like, hey, Cole miller has just started typing on this email.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. How does it show it? Can you give us a live example?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I can't because I would need someone to like be in this demo environment with me, but I can send you some, I can send you a.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Video, maybe that you could send us.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. Okay?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah. Rats, I thought of a question, oh, contacts. So, is Gmail just working with the Google contacts or is there a separate?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we have our own contacts like module essentially.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Like, you know, like it shows it all right here, right? All the different contacts, email information, stuff like that companies, so you can click into the individual companies as well.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, do you, so right now, what it looks like with helpscout creates the contacts every time an email is received. Do we have the ability to add our own contacts?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No. So this, it would be created when the conversations are received, we might be able to import historical. I need to check on that, but yeah, let me double check on that one with.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Helpscout. You've got contacts and company profiles. Okay? And we have multiples from the same email address multiples because they have a different tagline or something. I don't know how helpscout is doing in the background, but we work with districts who have multiple people, right? So, if somerset county esc, there might be four people with different emails that we contact or we deal with two H transportation company, and they have four different emails that we're dealing with there. And what we're finding is there's no way for the templates to work because we can't identify, we're putting company names and customer first name and last name, which isn't the way to do it. We need company profiles. So, could you show us the company profiles because we could probably use that for districts?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We can't create those company profiles.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  This is pretty much it. This is what it's going to show you who's associated the contacts and stuff like that.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, can we add contacts to that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We can't add?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Contacts?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I will need to confirm with my product team.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I believe we're similar in helpscout to that regard where we create contacts as they come inbound. Can we get rid?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Of duplicates, we used to be able to add contacts in helpscout. Not anymore. I couldn't add one. So I think that's how they're counting their contacts in other words, 5,400 contacts which we really don't have 5,400 contacts. So contacts interest us. And then are we limited to the amount of emails that we could send for outgoing mail?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, there's no limits from that perspective.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I want you to continue that question. Okay? So there was a law. I don't remember how long ago about spamming that you couldn't have more than a certain number of recipients for an email Gmail, I think is 99. Helpscout is 25. Do you have a limit on the number of recipients that an email can be sent to?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Do we have a.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I mean, it's to prevent spamming? We're not spamming, we're sending it to legitimate people. Yeah, we're sending email blasts to our contractors or districts, you know, for, to give them certain information, but we need to know whether you have a limit on the number of recipients that an email can be sent to.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that would be all through Google, right? Because we're just living in the workspace. So whatever Google can do today is what we'll be able to provide.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. So it matches Google.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But going to the support, like now, we're in the admin panel team. So here's where we can, you know, set up the channels, the engagement, the knowledge base automations, integrations, things of that nature. So this is the back end of it all. And going into the support shared mailbox, right? I'll show you how you can create those routing automations. So for instance, this is one where it's like, you know, new conversation comes inbound. We've identified that in the body of text and in the subject line of the email that the keywords urgent business critical and stopped working are present. We're going to add the tag urgent issue to automatically organize it and then assign it to Raghav because that's he deals with these types of requests.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And we can do different things, right? So we could have different actions like, you know, adding tags, sending customized replies based on queries, updating the status. So maybe you're getting emails that you necessarily don't need to do anything but you'll send over some information, we'll automatically update it to close. So there's no human intervention that has to happen. And then a bunch of these different actions right here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then in terms of some other things, we do have that ability for like the classic round Robin auto assignment to equally distribute the work as it comes in, we can measure client engagement. So if you want to measure customer satisfaction, that's something we can send out with customized feedback page.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah, we don't do that part.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then the slas… and then the slas too, right? So just like being able to understand how we're responding as a team. So let's say we have a first response goal of one hour and a resolution goal of 24 hours. If we're not able to hit these goals and it slips between the cracks, you can choose who you notify to escalate the conversation. So it's like a safety net to ensure that things aren't taking too long. And if they do go beyond those slas that you set as an organization, we're escalating it to the right people. So they know what's going on.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Can you send an email to like pop back up to the top of your queue… on a calendar or number of days or something like Google does that too? Gmail, does that we get three consecutive day emails from the contractor. And if we're telling them to notify us within three days, whether or not the student's been, in other words, can you put a timer on it and have it pop back up? Yes?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  The person who got the email knows that they need to contact the contractor again, if the contractors are applied to the email, this is what I'm interested in to see what you guys can do here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm trying to see if I have, so we can do that. We can create like due dates on conversations where it's like if a due date is met, automatically send a notification to prompt you to go back to that email communication. I just don't think I have that in there.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  And you can send email. You can, when an email is created, you can set it to send at a future date.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. You can have it sent at a future date or let's say like, you know, you've requested for information, we can create like an automation where you requested for information, there's been no response from the client within three days, let's automatically send a bump email being like, hey, we never received that information. Can you please assist with this?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. I know rich who's on the line? He's just muted. He mentioned sorting the emails. So in Google email, we have an app in the background that always puts the most current at the top. Oh, the most current response within the email within the email. So when they're coming in, if it's an email thread, will it always be the most current response at the top?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we can do that totally up to you if you want the newest at the top or oldest at the top. We have like the capability for both ways.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Woohoo. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I know. Rich.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Is listening rich, do you want any, do you have any questions? You can tell them whether you want it most recent at the top or the most current?

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  I guess from a technological perspective, how easy is integration?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you can start using it day one, it's where a Google Chrome extension takes about five minutes to download. So from that perspective really simple. And then from there, it's about just creating the tags, automations and things of that nature. And that will take usually like a week.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Got it. And then, is there any like MX stuff that you have to do in the background?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  In terms of migration? Yeah.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Yeah. In terms of like if, in order to use your service, like are you an intermediary or are you just seeing the stuff that's coming in direct through the regular Gmail MX and then doing whatever you're doing with the message?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we're just sitting on top of Gmail, right? So like we're not touching like doing anything with the body of text like that's. All just living in the actual Gmail servers itself. We're just layering on top.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Got it. So, this would be well, either of you if you can answer this question. So this would be everybody over in special Ed that would have the special Ed, trans at somerset county, esc email opened up in Gmail. And then this is an extension that sits on top of that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you would log in with your personal work email, and then we'd associate that shared mailbox into that account?

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Oh, okay. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, everyone would log in with their normal, you know, Richard at, you know, the company's domain and then you'll have access to all this.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Oh, they could all look at one email that everybody's sharing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Everyone will have the ability to see that shared mailbox on the left hand side. So, right now, I'm just logged into Cole, you know, at hiverhelpdesk. Com. But then I have these shared inboxes on the left that we were reviewing before. Okay?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, where it says inbox up at the top that's your Cole personal inbox. And then the one down at the bottom for us is the special Ed you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Know that's correct? Okay?

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Got it. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I know we are up at time here, team. We also do offer a free trial. So if this is something like that, you would want to test, we can also set that up what kind of makes the most sense from here in terms of your evaluation? Like when would you ideally be looking to move off of helpscout?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  For me, it would be ASAP. We still, we haven't involved anybody who's literally in that department yet. So we would probably have to look at the free. We'd probably have to look at the free trial, but of course, for us too, we have to approach our business administrator superintendent with cost.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right? So.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  What plans we've got right now, we've got between 10 users 10, about 10 users that are literally in this helpscout every day.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So for what you'd be looking to do, I'd recommend the pro plan. You know, that gives you the ability for, you know, 20 rule based automations for the mailbox. So you can make 20 automations, you get up to five shared mailboxes, you get the customized dashboards and reports, the ability to export the data as well as SLA analytics, which I think are pretty important. So it'd be if for an annual commitment, it would be 45 dollars per user per month, right? And then for a month, oh, sorry, go ahead.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  450 per month times, 10 months. Yeah, 5,400. Okay. 5,400. And then how is it? It's pretty simple to add additional users if we needed to or delete them?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So for the, you'll have a baseline of 10 users, you can add throughout the year, but you can't subtract once you've added. So until you get to your renewal, then you can kind of like go back to that baseline that you need, but you can add as you see, wish throughout the relationship, we can.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Add, but we can't delete so an existing user can't be renamed.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, they can, you can repurpose licenses. But if you want to add additional people, you just have to just add additional licenses in the admin panel.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And what's also? And what's also nice is team like for that for the amount of, you know, for 450 a month, you will get a dedicated customer success manager as well. So they'll actually like implement these rules with you. They'll set up the platform. It'll be a completely white glove experience and we can talk to you. Yeah, exactly like you'll actually have like a partner that's going to help you with all this. It'll take three.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Or four days to get back to us. Yeah, I've got to, I've got to go back to that. We're a school district and we deal with purchase orders. Are you guys okay with that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. 100 percent, we were, we can't.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  pay until we get the product and we start using it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. That's no, that's no problem. So we can work through that as we're kind of like going through these final details.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. Does rich have any other questions?

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Not, not at this time. It looks like everything as far as getting everything spun off would be pretty simple to do. So if we wanted to do that test, you know, we could sandbox that pretty good. Yeah, yeah. And,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  if you guys have time tomorrow too, we can use that as a kickoff call. If, if that works for you or we can look to next week.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I would probably look to next week just because we're under the gun for a couple of meetings and deadlines, but next week would work for us.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And, I can do, I can do Monday same time if that works for you?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We have, no, we have an interview later. So, yeah, Monday, same time? No, no, no, tomorrow. We'll have, no, I have a, I have an Elizabeth thing on Monday. Yeah. Okay. Which call should the 12 should be fine? All right. Yeah, 12 on Monday would work for us. I might have given you rich Haywood's the end of his email is wrong. There's letters that are transposed. It should be somerset county esc. Org. He didn't get the invitation. I had to forward it to him.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, let me see this.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  What's the date?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Can you, could you send me the email in the zoom chat? I?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Can send them the, I can send it to you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Perfect. So I just sent over the invite as well for November tenth at 12 PM. Esc, for a trial to call?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Perfect. And so, if we do a kickoff call, what's going to be different about the call on Monday than today?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, we're actually going to get you set up with the platform and we're going to walk you through it, get it in your Gmail environment, set up a shared mailbox with a free trial. Yeah, with a free trial.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  All right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then did you send over, that email in the zoom chat?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  How long is the free trial for?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You get it for a week?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  One week? Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, rich, or maybe Richard, could you type out your email in the zoom chat and I can add it to the invite.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Up there, he made it easier. I did it to rich Haywood?

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Yeah. I just put it. I just put it in there.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  All right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Yeah, I think for that call, if we can just make sure that, you know, the Chrome extension won't get blocked and that hiver's whitelisted. We should have no issues.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Did I have a question, oh, help docs, if somebody is new to this product and we're using it, do you have videos or help docs that we can access easily?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. We have a bunch of help documentation. I have training videos, I send my clients. And then on top of that, like you'll have access to a CSM. So, if you ever need to do one off trainings with them, they also provide that.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. How long have you guys been in business?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For seven years now? Seven years? Yeah, we have like over 2000 customers. Okay, perfect. I think we have a good game plan here. So I'll follow up with this call recording some additional information on what the setup looks like, so your team can review. And then, yeah, we're looking forward to kicking off the trial on Monday next week.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. Thank you so much.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Thank you guys so much. Thank you guys. Take care. It was great to meet you all.

Richard Heywood (rheywood@somersetcounytesc.org):
  Thanks.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Bye.
