Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Christian. This is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, Christian, can you hear me? I?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Can, can you hear me?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. How you doing?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  I'm doing well, man. How about yourself?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Doing well, doing well. I just turned on my camera. Let's see there we go there. It's working. Awesome, man. Well, I see you're actually in Los Angeles as well.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Yeah, I am. Yes, very.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Nice. Yeah, don't let my background confuse you. Yeah, it's like San Francisco. Yeah. No, I'm in the valley. I'm in the westlake village area.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Okay. Well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Appreciate you joining here. So, the agenda for the call today, just wanted to spend the first couple minutes, maybe learning a little bit more about you, your business, maybe anything that was top of mind that interested you in taking the call today? And then from there, I can tell you a little bit about hiver and walk you through the product and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good that?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Sounds amazing. Yeah, of course. Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, Christian, if you could start here, was there anything that maybe was top of mind on interested you in meeting with us?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  No, not really. I think that a few inbound requests came in. I was like, hey, you know, like it seems like a good product today. We're using, I think I mentioned we're using Zendesk is what we're using. I think we're evaluating intercom for Finn. So I thought it would be a great opportunity to just kind of chat, but yeah, that's where we're at today.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Okay. Great. Sounds good. Yeah. And we, you know, we would also be a direct replacement for intercom. And is Finn in the chat featured the AI chat?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Yes. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. Okay. Perfect. We also have something for that as well, which I'll show you today.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Can you see my screen?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes, sir. Awesome. Well, I'm just going to walk you through a couple of slides here and then walk… you through the product as well. And I think you mentioned it's about five people in total that would be using something like this?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  That's correct. And.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  then which team is that specifically?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Our customer support team?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And is it like you're fairly certain you're going to be moving away from Zendesk or? Yes. Okay. And then as far as you have a timeline in place for when?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  You're going to move, I think it's like before March is when our yearly contract renews. Okay?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  So in Q1, so in January, and so I lead engineering, I lead product engineering here at health. Note engineering is starting to set up in January intercom, so we can basically have it at the same time, right? So we can play around with it, see what it is. But we have until March in order to fully move away from Zendesk.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So you're just testing intercom in January?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Yeah. So intercom, we have it's free from what I can tell, basically, we have a free there's, a free tier. So we're playing around with it with some of our internal tooling, putting some documents in there, playing with Finn, which is the chatbot product. So that's what we're going to be doing sometime in January. Okay. Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Well, sounds good. Perfect. And yeah, just a little bit of background about where hiver you know, came into place here versus kind of these other help desk platforms is that, you know, today… you know, support teams are really tired. They're manually sorting these conversations. They're rewriting a lot of the same responses, information is scattered across different spreadsheets, chats, multiple health, best systems. And, and the challenge is clear, that these things are all holding teams back. And with hiver, you know, you can set up rule based workflows handle simple tasks, set up complex scenarios and just really easy to adapt it all. It's a single source of truth… you know. And with these legacy help desk, you know, they haven't really been built for this new AI era. They're they're clunky, they're hard to navigate. It's hard to set up new workflows, right? So that's where hiver comes into play is that it's very easy to use. It's. Really easy to make adjustments and changes to different platforms. That's actually a huge reason why people come over to us from Zendesk is most of the time, they just find that it's very clunky. Is that it's hard to set up, you know, desired workflows, and use different scenarios as well. Is that something that you found with Zendesk that it was kind of hard to use? Exactly? Awesome. Yep. So, yeah, this is where this is where hiver you know, comes into play at its core. Hiver uses AI to automate a lot of these things to set up workflows. And we have over 10,000 teams already using hiver ranging from fast growing startups, to global enterprises all to simplify workflows, respond faster and deliver the kind of support that customers need. We've been around since 2017. We've raised over 30,000,000 dollars in funding. We're used by over 10,000 teams globally with some of our largest customers including companies like flexport, vacasa, and capital one. Just to name a few. We also work with a lot of health care companies, new hope fertility, visiting angels, crossover allidade, we're also hipaa compliant is hipaa compliance something you would need for this? Yes?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  So, that's part of the conversation and why I'm in it because I also lead security and it here is making sure hipaa compliant and, or at least a baa, you know, we have a lot of customers who do put in sensitive data. We do work with a lot of hospitals and clinics in the U. S. So that is a must and then they must be soc two, type two certified as well. Absolutely.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, we're both soc two certified and hipaa compliant. So, yeah, that's another, and that's why we have a lot of customers in the health care space. So I'm going to go ahead and pull up my platform… here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Can you see my screen?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Yes, I can. Yes, great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, this is the web browser. You're just going to log in using either your Google shop, right?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Yes. Okay. Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. So you come into our web platform here and you're just going to log in using your credentials there. And then what you're going to see on the left is you're going to see two things. You're going to see these folders and then you're going to see the chat here. So, the main two channels that hiver supports today are email and chat. Do you have any shared email addresses set up like support ad, info, ad, anything like?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  That we do. But right now, we have those routed directly to Zendesk. So anything that comes into those, they automatically get routed as a new ticket inside Zendesk, perfect?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And you're moving away from Zendesk, right? So you would need to find a replacement for that?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Intercom already has this feature integrated as well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  What do you mean?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  You can give it a support email that automatically gets integrated into their platform?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, right, right. So, what I'm just asking here too is, right. You haven't decided to move to intercom yet, right? Right? We.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Haven't, but the platform that we're looking at, we don't want it to have like a shared inbox, if that makes sense?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, you don't want it to have a shared inbox? No, no, no. Why is that we?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Don't want people to have to go into Gmail with a shared inbox, we want everything to be on one platform, oh?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Great. Yeah, exactly. So I guess I'm just getting a little confused here, but basically what I'm telling you is that we have that as well. So you would connect, you would connect your shared inbox to hiver. And then that way you don't have to go into Gmail, like you said, and you can have the email here and the chat right here, right? So how it works is you connect the shared inbox to hiver and.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  then people are going.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  to have access to that to all the emails that come into that address. And you can also set up multiple if you have, do you have multiple shared email addresses you use or?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Just one? Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Well, you can just connect that one folder here to hiver, and all the emails are going to be handled here in hiver… right? So how it works is once an email comes in, you're going to see this panel on the right hand side. And… this panel can get assigned to different people on the team. There's tags for it. So you can categorize these emails and then there's also statuses for them as well. And we have different automations as well where these can get automatically assigned to the right person on your team. They can automatically get tags. So very easy to set up automation. So before you even answer an email, it can get categorized assigned to the right person on your team.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  That's great. And then you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  can also see, we can also apply slas. So basically what these slas are is if you know, for certain emails or if you wanted them applied to all the emails in the inbox where it's like, okay, somebody needs to reply to this email within two hours or we want to be notified that it's late. Got it. Okay. And then down here is the notes section. This is where you can put notes. You hit the at mention button. Everyone's name in the account pops up. So I can be like, hey Cor, can you help… anytime you get assigned something or at?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Mention?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  On something you're going to get a notification in this bell icon right here, and.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Can you map the notifications also either to something like slack. So if someone mentions you in the platform, it sends you like an email and, or slack?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes, you can get slack notifications. Okay. Not email notifications. Not.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Email just slack notifications?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. And then you can reply to the emails directly here in hiver. You can set up templates that can be shared with everyone. So those kind of reoccurring emails that you get, you can set up email templates. We have an AI chat gpt feature where you can like fix the grammar, make it shorter all conveniently in there. And then we also have an AI co pilot as well, which very similar to our AI chat which I'll show you can actually draft replies for you… and it'll give you a prompt you choose which prompts you want for accuracy purposes. And then it also is going to ref, it can also, so it's going to reference past emails that you've gotten. And then it's also going to be able to reference. I just want to double check what it is right now. It's going to reference a knowledge base documents or snippets.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, if it looks good, you can insert it, make changes to it. You can talk to the AI too if you want to make it shorter. You need it to reference something. So it's quite interactive. Got it. Awesome. And then here, you can also see the team view. This is going to allow you to see all the open emails across the team. So I can say, okay, we know I have 50 open support emails right now. I can see that Cole has six of them. You know, Manoj has five of them. I can click on any of these emails. I can see all the back and forwards. I can update and close them out et cetera. So you're going to have complete visibility into all the emails that need to get done. And then also let's just say Cole's out for today. I can click on his emails. I can answer them or I can easily just take them and assign them to somebody else. Got.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  It. Okay. Is there like a on call rotation like some out of office? So like auto forward and auto change and that's something intercom has? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yep. The team's going to be able to select their availability… for email and chat… and we can set up different workflows like round Robin availability… etc.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then we also have reporting.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So you select the mailbox that you want to see. We also have reporting for the chat which I'll spend like the last five minutes on. What would you say? The break off is by the way between email and chat? Is it like 50 50 or you?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Get, we don't have chat today that's why that's something we're trying to get into. As I mentioned, now, we have Zendesk and we don't have chat. And that's why we're looking for something that has chat got.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It got it. And ideally, you're looking for something that has both, yes, preferably?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Fantastic. So with the email, you select the mailbox that you want to see, you select the timeframe, you can see things like how many emails did you get in the past month? How many emails did you resolve? You can slice and dice this data however you want, you can group it by custom fields. You can group it by person. You can filter by dates however you want. So all this information is, you know… manipulative, you can also see the workload across the team, how many emails people have sent out the performance of each team member, for emails? What's their average response time? How long is it taking them to resolve emails? We can also include things like customer satisfaction surveys as well… with the tag. So you can say, okay, last month, our support team got, you know, 11 emails about billing questions, or in the last month, we got nine emails about, you know, how to use AI features, et cetera. Also with those SLA set up, you're going to be able to measure things like violations and compliance. So, last month, how many times did our support team not respond to those emails in the set times that we set versus how many times did they do it? And again, you can slice and dice this by person or any types of information that you want to see. More of… you can also build custom reports. This is all exportable to a CSV file. And you can also set up custom dashboards.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So that's the email portion before I move on to the chat for the last, you know, five minutes or so? Any questions about kind of how the email works? That all kind of makes sense? No, this.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  All makes sense. Yeah, it's pretty straightforward. Okay. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And I would say, you know, the bulk of our business originally that did come from email. So this is a channel that we support very well. It's easy to use like I said, and setting up these automations. And, you know, especially bringing over customers from Zendesk. So that's something that we're very familiar with.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And exactly, you know, a lot of the reasons that people came over is that it felt clunky and impersonal and, you know, with hiver, it's very easy to handle it. And then lastly, we got the chat here. The chat is conveniently in hiver as well. You're going to get all the chats here so that you can see it. You can set up multiple chats… and it's going to tell you where it came from. It can capture things like their name, their email, their phone number, and then you can assign it to different team members, update the statuses tags and you're going to be able to see everyone's going to have their own mind section where they can see their own chats. And then also, you're going to have a team view as well where you're going to be able to see it across the team as well. And then even the bot, you can see, you can also see these chats too.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  How do the bots escalate to humans? How?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Does that work? Yeah, perfect. So what you're going to do is you set up these flows within hiver. And… so the flows are going to look like this. So you decide how you want the flows to work, right? So an inbound message comes in and then we can set up AI to handle it. And then the AI just like in the copilot I mentioned is going to be able to reference a knowledge base, notion articles, documents, or snippets with more things coming soon. So it's also going to be able to reference URL websites. But basically, yeah, you set up a flow like this where you know, if it hasn't been resolved by the AI or the bot, then a handoff is going to get triggered.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then we also have like a playground here where you can test these flows out and make sure that they're up to your liking. Perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then did you envision kind of put in and basically how it works is… you, it's a script that you're going to, put on, you know, on your website? Yeah. And then do you have like an online knowledge base as well? Because that's something that you can also set up within hiver? We.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Do, yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, within hiver, you're going to be able to set up a knowledge base. Ours looks something like this with the different articles here so that people can access. And then down here is the chat that goes right into our chat. Yep… you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, these are the different packages, of our plans. And we do sell in buckets of five and you have a five person team… now… and what gets?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Included on those fives can like add, do admins get included? So like from, for example, myself, I'm like an it admin for everything. Does that also get included in there? Or is that outside of the five it's.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  included in the five? So, any individuals who need, any type of access would need a license?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Got it. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And is that also?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  True, for like reporting for let's say that someone wants to go check billing month to month or something like that. Yeah, exactly.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Anyone who needs access to the reporting, I mean, also the reporting is exportable. So, if, you know, if you really didn't want to, you could export it for them or take a screenshot and send it to them. But other than that, yeah, if they wanted to access the reporting within hiver, they would need a license.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Got it. Okay. So that's then, yeah, we.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Have these are different packages here. So the main thing the main thing for you. And then we have an annual plan, a monthly plan. The main thing for you is you wouldn't need the elite package just because the elite packages are only hipaa compliant package.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Okay. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's around 105 dollars per user per month to use it. And it comes with absolutely everything, the chat, the email, all the AI features as well. Integrations, I think I saw. Do you use Hubspot by chance too?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  We, do we're moving off of Hubspot? Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We're moving to Salesforce or I?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Actually don't know, okay, but this is a little pricier than all the products we're using today, just fyi, the hiver, just because we do have to have someone in finance and myself do that. It's going to equate to about 9,000 dollars a year because of the elite package.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  9,000 dollars a year. Let me see. 500. I think it'd be for five people, right? Seven.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Because you just said admin?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, yes, okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah, absolutely. And yeah, I mean, definitely, this is just, you know, preliminary pricing as well. We're happy to work with you on pricing. Is it like… around how much is the other ones that you're looking at per person?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Closer to that 65 dollars a month as you're hovering over?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Well, listen, yeah, we have room. We can definitely work with you on pricing here.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Okay. I'll have to, again, we'll chat with the team and I'll look at this. I was taking notes as you were talking through and then I will definitely take a look at the pricing page and see what's included and not included there. One question that I had around chat features is that a separate pricing that's included meaning… completion rate. Is that like an all inclusive cost all inclusive?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Cost too? Yeah, that's another huge reason too. Actually, we, I brought over multiple people from intercom, because they get charged per usage of it and that can get, very expensive. And like I said, we're happy to work with you on pricing. We can get quite competitive as well. Amazing.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Amazing. Well, thank you, Matthew. That's very helpful. Awesome. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And would it be, I'm going to email all you all the information. Does it, does it make sense to like put a follow up on the calendar here? Not yet.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Some of my team will be out but I'll get back to you again, as we look at this and start looking on our side. I will definitely be following up with you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. And when can I expect to maybe hear from?

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  You… probably third fourth week, of January. So just give me some time man. Definitely, your team has been aggressive, in the getting me on. So I'm pretty sure I'll hear from you guys.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  First. Yeah, no, absolutely. You shouldn't hear from us, for a couple of weeks here. Have a, have a good new year and we'll chat soon, thanks.

Christian Jimenez (christian@healthnote.com):
  Christian. Thanks Matthew. Bye bye.
