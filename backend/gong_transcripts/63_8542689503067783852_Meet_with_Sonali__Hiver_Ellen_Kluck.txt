================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Ellen. Hey, hi. Can you hear me? Hello? Oh.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Hi. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hi, I'm doing good. How's it going for you?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Good. How are you? Oh, there it is.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Looks like there's a delay. Ellen. Do you mind if we go video off? I think Google meet's just acting up. I just dropped off an internal meeting video, just made things haywire.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Oh, no worries. It's working now for me, so.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. I.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Think it was just Adam coming online.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Probably that gotta do something about it. But anyways, Ellen, pleasure meeting you love the shrug, love the shrug. Is that Egyptian or like the British?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  No, it's incan?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Incan. All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Great stuff. Pleasure meeting you. I'm Raghav. I work with the wizarding angels business unit on hiver, you know, I've worked with Thomson and Thomson's pretty closely over the last three, four years plus that they've been with hiver right now. I take care of hiver's account management motion, which means I will be a direct point of contact working alongside the wizarding angels franchise as a whole and ensuring any growth in the partnership is catered to and helped in terms of next steps and understanding hiver as well. Now, on the other hand, yeah, I think Sonali's, Google meet is acting up.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  It looks like she's having some issues. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, she's the success manager dedicated to wizarding angels and the hiver partnership. So she works more closely. She will be kind of like your go to person when it comes to operational efficiency, everyday implementation, questions, things like that. And yeah, those are our roles. So we'll just give one more minute. Sonali. All right. I think we're sort of good to kick off. And so Ellen for today's, call, there were two things I wanted to do firstly obviously understand a little bit about the scope of where you're coming from, the nature of the teams, the kind of stuff that you want to accomplish with hiver. And if it helps show you like a brief little overview, and then we can plan ahead for like an account kickoff on the subscription.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Okay. So I'm trying… to figure out how to streamline all of our lines of communication into kind of a ticketing system. So I want to understand if hiver can meet the needs that we're looking for. So we're a little different from other visiting angels. We use office 365. We do not use their Google account. We were set up before they converted… to Google. And so it was really clunky. And we made our own system. So we've got Microsoft 365 for emails. And we also have a, we do have phone and texting, but I believe, I wasn't sure if that's something you guys integrate with phone and text. Oh, I'm.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  sorry?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Email, phone and text. I think that was it. That was it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So firstly, on the office 365 environment, hiver does have a standalone web application that we're calling it, that caters specifically to customers on Microsoft. So if you've got like, do you have a team address there or is it emails going to everybody individually?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  We have, so we all have our emails individually. But then we also have groups set up.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So, yeah. So from that perspective, we can pretty much replicate a similar experience that hiver provides on Gmail. But on the outlook instance and the version of hiver over there, you know, it is full transparency of product that we launched about nine months into this year, like earlier this year. But the Q1 is when we launched it. So in terms of feature priority today, we're at a stage where we're very close to Gmail capabilities, right? And so as we continue uncovering more of the kind of workflows you need, the kind of the outcomes you're looking to achieve, that would help us sort of weigh out the best way of going about it. But to answer your question, right at the very top, hiver will be able to support office 365 groups and office 365 user accounts and work on the same environment. Brilliant. So from like an everyday perspective, the first thing I want to chat about or understand more about is what is this group? Email? Like what kind of emails do you get there?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  So, and that's why I was so in, we don't do a ton on email. I feel like our organization is more text based and more text communication. So I'm so when it comes to.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm so sorry for cutting you off. Yeah, when you say text based, you're talking about like regular text messages like SMS and stuff like that.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Yeah, we use an apple, we have like an apple account and an apple device that we share among all of us and we receive those texts in and we're finding that it's getting a little overwhelming to manage 130 employees via text. So, we're trying to say, we're trying to figure out what our best solution is. And I know that the, you know, matt's organization or Matthews he does, you know, he does. I don't know like 500 caregivers or something he said like it's a ton. And so I'm like I don't know if we just need to completely change and just not allow text message. It's a, it's a great way to get fast information, but I'm wondering if that's communication is getting lost. Things aren't being handled great because of it. So, but I don't think hiver doesn't take in text messages, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Don't, we, OK. So when it comes to SMS or text messages, how we call it, we, so far at hiver, we don't have a direct integration for any kind of messaging platform. Like not even like the skilled business to business kind of platforms leave alone like a direct apple messages tie in. But with that said, we are working on, you know, just basically revamping the hiver web app experience, the one that includes your outlook support as well. And we're effectively going to be revamping, relaunching the whole thing in Q1 next year. We're going to be out with like more clarity on that later this year. Pretty much by the end of this month, we're going to be starting to get a lot more clarity internally in terms of what's available at launch, what's going to be available in a phased manner? What does that look like, right? So long story short, text messaging is on our radar. Is it something that we can help you with right out of the gate today? Definitely not. Is it something that, you know, direction we're focusing in something we could be able to handle down the line. Definitely, yes, that's what I want to leave you with? OK?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Yeah. And I think so. And then I guess another question for, because I know we utilize the platform axis care. So do you guys have an integration with wellsky, the scheduling software? He mentioned something about it working with their scheduling software?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Interesting. And when you say working with it, what are you looking at the outcomes? Like what would you?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Try. Yeah. So everything, so a lot of what we do in our scheduling software will result in a, it results in an email to us. And so I guess we could organize it that way. Then we could have the email come in and reviewed and then go to different teams to be handled that's probably where the efficiency would be for that. So, yeah, I'm trying, we're at a tipping point right now in our organization where I'm trying to figure out what system would be best to scale at. So I think, we get, you know, 100 to 150 emails a day and a lot of it's just informational. But being able to sort and assign could would be a very useful task. So, yeah, that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Makes sense. The one thing that I do want to find out, you know, is in terms of at least looking into one quarter in the future, right? You know, in terms of that, what kind of, what kind of perspective are you looking at from an outreach perspective for your customers, right? You mentioned that SMS or text messaging is something that you might scale into. You might not have that. So, I think having that, you know, a little more thought out would also help in terms of the decision for the tool not just for hiver, just in general. Yeah, that said when we're talking about a hiver first approach, obviously, when it comes to emails, we've got pretty much all the bells and whistles that you would need in terms of getting the whole thing accomplished when it comes to the scheduling software bit, as long as it flows back as emails into hiver or into your inbox, either ways you should be good in terms of being able to handle that a whole lot better and address it better as well. Right now. You'd also mentioned phone lines. And again, that's a direction that we would be looking to invest in, implement it and have more options opened up. Do you use any kind of software like something like RingCentral? Or Aircall? Yeah, we.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  use ring. Yeah, RingCentral.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  RingCentral. All right. That's great to hear, great to hear because a lot of our customers have been asking about it. So it's one of the few applications that's top on the radar again might not be something that I would be able to show you what it is, how it works and what it's going to do right out of the gate today. And so, yeah, that's effectively pretty much where we're at right now. The next thing that I want to find out is with regards to the timeline of the whole thing, right? I'm guessing you're at this point, exploring different tools, seeing what's available in the market. So what kind of timeline are you working against in terms of?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Yeah. So I think I'm kind of doing exploration right now just to understand, what would help us. I would like to have something in place by Q1 of next year because we are… going right now, we all work in one office and so you can crosstalk, we can, you know, be right next to each other and like ask each other questions, but we are going to be moving to have our team actually split up into two separate offices, but we're still one organization and there has to be some cross communication that happens. So that's kind of why I'm exploring this in exploring how we can ensure that everything that comes in gets assigned appropriately and that's kind of what I understood hiver could help us with.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. Yeah. And thanks for giving me that clarity on the timeline piece, right? That also helps me understand to what level of flexibility hiver might have as you progress deeper into the exploration cycle in terms of the scale or the size of the whole project? Like how many people, how many inboxes are you looking at when you said you want to?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Yeah. We only have 10 individuals with emails inboxes. So there's 10 of us and then there we have like five groups from those 10. So, you know, HR, business development, all team, things like that. So it's kind of that's really what we're looking to manage right now. So, and we're not going to be a lot of inboxes. I think we're projected out when we're like at we've… got like a seven year growth model. And hopefully at that seven years we'll have about 30.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Makes sense. All right. That makes perfect sense. So, that helps me understand the scale of things as well when it comes to managing the whole experience. And from a timeline perspective, that gives us a bit of leg room as well internally at hiver just so that we can understand how we are shaping up the product and the feature roadmap as well. That way we can see what aligns and what's going to be useful. And last question, right? And I'll show you like a brief little overview of hiver as it exists today. And more from like the email perspective. The last question that I wanted to find out was from a perspective of excuse me, from the perspective of handling the whole transition and picking the new tool? What are the must haves that you'd want the tool to support right out of the gates? Let's say, Q1, you're ready to roll things out? What are the things that should have outside of email management? And I'm coming at it from what does hiver not have today? What would be needed if we were to include you into partnership? We already have?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Yeah, I think, I, I mean, just outside of like email management, I think just like a task, task assignment is just the big thing that we're looking for. We currently already operate, with, eos, the entrepreneurial operating system. So, we do a lot of like, a lot of our meetings and our, to dos are put into a software called ninetyio. And so we use that, but then, it feels like a lot of the tasks that we have is like talk to this person, do this. So, it would be nice if there was kind of like, I don't know if I want to call it project management, but kind of, like a, a timeline of connectivity, on different topics.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. I hear where you're coming from. Got it. Cool. Well, that makes sense in terms of connectivity across topics. Makes sense. So, it's like you said, right? You're looking for something that's kind of like a lightweight Jira, or Mundi, com, where you get like that view of task one, task two, pending task two, task three alongside main conversation. All right. Well. And then first of all, thanks for being as thorough as you were with breaking things down for me. A lot of this, I am going to have to take back to the drawing board with my product team, understand feasibility timelines for that as well before I'm able to confirm what's on the horizon, what that timeline looks like. Okay. Well, that's it for the time being. I would, you know, if you're interested, still like to show you just like a quick 10 minutes of how hiver works, what it does? Yeah, yeah.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Absolutely.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. So yeah. So in what you're seeing on my screen is basically the default hiver experience when it comes to setting up a typical email based shared mailbox, email related alerts, and just running operations based on that. It starts with having everybody log into a web app. So it's going to be like a hiverhq, com link. You go in, there, you sign in using your Microsoft account. It's going to be signed in with Microsoft. So it stays secure all the way through once you authenticate. And if you're part of a hiver account, you're going to be brought to this interface that you see. And this is going to have or at least start with a list of inboxes. So consolidable is one of the groups that we have. Your case, five groups. We get them all in. It's. Going to be five stacks there. Every single one of that in itself access independent groups. So if the team is going to be overlapping between the five of them, then everybody's going to see five. If there are specialists people that just handle HR, just for finance, things like that, then you can control access based on it essentially meaning not everybody needs to see every email but they can, that's something that you want to do… within every single inbox instance is where the whole management piece of things happen. So, right, from the way you view these emails, so we've got a lot of these views as we call it or queues which pretty much show you different sets of emails unassigned for instance, is the open queue for the team? Just stuff that needs to be picked up, hasn't been handled. All of that mind queue is or mind view. Sorry is more for everybody's individual tasks. So it's going to be dynamic varies from person to person. The team view on the other hand is where somebody like you would be spending a lot of time from, tells you all the people in the team with a clear way to filter down to one person, copy emails that they've got individually. That whole part of things got it. And obviously customization is important. And so you've got additional ways in which you can basically create your own views, reliant on a few hiver elements there. All right. So, yeah, that's pretty much how the team would start interacting with hiver. Okay. Now on a day to day basis, right? Some of the foundational things folks would want to do assign emails straightforward, their assignment, reassignment all of that stuff. There's statuses to track completion of events. So open for new pending. If something's paused closed, if you want to resolve it and you continue building on top of it from there. Now, outside of the two defaults, right? Assigning and status, you've also got tags and that's going to be categorization. So if you've got folders and subfolders and things like that in outlook, those would effectively be what you create as tags on hiver or end up creating as tags on hiver. So that's all you can think about, right categories, subcategories. The whole lot. Now, in terms of tasks, as it stands, you could have a few dropdown based options or text based custom fields stuff that you can manually fill out. But we are working on AI backed tasks as one of the enhancements for this year. And so once that's out, I'm guessing a portion of what you're looking for, not the entire thing but at least a portion of what you're looking for, which is do this as step two, do this as step three could be attainable. I'm leaving that a little open ended because again we're just speccing it out. But yeah, so that's where that comes from. But effectively when it comes to categorizing an email and making sure it's in the right place and you can see it in the right place, you've got all the controls that you would typically need. When it comes to internal discussions, there's a notes section that is primarily for hiver users and hiver users only. So just the team that's with you on hiver instead of forwarding and doing a lot of that stuff. Just leave notes, start getting alerts within hiver, go back and track what's happening. The whole thing on the right side stays completely private to your end users. So people that you're emailing back and forth for them, it's just business as usual. Email goes in reply comes back that's about it. Got it. There's. Also like a bunch of activity logs, so that's pretty much the trail of what happened in that email, who handled it? When was all of that done? All right now. We do have some default integrations that you can do out of the box. So we tell you what like Netsuite, we connect with Hubspot, Salesforce, a bunch of those tools. And we are also going to be looking at API capabilities for hiver, basically the web experience of hiver. So some of the tools that you mentioned, especially the scheduling software, the way it works right now for the Constance and Gmail, is, comes back. As an email, then they take care of it based on the email in itself. If you're interested, we could explore the API route and see what that looks like, right? You know, it would require what kind of integration, the scope of it, depth of it. And we'll be relying on a few of those as well. Now, from just coming back to like the email handling perspective. This, what I showed you so far is the typical organizational experience. Email comes in. How do you know who's got it? What's the completion status on it? What's the category or type of email, all that stuff? And when it comes to sending out replies and doing your usual nine to five there, you've got a very similar, you know, experience when it comes to the reply configuration box, right? So you're going to be sorry, didn't realize there was going to be these random images that picked up. But yeah, effectively when it comes to the reply, you get a similar compose box… similar in experience to outlook or Gmail. In that sense. You've got your like email headers, you've got all the usual text editing formatting, hyperlinking, all that stuff. And then you've got a bunch of hiver elements as well like templates, for instance, could be things to pre create, share with your team. So it's easy to insert, get that information out. Get it going. Some elements within every hiver template can be used to autofill or autofetch. It can either be text boxes that show up when a template is used, so people can type it out on the fly or it could be things that are automatically fetched like first names, for instance, could just be get like fetch from the first address, right? Okay. Straightforward there. And yeah, outside of that, you know, you've got also a way to do what we call a share draft, that would effectively allow you to draft a message without forwarding it. Let the rest of your team help you on it. So collaborate on a draft live on an email. That way, two or three people working on the same thing. It's easier to do it as opposed to just sending back the funds, right? Interesting.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, we've got that as well. So it,

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  gives you full, it gives because I mean, like I have access to see everybody's email right now, but I have to individually go into their inboxes. So this is just like complete transparency across the organization.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Too. Yeah. I mean, like send it, move it to a certain status that all of that, you know, pretty straightforward one click actions. You don't need to do a bunch of stuff there. Okay? And then apart from that, you know, when you start branching out of this is where things start getting interesting for you. And so that's where things like workflow rules or nations start kicking in. So you can do condition based workflows on hiver. And those could be reliant on things like, you know, where's the email coming in from? Who was it sent to what's the context of it? What's the subject? Is there a certain element within the body based on all of which or some of this, you could effectively have the email delegated or assigned to someone. So that pretty much takes care of your initial inbound routing as we call it. You could have those emails categorized instead of going to somebody. So that way category shows up. And for things like finance, for instance, every refund can just be the one queue. You can go there. And like figure out who's taking what address, what's on the top bottom, go at it from that route too. Got it. You can also run SLA timers as well for every or some emails. So again, you get control there. Okay? If you want to run it just for like refund emails need to have a 24 hour completion time. That could be an SLA run. Chargebacks could be a 48 hour window. Yeah. And new payments or new invoices. On the other hand could be four hour window. So depending on the nature of the conversation itself, you could set up different timers and have all of these flow back as alerts that start notifying your team. So people both individually or you as a manager could all start getting these alerts that are part of your hybrid experience. And navigating through the actual conversations is always just like a one click feedback. So find an alert, click on it or direct on that email. You don't need to search. You don't need to do anything extra from there. And then apart from that, oh, whoops, just give me a second. Let me just get you like a different sandbox. We've got quite a few. So the other things is that you get like a fully fleshed out and built out reporting module as well. So it's not just about email visibility and task or everyday action based visibility, but you're also going to be getting a fully fledged analytic experience can't tell you dashboards, reports and a whole lot of snapshot worthy information. One click. You get to see volume, you get to see handling times, things like that or detailed information, you know, based on your SLA completion based on the categories you're running as a team. All right. So you get to see a lot of that bit of information here. I'm just going to probably search for users and see if there's some data that I can use to show you. Yeah, this one's got some. So if you look at it, you can go all the way down to like a user or an agent 360. It tells you their individual performance drill down all the way to individual conversations, sort of add to the count and the metric itself. All right. And yeah, I mean, on the other side of it, there's a whole lot of, you know, everyday useful stuff that these mailboxes themselves or groups themselves can have different to one. And the other slas, for instance is group based. So it's not at the account level depending on team and depending on outcomes expected. You could have different timers. Workflows. Again could be team specific. So it's not just a one size fits all. Maybe in the finance team, you want to have a workflow that sends out an autoresponder based on an invoice like this one here. And then on HR, it could be, hey if somebody writes in as a new enrollment, for example, you kick off a different set of actions, right? So all of those could be completely configured, you know, adding a tag, sending out a custom reply that's situational to that scenario that's not just generic and sending out a hybrid notification, right? So all of these could be scenarios and triggers against which you automate actions on hybrid. Okay. So, yeah, I mean, that was the quick little gist at least that I wanted to show you at this point from an everyday hybrid perspective. Yeah. And on the other hand, you know, just like with every business AI is a big part of our future plans and future roadmap as well. So for now, we've got, as the main element of hybrid AI is we're building out a similar version of copilot. Okay. We're building out something similar. The advantage and the difference that we're focusing on with the hybrid route is to make it more contextually aware. So, as opposed to copilot that caters to every type of business and has as generic as it gets. Yeah, copilot, we're purpose building it, we're giving you control of training, the model for your business. So that way it only gets data and information from the knowledge sources that you provide. It could be links, it could be PDFS whatever. But in a sense, once you train it, which is basically attaching your knowledge sources to that copilot piece, what it effectively does is gives the agents an easy quick way to just drop that reply. So they no longer have to go figure out what's this information from four dogs or put it all into chatgp or copilot and try to have that sort of outer response. Instead it becomes like a part of the hybrid experience just there, drop the reply runs to the sources.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So, I know I spoke for quite a bit without leaving a break. So that's been taking a break. No, that's if this made sense.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  It did make sense. Yeah. No, that actually makes, I mean I haven't copilot's kind of expensive in my opinion. I mean, it's 30 dollars per user and I was like, well, I don't know if my team will even utilize that, but I'm kind of liking what's happening here on this. So. Okay. So, do you build out like is pricing based on per user or is it as a company as a whole?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So for us, pricing is pretty much based on per user and the overall subscription cost is based on the number of people on hiver. Now, from a contracting perspective, we've got an existing contract with the Thomson team and the boosting angels business as a whole. So, you know, we'd effectively be looking at having your team on the same plan as well. They're on the highest tier with quite a chunky discount. So that's pretty much the kind of price point we would be looking at for your team as well. But if you do have, you know, preference to maybe start a little lower or you want to keep that separate and things like that, we're more than flexible on that and we can explore what that looks like for your franchise separately cost per person. We've got like three different tiers for you to choose from. In a sense, it differs on the amount of things you can do within hiver and full disclaimer, AI as a feature suite as a whole is also a separate add on hiver as well. All right. So that's the general understanding of the commercial piece of it. So, for example, you know, if you're starting pretty, you know, you want to start at the level where you want to grow into some of these features and things like that, we could look at one tier below the highest plan that the existing teams have got, you know, give you like a three month head start on it and we can reconvene after three months, see if it makes sense and then align you on the actual contractual terms.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So yeah. And if you're interested, what I can do is put the information over in an email after the call, where I'd send over some of the collateral as well. So you can explore it. And what I'd like to do is after the call, obviously touch base with my team, understand the texting and the phone calling piece? Okay. See if there's a timeline that I can have attached to it, and maybe we can reconvene in probably around the first week of December if that makes sense. And you can tell me, you know, if that's interesting, we can continue and we'll go from there. Yeah, that'd.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  be great. Yeah, I've got a leadership team that I meet with once a week. So we're in office next week and then I'm out for the following week so I would love any information so that I can share that with them. And then I'll also just touch base with them to see if this is in alignment with what we're looking for as far as efficiencies within our organization. So, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sounds great. Ellen. So I'll have information sent over to you before the end of the day today. You can explore it. Any questions, any doubts? Feel free to write back to me. And on that note, thanks for hopping on Ellen. Yeah, no.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Problem. It was nice to meet you. We'll talk later. Bye.
