Mugunth:
  hello? Yus, good morning. How are.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  you? Good morning. Good. How are you?

Mugunth:
  I'm doing great as well. Thanks for asking. Okay. So we'll get started. Yus, first thing first. I mean, like, will you get a chance to test out the sentiment analysis AI functionality which we enabled in the last call?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Yeah, I don't I didn't see that it works like I'm looking at all the emails. I don't see that. I don't see it on my, from my end?

Mugunth:
  Could you please share your screen?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Wait over here.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Can you just please go to the admin mailbox? I mean, the admin panel over here?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  What I'm sorry, go to the admin panel.

Mugunth:
  Yeah, admin panel, yes.

Mugunth:
  Under that, please, click on the hiver, AI on your left panel. Yeah… just go to the sentiment analysis. Click on the one figure option. I see it. Yes, we need to enable this, the option one you see here?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  This.

Mugunth:
  no, this one?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Here.

Mugunth:
  Could you just toggle it? Yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  And now we're good.

Mugunth:
  Now we are good. So now, I understood why you were not able to kind of, you know?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  It's weird because I saw your, the, when you sent me an email, then I did see the sad face. I don't know it's weird. Okay. But from now on, it's going to work. You think it's going to work?

Mugunth:
  Yeah, it will work. So make sure that you've enabled it, so.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Let's see again. Yeah, it's enabled.

Mugunth:
  It's enabled. So, once that's done, and you can also try on your recent conversation if you want to see. I mean, like you could just go back to the same admin panel… right? No, no, this, the sentiment analysis.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  No, no, no, no, just what do you want me to do?

Mugunth:
  Just go to the same admin panel over here.

Mugunth:
  And go to the AI… go to the sentiment analysis, click on the configurations option, and then click on this option called, try on recent conversation. Just so, yeah. So it is working. So just keep this switch alone toggled on ears so that you know, you could capture the sentiments of your customers effectively. Okay?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. Sounds good.

Mugunth:
  Yeah. All right. Okay. In our last meeting, we just explored about the AI tagging and AI sentiment analysis part. So now, just go back again to the hiver AI just, click that again. Yeah. Now we'll look at the thank you detector. So, basically, what it does is I see that it's been enabled. So, whenever you have resolved a query of your particular customer, and then the customer email you back, saying that, hey, thanks for sending this tax report for me or thanks for filing this report for me, what hiver does is hiver will automatically open the email whenever a new conversation is received. So, by enabling this thank you detector option, what it does is the hiver's AI detects that this email conversation is being resolved and the customer is just sending a thank you email, it will ensure that the conversation doesn't go to the open state from the closed state. So that's what this thank you detector functionality does for you.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Not that big of a deal between me and you, but, okay.

Mugunth:
  Yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay.

Mugunth:
  Yeah, that is, yeah, that is a lot of anxiety.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  That's very time consuming. But for our end to close such an email, but, okay, wait, give me a second. No problem.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Good.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Yeah. Can you hear me?

Mugunth:
  Yeah, yeah.

Mugunth:
  Okay. And then we'll just move to the next set of hiver features. There is another option for AI co pilot, just click on that right next to AI.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Can you remind me what's the AI tagging does? What does it do?

Mugunth:
  So basically, what?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Ah, according to our tags. Yeah. Okay. Nice.

Mugunth:
  So, it auto plays the tag say, for instance, recently, we just created a new tag called new business coming from website, right? So what we could do is just go to the configure option. Maybe we could just test that out as well. Okay, just click on add tags… go and click on that. Yeah, the new leads select that click as add. What you need to do is once that particular, now you need to go to the manage stats section right next to it. Okay… just click on add tags one second for me.

Mugunth:
  Yeah. The new business, it's not.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Here, anymore… the new lead, I don't see it.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Just cancel this and go back again. Ah, got it. Yeah. Now, here we are just click on this option. What you need to do is just click on this update option. You need to kind of, you know, describe what this tag is all about. It's like you just need to give some description in terms of like this tag gets applied whenever we get a new lead from the website. And once you have finished writing this description, you need to go and apply this tags for 10 emails. Could you just go to?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Ah, okay. Now, I understand, then he learns how to, okay?

Mugunth:
  Yeah. Then it learns. So what happens is whenever an email comes and it matches the, you know, the criteria and the description which we have provided here, our hiver, AI learns from this and it will start auto, applying these tags for you.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Now, let's say you saved, I'm just gonna just for, yeah.

Mugunth:
  Yeah, just click on save changes. And then now.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  I need to click 10 emails.

Mugunth:
  Yeah. So, and then we should go to your shared mailbox, and then you need to go and add the stack.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Let's see how I do it… right? Go to the shared inbox. Aha,

Mugunth:
  yeah… just go to the one, the set of emails where you would typically be applying the new leads tag, just go to those set of emails, just start applying this particular tag?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  I don't understand. How are you?

Mugunth:
  So, you… mentioned that, no, no, no, can you just go to the emails which you receive whenever a new lead is being assigned to your team or whenever? Yeah, yeah, just go to those set of emails. Yeah?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  yeah, for example, this one, yeah.

Mugunth:
  Just start applying this tag, how go to the tag option here. Where is it here? Yeah, in that, click on new, this, apply. And similarly, you need to do this for nine more emails for our AI to understand. Okay, now that you have, it's more like, you know, to ensure that it tags accurately. So, our AI tag has accuracy rate of 95 percentage and above. So that's why you are given a description. And you're also tagging close to 10 emails. So, whenever the email contains these text or these body or subject lines, it needs to be tagged as new business leads. So, once it learns what it does is, it would, going forward from the eleventh email onwards, whenever you receive these sets of emails, it gets tagged automatically and it doesn't stop there with these tags. We can also run an automations in the backend. Let's say that whenever a new business tag is applied, assign it to this person from your team and so on. So that's, what the AI tagging is all about. It's. It also helps you to classify the incoming emails. Once you have classified the emails, you can also kind of, you know, assign it to the relevant team members and so on.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  I understand. Okay.

Mugunth:
  Yeah. Okay. Now, let's just go back to the hiver admin panel. Now, let's just go back to the hiver AI module. Okay. So, this is where the things get interesting here. So, there's this another feature called ask AI. So before even exploring this feature, I have like to understand your use case better. Do you have any, you know, sop documents, basically the standard operating procedure. So, whenever a tax request comes in, does your agents quickly go and review some of your internal documents, which kind of reaches them? Do you have any such documents?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Yeah, that the customer either asks a question, or, attach documents and we need to go over the documents and, guide them whether or not they need to provide additional information or just respond to their question.

Mugunth:
  Got it. So, while reviewing the documents which the customer sent, does your, tax consultants refer to any quick internal guides or any internal documents? Okay? If this is this, they need to do this? Do they refer to any internal documents?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  No, they don't use like a, like an outside assistance or something they're just, they're trained to, they're trained for it, you know?

Mugunth:
  Okay. How do you train them? So, do you give them some sort of manuals or documents which they need to review so that they're trained to handle their inquiries? Do you have anything else?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Using during the training period, usually a few months, but you want to try to explain to me what it does. I understand. Let's, let's, I tell you what I have low battery and I'm going to have to charge it. So, try to explain to me how it works.

Mugunth:
  Got it. Basically, what ask AI does for you is say, for instance, if you have a lot of your knowledge source documents sitting somewhere and your agents constantly refer to it while responding to your customers. So, more like an internal, knowledge document or solution articles, maybe that's the apt word I could give, they need to review it and then respond to it. What ask AI does is, whenever this particular feature, you train them on the set of documents or the knowledge sources you have, it would kind of, you know, give, that relevant solution article, whenever an email of that particular nature comes in and they can also kind of, you know, cross, verify, the list of the information which is present from there, right? Without switching tabs or going to that particular one. So that's what this ask AI functionality is all about.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Wait, does it, will… it be? So it's not like it's going to respond to the customer? Like learn the knowledge, learn the information, if, and if a customer asks a question, it automatically can respond by that he learned, they learned, like the AI learns the information, that then if a customer asks a question, they can respond like the AI can respond.

Mugunth:
  AI doesn't respond directly. What it does is, so, depending upon the knowledge sources which you feed, it would give you the suggested responses, say that if a customer is coming here with a, one particular query, this is the response which you could send for them, it kind of, you know, suggests you the response?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  It's what it's what it?

Mugunth:
  Suggests you, the response, relevant response. So, if you could just give me one example of a customer requesting your particular detail? And then I can try to fit and follow it. No, it's.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  not about it. They're going to ask me what is, when do I need to file a tax return? Okay? The question?

Mugunth:
  Okay. Got it. The us customers, right? Okay. Got it. Yeah. And let's say that if you have a document, more like an faq document, capturing these informations in terms of like it's before the end of financial year, which is like, in here in India, it's like a, let's say that it's before March. If you fed this information to AI, what it does is, whenever an email comes here, your agents can quickly refer to those knowledge documents right within Iver… but in your case, it might not be relevant, is what my understanding is.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Again, I'm not really sure what it does like. Can you give me an example? It's like, let's say, I'm, going to enable it, knowledge source. I'm going to upload a knowledge source.

Mugunth:
  Yeah. Once you upload a knowledge document, what it does is, okay. Is maybe what we could do is just go to the highway AI again.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  How do I go back?

Mugunth:
  Just click on the back. Yeah, go to the AI copilot again. Okay. Let's just, toggle this AI compost option. Again… the second option, no, no, the second option. So, this is it. Yeah, enable this. Got it. Now, go to your emails, any of the emails closest and go to the emails. Just open any one of these emails. I'll just explain what this AI compost does for you. Just go click on any one of these emails. Ah, do you see some, on my note here? Do you see an app? It's going for you? What click on this option? Yeah. So, this is what ask AI basically does. So, whenever you kind of, you know, feed your knowledge, articles, to the ask AI module, your agents could use this window to chat and get response. Hey, when is the tax, filing deadline in the us? So, the AI would kind of, you know, give those information to your agents here. They could just copy, paste it and send it to the customer. But then again, this needs some learning from you. You need to train the AI on some of the repetitive questions which your customer asks your agents and all those stuff.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. It's only in English, from what I see, right?

Mugunth:
  Yes, it's in English. Okay. Similarly, what you could do is, this is what just one part of the module. Another one is, you can ask AI to kind of, you know, help you write email responses. So, just click on the same icon, this one. So, if you just, you already did that, hey, help me draft a reply for that, it will ask you a list of questions, request the clarification on irs. So just type one here… for the sake of them.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. Listen, I'll tell you about it. There's a, there's a, I hired like a team manager, a team project manager over here to do, to grow over all our systems. We're going to do like a transfer. We're going to move to, you know, Monday, the CRM?

Mugunth:
  Okay.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  So, we're doing a lot of things over here. We're working with DocuSign by the way. Do you work with DocuSign? Like, do you have like any feature of, you know, what DocuSign is?

Mugunth:
  Yeah, yeah. I know that. So we could sign the documents,

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Right. Electronically.

Mugunth:
  E signature. Yeah, more like an electronic service. Yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Nevermind. So.

Mugunth:
  What I'm.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  going to do now, I'm going to, because it needs more, we need more time and I don't have the time unfortunately, you all, you said that we can always upgrade, right? Or until, when do we have to, we have to, we have to renew the, renew, for next year? What's the date? So.

Mugunth:
  The due date is for November. What we could do is we could proceed with the renewal for now, this AI is something which we could be, which could be purchased at any point of time during a subscription. So that shouldn't be an issue.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Where do I see? Where do I see, over here? When, the sentiment is not good. Can I sit from over here?

Mugunth:
  Yeah, you can also click on the analytics.

Mugunth:
  And click on the sentiment option here. The one below. Yeah… that was the one which I sent earlier.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  But it's always, it's already closed, ah, they show only, they show also the open one, the closed.

Mugunth:
  One, yes, it shows the closed ones, the open ones and everything.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Can I, but if I already closed it, I don't want to see it again.

Mugunth:
  No, this, this, sentiment analysis analytics, what it does is it gives you a overview in terms of how your sentiment is spread across the three. This thing, it doesn't take into consideration the open or pending or closed. It's more for you to track how the sentiments are across your customer. It's irrespective of the status of the request, which you're handling it.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Why do I have 10, seven over here?

Mugunth:
  This is more like a banner, you just ignore this.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Ah, okay. Okay.

Mugunth:
  So, it's saying that it's the AI trial because we, earlier, the AI trial was, enabled for all the customers. Now, in next 10 days or so, all the AI features will be shut down. Either the customer needs to kind of, you know, purchase an add on to keep it active. So, I mean, Leander would have mentioned this to you during the earlier discussions.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. Let's let's go to the renewals. I want to see. Also the difference. Can you, can you please?

Mugunth:
  Okay. So… ears, right now, you're on a pro plan?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Where is it? It's over here? Where is it? Yeah, go?

Mugunth:
  To the admin panel and click on settings, the settings. Yeah, you could see the plan details. Yeah. So, right now, you're paying for 17 uses at 38 point seven one and your upcoming renewal is on November.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Now, what happened? What, what do I get when I upgrade like a year for, in advance? What's the, how much do I save?

Mugunth:
  Okay. Got it. So, use, right now, you're paying 38 dollars, right? So, whenever, if you're going for a standard yearly renewal, there will be a slight price increase, not a big one. It's going to be a couple of dollars here and there. So, this is something which we do seven to 10 percent. It's a standard price increase, which all the SaaS vendors do to keep up with the engineering cost and all this stuff. If you go for that standard renewals, but if you sign a two year contract or three year contract, we could definitely work out some response for you because in two year contract, we could keep things as it is for now. And then a slight increase in the year two, when you go for year three contract, what we could do is we could discount your existing subscription, and you'll be getting the maximum value of it. So that's how typically things are, so.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Right. Yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  So, we're fifth, one, two, three, four, five.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. So tell me a little bit… about the pricing again, what are my options?

Mugunth:
  So, is, so what would be the total user quantity you're going to renew? So during the earlier discussions with Leander, you mentioned that you're you also have plans to have it up to 20 users. Can I take that into consideration and give you a better offer? Because… the discounts are based on the number of years you're signing with us, and also based on the total number of users you are subscribing with us. So when I've looked at your account trend, so it's more like an upward trend wherein you have been just adding the users more than removing them. So I think if you could go for 20 users, I could work out some options and then send it to you, yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  But I thought, but I thought it's not them, but I'm not really sure how like I don't know if I'm gonna have 20 users got.

Mugunth:
  It, so in that case, what we could do was years, we also have an option called bucket pricing or tiered pricing within.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Wait, right now, I'm paying 39 dollars, yes, which is up, which is up from last year, right? How much was it last year? I think it was like 30, right? Something like that. I.

Mugunth:
  Don't think so. I'm… okay.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  I didn't make a second.

Mugunth:
  So,

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  let's see in, when was the last renewal over here? Yeah, 7,000, 488. Yeah. Let's see how many users we had. Seven… 488… 16, 468. You're right? So it's the same. Yeah, it's 39 dollars. It's.

Mugunth:
  same, so.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  And you're saying, so what happens if I increase it to let's say I increase it right now to 20?

Mugunth:
  Okay. What's.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  gonna happen?

Mugunth:
  So, if.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  or if I close for two years, right? Because, this, these are what's gonna give me like some kind of an advantage, right? Like.

Mugunth:
  Absolutely. Yeah, for two years. So, right now, you're paying 38, right? Years, I'm just I, because I need to get some approvals. So let's say that you're renewing for two years, what we could do was we could, which is the,

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  minimum, the minimum is seven, like it's the minimum right now, like I can, I cannot go below, right? Okay.

Mugunth:
  Yeah. You cannot go below. What we could do is for two years and you also get a flexibility to make the payments on a yearly basis as well. So we do not demand two years of payment upfront. We give you that flexibility as well. You could pay for 25 to 26 for now. And during the November 11, 20 26, you could pay for 26 to 27 subscription. Although it's going to be a two year contract, you can have the flexibility to pay it on a yearly basis. Right now. You're paying 39, right? For two year contract. What I could do is I could also renew you for the same pricing for, in year one and keep the price increase for the next year, maybe like two or three dollars here. And there I just need to do the math and then I need to see and.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Wait. So it's going to, so wait, it's going to be the same wait. So it's not a discount. It's the same price for next year.

Mugunth:
  So, yeah. So like I mentioned, I need to work out a few math. So if it's a two year contract, I could keep the same pricing because typically during the time of renewal, the SaaS companies do a minor uplift to keep up with the product improvements, engineering costs, and all those stuff. I can, we can waive that off for you and do the price increase in the year two. If you're going for a year three, what I could do is I could kind of discount your existing subscription and then do, you know, maintain it for?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  The same. So let's wait. So let me tell, let's talk about that up there's. Something… it's not really adventurous from our end because if we sign a two year contract, I don't know what's going to happen, you know? Like, so I'm taking a risk, so it's not worth for me the risk just to keep the same price. It's not like for me. It's not worth it, but you can look from your end. I'm willing. Yeah, I'm willing to sign a two year, even a three year contract with you guys, but it needs to be adventurous from our end, like it needs to be worthwhile. Okay? Because I'm taking a risk. I'm taking a risk. Yeah. Now, let's talk about the other option and maybe you can get back to me what happens if I already sign an increase of a minimum 20 minimum, like I have to meet the 20 users minimum, no matter.

Mugunth:
  what? Yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  I'm hearing you. I hear you.

Mugunth:
  Got it. So here's basically when you sign an yearly contract, the discount offer is typically not, would be not good value for you. Only if you sign a multi year contract, I could definitely work out some offers now that you're going to commit for 20 users. What I could do is I can also reduce the price which you're paying currently. So right now, you're paying 39 dollars, right? I could go down on the pricing for if you sign a two year contract. And similarly, if you're going for a three year contract, I can even lower your prices. So it all depends upon the tenure which you're signing for and the number of users you're currently going to be subscribed for. So just give me some time. I need to do some math and then again, no.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Worries, no worries. Yeah. So get back to me.

Mugunth:
  And then I'll get back to you. So. Okay.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  We need to close it by next week, right? We have seven days.

Mugunth:
  Yeah. So we need to close it. We need to close it. Let me just keep it secure. November twelfth is your annual date. So we need to close it at least by Monday. So would it be possible to schedule a quick 15 minutes call with you tomorrow? I can work on.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  The price, yeah. But tomorrow is Friday and we don't work on Friday.

Mugunth:
  Okay. How about on Monday?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Monday is good?

Mugunth:
  Okay. So what I'll do is I'll schedule a quick 15 minutes call with you on Monday. I'll bring you the options for two year contract and three year contract. And then, and,

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  the amount of uses, right? Like what happens if I, okay.

Mugunth:
  Yeah, I'm taking into consideration 20 uses. So you mentioned that there's also an option called bucketed pricing which I'll also link it for you. So that will also be even more economical for you. Just give me some time here. I'll just come back to you. So you do not work on Friday and Saturday, right? You work on Monday?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Right Sunday, we work on, Sunday through Thursday.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Sundays to Thursday. So what I'll do is I'll come back to you with an update on Monday and we'll just try to close it as soon as possible. Once you are fine with an offer, maybe I'll also come with the two proposals. You could pick and choose the one which is more exciting for you, and then we can take it for it from there because the reason for the urgency is your renewal is happening on November twelfth, so that's the reason for urgency use. That means.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. Sounds good.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Just give me some time. I need to get some approvals from my leaders, no.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Worries. No worries.

Mugunth:
  And then I'll come back to you with the proposals for two year contract, three year contract. Sounds good for 20 uses. Okay?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Sounds good.

Mugunth:
  Thanks. Thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  You too. Thanks a lot.

Mugunth:
  Bye bye. I'll just schedule a call on Monday that's the, yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Just send me.

Mugunth:
  11 a. M. Works for you on Monday. Yeah. Okay. 11 a. M, an hour later. Okay. 11 a. M. Israel time, I'll just send a meeting invite as well. Yeah. Thanks, east. Thank you so much for your time. And once this renewal is done, what we could do is I can also help you with some of the workflow, optimization things which we discussed. Okay?

Mugunth:
  Okay. Take care east.
