Date: 2025-11-13T21:30:55+05:30
================================================================================

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on, Lilli?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Hey, Cole. How you doing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Good. All right. There it goes. Cool.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice. I appreciate you hopping on here. So just to set a quick agenda, I saw you did start up the trial and you got some progress in there. So good to see that you're testing out the solution. Just wanted to use this time to answer any questions you might have as well as, you know, go through your environment a little bit to help with some of that implementation process. I did bring Manoj here on our side. He is a solution specialist here at hiver. So, yeah, I'll just kind of kick it on over. Actually, I'll let Manoj introduce himself and then we can just kind of take it from there.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Hi, Lilli Manoj here.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Hi, nice to meet you. I'm doing great.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So, I'm the pre sales manager at hiver.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  I usually take care of trial setups onboarding, team trainings and any kind of implementation setups. So, yeah, now, going forward, if you are all right, can you share your screen and just walk me through your setup so I can make sure everything is fine. And if anything else is required, I can help you set it up?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Perfect. Yeah, I can do that. Give me one second.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okie, dokie, I'll leave you guys over here real quick. All right. So this is generally what I have. So I… put in all the different shared inboxes that we're going to need. They're not necessarily set up. I didn't add myself as there are a lot of group gmails, like group accounts. I didn't put myself to receive any of like a lot of the emails… but that's what I have in here. The main question I actually had is if I'm in my own mailbox, can I assign an email that was sent to me to a team member without having them have full access to my inbox at all times? So like this one was a, I created a shared inbox of my thing, but my email, but I would like to just have my individual email separated but sometimes the client will email me and I can send it over to my team to handle instead.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Understood understood. So, Lilli, first thing, yes, it is possible and for that, you don't need to have a shared mailbox set up directly under your account. Okay?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Cool.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  You don't need that. So, for example, if you take the sixth email, which is just part of your personal inbox, the… one below that, the Parker and me, this is already part of the mailbox… you know, if you pick up an email, you open the email and you should have the hiver, right? Panel with you. So you simply first add it to the mailbox that you prefer, and then directly assign it to your team member.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Oh, okay. Cool.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Because you don't want your personal inbox to be a shared mailbox?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  No.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can go ahead and delete that and we can go ahead and delete the demo inbox as well.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. So, I'm going to go here?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  That is the initial part, and I presume everything else is a Google group, customer success, motorsport, production, sales and support.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Correct. Yeah. Everything else is good to go.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. You have to type in the exact thing. It's just a security check that we have.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Oh, I gotcha.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we have a lot of customers who delete the mailbox by mistake. So.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Now, that's done now. Okay. So, the rest of the mailboxes, so they're all going to have their own individual use case, right? Motorsport, support sales and everything. Yes. Okay. So, you also have a user under email address technology at teambrandit. Com?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yeah, that's our main admin account. I like. Okay, me, I wouldn't necessarily stay on hiver as a user. It wouldn't really mean anything for my workflow. This is definitely for more of our sales team. So eventually, I would just switch over to the technology account, and that's kind of how I can go in and make sure I can help manage everything, but it doesn't need to be under myself as a user. Okay?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, if that's the case, right? The groups that you have right now is I presume technology is already part of all of these original Google groups.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  It's an individual Gmail account. It's not a Google group.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No, no. I meant is technology part of product, customer service, Google groups?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Oh, yes. Yeah. It's an admin of all of the groups.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Sorry, I just want to know if it's part of the group. Yeah, they just,

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  receive, it receives no emails, but from them, but yes, it is.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, here's, the thing, right? Can you open any of the mailbox? Can you click on any of the mailbox support? Anything? So right now, if you notice next to your name, it's been listed as the primary user.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Right.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, on the back end, it's just a bit technical. So, what's going to happen is email is first sent to partners at teambrandit. Com, right? And it delivers the email to your account, and from your account, hiver syncs it to the shared mailbox.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. I see what you're saying. So in this case, this group would need to receive every single email, right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So the delivery, so the delivery setting in your original Google group has to be changed to technology as each email? Okay? So that it can work as a primary user?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  All right. I do have an email that I'll probably switch it to. I have an automation email that I'll set that up for.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Because you did mention that you're going to remove yourself from the hiver account, right? Yes. So I just want to make sure of this because what happens is, you know, without changing the primary user, and if you remove yourself, the email syncing would stop.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. I can do that then.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Now, apart from that, how about the rest of the users, Lilli, so they'll be logging into their individual emails and accessing the mailboxes right? Yeah.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Correct. Yes, I will, I need to add all of them in here. I'm just more making sure it's set up for them before I just place them in it.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Got it. And is it going to be different set of users in all of these mailboxes, or just same set of like users spread across the mailbox?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Different set of users. So like certain ones, we'll just say like modo support and this support one is going to be one team, but they should have access to like the customer service and production and then I'll have like my sales team and then they'll be in three other mailboxes and their team mailboxes.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Do they need to be subscribed to the Google groups as well?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Not required. You can just add them directly into hiver. It's just a primary user who needs to be part of both?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. Good to know. So, yeah, that's how I'll have that set up for them?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. And can you go into support? Can you go into the admin panel once I like go back and click on support?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. I presume you are part of the support Google group as well?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  The technology… one is, yes, but like you said, we have to swap it out to be.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because I think you are not able to see, but that is a small exclamation mark next to the support mailbox in the Gmail list view.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yeah. I see it's basically saying it's not receiving anything right now, yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Correct. It's because the primary user is not part of the.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yeah, I haven't finished the configuration, but I'm glad we got on this call because I would have done it wrong. So that's good to know.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Got it. So all you have to do is just make sure the other email address is present in both the platforms, Google groups and hiver. And once the email subscription is set to each email in Google group, add them to hiver, make them as the primary user and you can remove yourself from the account.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Now, another thing since you set up the hiver account, if you go into users and roles… you are listed as an admin, right? So you will have to log into the technology account or the other account who you're going to make as an admin and then remove yourself as the user.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. I can do that.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, that's it with the initial setup steps now regarding the workflows. So… if we take the partner's mailbox as an example, how many users are going to be part of the partner's mailbox?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Three.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Three. Okay. And do you have each… of the users handling specific partners? Or are they going to handle all of the partner emails that are going to come into it. So.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  It's not really like a round Robin style. Yeah, it would be more like as a receive them, they kind of figure out who's doing that. I've already kind of gone through the whole audit like every single one of these and set them up? How I think we're going to at least start off our workflows. Currently, we don't really have any form of like customer service management. So this is the first start is aggregating it into one area and then trying to figure out those workflows going forward?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Understood. Got it. Okay.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  We're a very basic setup right now. Got.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  It got it. Lilli. So have you seen the tags, the custom fields and everything?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yes.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, I think that would be your initial start of manually handling the emails, you know, as it comes in, categorize those emails using tags. Okay? And then assignment based on who's handling what. And then we can figure out all of these automated workflows.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And then those tags… are in. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So that's in the front end part of it, you have to go back to Gmail and that's there within your chat mailbox?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Got it. Okay.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  I think I'm in this one. No, I'm in.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Do you see tags? The last option right below all views?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yeah. Sorry, we got out of that part.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No worries. Yeah. So here you create those folders that you can use to, you know, group, the emails that are coming into your partner's mailbox.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. I know we don't have any emails. It's okay, buddy. That won't let me out.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Are you part of any of the groups or you're not part of?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  No, I personally am not, I usually manage it from the technology one, but like I said, the technology is subscribed to no email. It's just if I need to go in there, I can on the Google like admin side.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  More for management for our team, but I don't need to see everything.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Understood understood. Okay. So when you're handling the group emails at times, do you handle the conversations directly from groups? Google? Com?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  I do not, no, they right now, currently, they go into the individual's mailbox on Gmail. And then we have tags set up where it says like this is a modo support email and it just goes into their one inbox versus here having the separate inboxes and then being able to manage them within those.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  But, okay. I see. And then here, I can add the tags and then they can do… whatever they need to do to categorize them and we can automate based off those tags where this then. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So incoming email, if it's from a particular client or if it has certain keywords in the subject or body, then assign it to. So, and so person and also add this tag.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that can be your basic automation. And then there are automation tools that can do a lot more, you know, send out automated responses or, you know, update status, add a follower. All of these are possible.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, based on the tags and the assignment, you can also create custom views because right now, if you notice the, if you click on all views, Lilli?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yeah, I'm trying to think if I'm in any of them just to make… sure it doesn't tell me there's nothing we can see, but there we go. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So these are actually your five default sections, unassigned, mined, team pending and closed… all your new emails in unassigned. Once you assign the email to yourself or your or the team member, it goes into their mind folder and you will be able to see their progress in the team section. Okay? Because team is where you're going to see who's working on what… then you have the pending and the closed that relates to the status that you mark the email. Like along with these five default sections, the statuses are open pending and closed. Those are our default statuses. The first three sections is going to have emails that are in the open status, pending status and pending section, closed status and closed section.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. Are there, can we add additional like statuses?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, the default statuses cannot be changed because it's related, you know, it's related to the sections that we already have, but you can always use the custom fields, the drop down feature to have additional statuses set up.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah. Awesome. Well, I think that's all I actually really had you answered a lot of questions and I feel like I will be able to definitely set this up in a better way for the team. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Perfect. And now I was happy we were able to do this, Lilli. And then just to understand further, does it seem like the team wants to move forward with hiver? It's just more about testing it out a little bit further. Where does the team stand on that?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yeah, that's actually where I was going to ask you.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  I know we had mentioned a two week trial. I really don't jumped in here just to get it set up for them because I want them to be able to jump in with a fully set up account and have a true trial. Yeah, as like I said, I mentioned before we're using front right now, we're testing front and our commitment with them ends at the end of next week on the 20 second. So I would like them to have the week in between to like transition out. And then one week fully in hiver to really make our decision. Okay? Like that way they can do a true beta test through that, right? So I was wondering if there's a way we could extend our trial for this additional two weeks?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 100 percent. So, when would you need it extended to? I can extend it until the last day of the month?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yeah, that would be exactly in line with our timeline.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. So I will… schedule it, yeah, until the thirtieth, and then if there's we also like to offer, you know, training calls for the team before they get up and running, you know, on the trial itself, just to make sure everyone's aware of the features and functions, when would be a good time to do that with you and the team? Can we throw something on the calendar just to familiarize the team?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yeah. No, I would love to maybe throw something on if you have any availability on Monday. That way, I want to finish setting this up tomorrow. I was going to give them access to kind of start making sure they're like finishing off whatever emails they need to in front so they can switch over the new system.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. So let me pull up my calendar real quick too. And you obviously let me know what your availability is.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I can do, 11 a M est on Monday?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Okay. Let me just double check that they're good to go too.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yeah, that would be perfect.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So 11 a. M, we'll treat this as a training call. You'll just forward the invite to the team. Yes. Yeah, I can do that. Okay? Perfect.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. So I just sent over that invite for 11 a M est. On Monday. I can also start working on some pricing proposals as well, Lilli, if that would be helpful.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yes, that would be perfect. I'll get you. Yeah, I can get you a exact number. I think we're around. We'll just start high. I think about 40. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. People. Okay, perfect. So I can send you over that quote. And then in terms of the AI piece, we do also offer, you know, those AI features that we went through in our initial call like the co pilot tagging extracts… sentiment analysis, and additional 20 dollars per user per month. Would you want me to provide one proposal with the AI one without?

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Yes, that would be great. Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. Awesome. Well, glad we have some next steps here. Looking forward to getting the team up and running and let us know if there's any questions as you continue to set up, Lilli.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then one other thing to note… you will have access to our technical support team 24 seven, three six five as you're kind of setting up as well. So I'm just pulling up my screen here to show you how to access them.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So if you click on the hiver button, top right? And scroll down to instant chat support. 24 seven. This is where you can engage our team. They typically respond with under three minutes. They'll hop on a call with you if need be. If you need additional help setting up the mailboxes, getting the users up and running, or anything like that.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Perfect. Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then just in terms of future service too, we do provide that customer success manager. If you know, the hiver was the chosen vendor, something to keep in mind as well. Okay. Sounds good. All right. Perfect. Well, no, it was great to reconnect. Lilli. I will talk with you and the team next week and I hope you have a great rest of your week.

Lilli Greene (lilli.greene@teambrandit.com):
  Awesome. Thanks to both of you guys.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Take care. Thank you.
