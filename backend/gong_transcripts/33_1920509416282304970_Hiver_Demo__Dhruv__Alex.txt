Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  hello?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Hello?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Hi. Can you hear me?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yes, I'm Alex, can you hear me?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Yes, I can hear you. How are you doing?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I'm doing quite well.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Right. So, quick introduction… we are a small startup based in London and I'm really looking for this to do sort of help with a bit of delegation and a bit of sharing some of the email load without actually… sort of completely diverting those emails to them anyway. So, we have a business associate who sort of helps with a lot of customer support. So to begin with, I really want all the customer emails to be sort of visible… on his end as well without me forwarding emails and all those things. All that hassle. So this is one of the things that I want to get help with. But also there's a lot of operational help and such that we appreciate emails as, you know, is taking a lot more time than what it should. So it'd be good to understand overall how this works. How can I make the best of it?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So we do all those things… you know, creating shared email visibility is exactly what we do. So that's straightforward out of the gate. In terms of operational procedures. We have ways of helping with that. For example, we have a lot of people in like the freight business that use freight operations. So, you know, there's like typically like six different statuses on a piece of freight and then being able to kind of move those through the process in terms of the operations. Like, is there like a singular operations goal that they're kind of process that you have? Or are you thinking about multiple processes?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Multiple processes. So, for example, we have, okay, let me just sort of talk to you about two main categories over here. One is we sort of day to day customer support, and this is less customer like we are an RD company. So we haven't shipped out products yet, but this is more on inquiries, sort of getting a lot more feedback from them, their requirements, we build a heating system, right? So there's yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's an electric heating system, correct?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  It's an electric heating system. Yeah. So there's a lot more insights that we need from these customers. And oftentimes these customers are from different segments, like some can be developers, some can be homeowners, some can be contractors and whatnot. There's like sort of 20 different types of customers, right? So keeping a track of all of them. That's one part of the game. The second one is we are doing pilots trials with a lot of these customers. And these trials. Also there's like small bits like, okay, logistics and installation and manuals and certifications and whatnot. So the other part is somewhat similar to fade. They're like different stages of this entire pilot process that we need to keep track on. So we are using a sort of project tracking tool, but there's also a heavy load on email and customer engagement that's my particular role. So how can I best leverage? So I've already started using, not started using, but I've done the setup. I have the Chrome extension. I can share my screen as well. There are a few things that I'm still not clear about like all the emails are directly going into that one customer support tab that I've made. They're all unsigned right now. So, is that how it normally is? Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me walk through my screen for like five minutes and then we should go through yours on like the specific setup. Just, I feel like that might be a good starting point. Sounds good.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Sounds good. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And what you're describing exactly what we do. So just a quick background hiver is a Google cloud partner. We augment the Gmail inbox in order to create everything that you see in yellow, which is we call like a shared mailbox. Okay? You can have multiple shared mail depending on the plan. I'm assuming you were talking about one business associate and yourself. So just two users to start?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Well, no, yeah, great.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So you can, that would be considered our growth plan. You can have one email alias point into one inbox on the growth plan. You get two inboxes. Okay. The one step up there is the pro plan. We can have five aliases pointed to one inbox. And then, or unlimited. We've been changing things around, but the.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  whole concept is, can you quickly also explain like how do you exactly use these aliases? Is it just like an alias email just for hiver or? Yeah?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  No. So these are the aliases for your customers. So there's three different types of alias. So we could have like a Google group where if somebody, if it's set up today like that, if somebody replies to a Google group, it notifies everyone in that group. Instead, we could just point that to a shared inbox. We could also use a domain. So it could be like support at company name or info at. And then you could also have a personal email like, you know, you're one of the executives over there. I have other people that are executives that'll have their own, their whole inbox pointed towards a shared inbox. So then there are multiple EAS. If it's like a 24 seven operation are always able to go in there, pick up work. Everyone knows who's working on it. And then if, you know, change management on the employee side, you just have to like remove them as a user instead of changing all your passwords. Sure. So, yeah, those are the three main use cases. I think your use case is like info at company name, right? Yeah, great.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Yeah, more or less. Yeah. I mean in terms of all the customer support, one is my email and then a lot of general inquiries come to another email, which is contact at anzen, which is a general email. What are you saying? Info is like contact at anzen for us?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So actually let's start with your email. So I'm sure you get a lot of general emails that actually probably belong in the contact at, right? Yeah. So here I'm in my normal email inbox. Up top, these are all emails that I'm assigned that are open. Yeah. When you see all like the rich text added, this is just to show that there's open emails in my name, just that should be part of my normal workload. Okay. But then down here, we can pretend this is a customer emailing us, not a marketing automation. Yeah, I could add this to a shared inbox. Okay? So this is just a way to like clean up your current inbox. And, you know, get the work assigned out… now. I'm going to go to the support inbox. Yes, you're correct? Like everything's going to come in unassigned. We have the ability to auto assign work to people. Not sure if that'd be useful yet for what you're doing.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay. Just.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Because two people unassigned works great. Yeah, I could come in here. You know, Sarah has a question. I would just hit reply. All we can set up templates with you. Sorry, we can set up templates. Okay. Then when I'm done, you can set your preferred status. So I would just do send close and unassign. So then everything comes back to the unassigned box. Send in pending means that there's usually some work that's due on our end. So we still want visibility.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  And then what was that? So send pending is what exactly it?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Means that we're like marking it conditionally done. But usually it means that our company still has work to do on this. So we want like we want just the status to be something that is easy to find. Okay? So.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  It will send the email, but it will just keep stay in the status of pending there's. Still continued conversation that needs to happen in this. Okay?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Okay. And then on the right hand rail, we have a dropdown fields. So custom dropdowns. This is where I think that it would make sense to put like customer type or, you know, stage of delivery, right? Stage of product?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Right.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Then we can use these custom fields in a search later or what we call a view. Yeah, we can say, show me all conversations that meet the following criteria,

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And before I send this, yeah, sorry, you go ahead, yeah.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Just a quick question because this just makes starts making me think. I mean, there's a bit of there's… a bit of overlap of this with our CRM software as well? So, can this directly update? Like once we fill in all these tabs, which is what's the priority and what's the customer type and whatnot, can we integrate this anyhow? Will all this information also be sent to our CRM? Can we do that?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Which CRM is it?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  We are using Ato?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  We don't have an integration with the do yet?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay. Ato, a WTI o.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  A WTI o.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  A WT a TTI o.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that one?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  No, we don't have an integration with this yet. But, okay… how we typically work is we have like a connected app ecosystem. So we have over 100 apps where we're showcasing the cards here.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  The short answer is, no, we would not be able to integrate to Ato at this time.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Ato got it. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Actually, yeah, you can go on, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, it's like, okay, I've categorized this email. Now, let's just say your associate is, you know, write something out and they're like maybe I want a manager or someone else to review this because, you know, for a multitude of reasons, yeah, I can share this as a draft so they can type out their thoughts, share it as a draft and then they could either reassign it to you or they could at mention you.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So that's kind of the basic collaboration of how we think about it. Those at mentions are going to show up top right? In this notification panel… right? And we also have a mobile app. Okay. You know, just the shared emails all show up there.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Does it show? Yeah, I was going to ask you that when I use Gmail on mobile, it doesn't appear the same way. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, you have to use the hiver in Gmail app. Okay. Yeah, we essentially can't overlay into the Gmail app itself.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah. Right. Okay. So it will always stay unassigned. That's fine. And then each email we… can choose which group it goes to. Okay? And you can sort of mark things as well. Okay. What are the other functionalities that I can use with this?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we have our unassigned here and you see the number seven on the right? Then we have mine with number one. And then we have team with 23. That means there's 23 open emails assigned to other people on the team. I can click in here and just work through them all in case something gets assigned to someone else, right? And then we have views.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Views. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Views is actually really interesting especially as you want to segment these more and the team gets bigger.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, here is like, I want to see all we're essentially saying, show me all conversations that. So here, it's like show me every conversation that's assigned or unassigned with the following statuses. And then with these dropped with, you know, these drop down fields, So, you know, it could be like show me all the emails of somebody that is working through install. And right then from here, I could click in, see this email I'm like actually working with like Nichelle, we're actually on the taping and kind of move that stage forward. Now, you know, that email is going to be removed from my view.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  But, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yep. And then finally, we do have a full analytics suite. So this… is just going to be able to show you how long it's taking us to respond to conversations, which is what we call our, we have workload and performance workload, how many conversations are open? How many came in during this period? How many are fully closed out? You can select the period from up here. And then, yeah, and then performance, like all the classic CX performance metrics, yeah, where it gets interesting is on the user level. So if we just scroll down here, I can drill into each user, see… all the work that they've done during this time period. It's like, okay, right. And I want to see the emails Rakesh has sent and that's all drillable.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay, cool. Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Now, just changing gears a little to the admin panel. This is how we're going to, you know, set up and manage everything. So we're going to go to shared inboxes and you're going to have your single shared inbox here or you have a demo as well, which you can delete. So I'm going to go to support. So here you've already set up this alias, but a couple things that are interesting. So, the custom fields that we talked about… this is the dropdowns. So could be a dropdown field, follow up date something else. And then finally, we have automations… and this is pretty interesting because we can do things like in this automation available on the growth plan, you know, if the sentiment, if a new email comes in and sentiment is updated and the AI sentiment is negative or very negative. We can automatically assign this email to a specific person and add an action tag.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Really just trying to create better visibility, right? We can also do things based on keywords. So if a new conversation is, you know, this is created, but it could be updated as.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Well,

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  contains any of the keywords in the subject or body add, you know, urgent tag and assign it to a certain person. So that's kind of, yeah, that's kind of how to think about this,

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay. This is interesting. Yeah, I'm going to give it a shot. I'll give it a try and yeah, if there's anything else I'll give you a shot.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Okay. I have one more really good piece of sure.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Sure. Cool. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  In the hiver settings, we have this instant chat support.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  A window popped out, but we have a technical support team that's available 24 seven, 365. They'll get back to you within like two to three minutes and if needed, they'll hop on a zoom.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay. Perfect.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I would say that's a pretty big differentiator compared to any other tool you're going to use in this space. Yeah… working in the space for 10 years and this is one of the best. This is the best technical support team I've ever worked with and they're just so customer centric. So there's my spiel.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Yeah. No, that's really helpful. Yeah, definitely. I mean, we don't want things slowing down.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  So, yeah, no, that's great. Yeah, I'm going to have a proper go at this and see how it's sort of blowing our day to day. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And when your trial ends within the admin panel to settings, you can manage your subscription. So we offer an annual subscription which is like 25 dollars per user per month paid annually. So it'd be 600 dollars, you know, for the year for two people. And we also offer a month to month agreement which is 35 dollars per user per month. No commitment. Just, you go through the trial. You're like, hey, this seems valuable plug in your credit card and you'll have full access, OK?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Yeah, that sounds good.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I'm jealous. Your project looks really cool in terms like I'm big on like I live in the north. I live just north of New York City, and, you know, OK, power costs here are pretty high.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Yeah. No, I can imagine. Yeah, I want to sort of get there ASAP, but it's still going to be a couple of years. There is actually a very cool startup which is working on something similar in New York. So, I hope they're able to launch soon.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Oh, yeah. What do you know what it's called?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  I actually forgot what it's called, but it's still a startup, so it's going to be at least a couple of years even for them to get out and sit in development phase. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, is your process like is the goal to sell to like developers or to like retrofit existing buildings at this time? Yeah.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  It's yeah, it's more B to B. So retrofitting is what we've designed this for. So it's like easy to retrofit new build. I mean, when you have the time to plan and when you can start from scratch, everything's doable. So, new build is not a big deal. But, yeah, retrofit is where the urgency and where the high demand is. So that's what we're targeting easy installation should be done in less than one hour, low sort of intrusion to tenants or users, homeowners, it should be in and out quickly and you should be able to heat cool, ventilate, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Is it, is it similar to like a mini split system? Because I saw that there was nothing you didn't mount anything exterior. It was just like a vent. Yeah.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  There's there's just a vent there's like sort of two circles that went through the wall. There's nothing on the outside. So mini split, I think like it's more of a package terminal system… not, they're not super popular, but you might have seen somewhere where it's like a big thick system. On the inside. Nothing on the outside you need to drill like large holes. Our holes are much tinier. Our inside system is a lot more prettier and we use a completely different technology. So less noise lighter as well. Yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I feel like I've seen systems similar in Los Angeles like the old.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  La.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Heating systems is like a kind of like a big brick on the wall but not very pretty brick.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  But, yeah, yeah, definitely intelligent. Well, yeah, let us know how we can support you absolutely if you need any help setting up. Like I can help a little bit. Oh, sorry. There's one last thing. Yeah. So you're going to reply to these emails, and would you rather the reply come from info at or from your email address?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  From my email address?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Okay. So it's currently set up to do that? Okay? But, if you want your associate to have a different setting.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Yeah, right.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, when you add them to the account?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  An email is going to come to the shared inbox that's like automated from Google saying, like, do you want this account to be able to send from this alias?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, you know, you accept and then you want to toggle this thing right here when replying to a message. Oh, it replied from the same address versus you default email. Okay? And then you just want to set up a signature because you could still have like the info at reply but put in your custom signature. Yeah.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Fair enough. Makes sense. So, right now, as a sort of default mode, it's been set up to send from my email, right? So, even if I'm sharing it with my associate, it's still going to send it from my email. If he sends an email, it's still going to be going from my email.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It would go from his email. If he has his own Google login.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  If I've shared this with him, it will go from his email.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because you shared, yeah, because he has his own Google address, right?

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Yeah. Okay. This is, yeah, this was that one question I would ask you. So there's no way that I can share specific emails and he's still able to reply as if it's replying from my email.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  No. Okay. You could create a signature for him strictly assigned to, you know, this alias, You know? Yeah. Okay. And have it be like, yeah, that would be the kind of workaround.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Okay. Got it. Okay. That helps. Cool. Yeah, this was really helpful. Thank you so much, krumm.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Oh, thank you so much. Thanks for your time. I wish you the best on your project. It's really cool. Ah.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Thank you so much. Yeah, the tool that you guys have made is also seems quite cool and, quite fresh. I love the design of it. So. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Thanks. Thank you. Talk to you later take.

Dhruv Shah (dhruv.shah@anzenwalls.co.uk):
  Care. Cheers bye.
