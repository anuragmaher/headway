Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Dylan. This is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Hey, matt, I can, how are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good. How are you doing?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, appreciate you joining here. Let me just see here. Great. And then I'm just trying to figure out here. How did you schedule this meeting again? Was it through us reaching out to you? Did you come to us?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  No, it was actually a LinkedIn ad. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Got it. Okay. Perfect. Well, appreciate you joining here. So the agenda for the call today, wanted to just spend the first couple minutes or so, maybe learning a bit more about you, maybe anything that's top of mind as to, you know, anything of interest that decided you to take this meeting and don't worry, I don't expect you to know much about hiver. If you do that's, great if not, no problem. And then from there, I can tell you a bit about our company and then walk you through the product and answer any questions you have. Sound good?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Sounds great. Awesome. So, first of all, for an intro, I am the director of technical support for the company in the cannabis space, saw.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  that.

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  sweed, POS, we offer full stack tech solutions for retailers and cannabis all over the country. And currently, we utilize an AI solution natively through intercom, which is our standard help desk. And this… is a fairly new trial that we've had some degree of success with for like six months. But, yeah, always looking for additional options out there in the ecosystem in this space. And it sounds like that's what hiver offers?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. Yep. We bring people over from intercom quite frequently. Are you a Google suite company, Microsoft suite company?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Google?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. And, you know… top of mind here. Anything top of mind about how you're using intercom that you wish could be improved or what you wish was different or better or anything?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  You know, I don't have any major qualms, I think it's solid functionality and the metrics we're seeing are decent, but again, always looking for alternatives out there and, you know, can always be improved on. I know this is a very new solution and a new space. So there's always improvements possible.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Absolutely. Awesome. I'm just gonna go ahead and.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Share my screen here. So just a quick intro about hiver. So we've been around since 2017 here. Helpdesk. AI platform. We have over 200 employees in over 50 countries. We have over 2000 customers ranging from small businesses, to some of the largest companies in the world, companies like capital one, openai, flexport, samsara, just to name a few. And one of the main areas that we help with, we do chat as well, which I'm assuming you're using intercom for chat?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Correct.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Do you have email support, email as well that you're using?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  We do, those are our two primary channels, but to be quite honest, it's primarily… chat. It's probably 95 percent of our volume.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Awesome. So let me go in here. So basically, I'll share my screen here. Can you see my screen? Yep? Awesome. So one of the big differences between hiver and some of these other platforms out there is that we're actually a certified Google partner. So you simply download the hiver extension and you're just going to get this extension within your Gmail. Okay? So you're no longer going to have to go hop onto separate applications or conveniently in your email here. So you can answer your personal emails just like normal. Except now on the left here, you're going to have these yellow icons which is easy access to both the email channels and the chat channels that you have. So the email channels would be here. So how it works is the emails come into the channel. We have various AI features which can let you know the sentiment of the email. The AI can categorize these emails, tag them, and can also assign them to the right person on your team, right? So that's all automated there. You get full visibility into these emails. You can see the statuses, open pending, closed. You can easily see all the open emails across the team who's working on them. So in the support email, we have 23 emails. Cole has six. I have two. I can see which ones are late. So you can set up slas which will notify you on which emails are late. And you can see all the back and forwards and the statuses when the email came in, questions that they had, et cetera. Additionally, we have an AI co pilot which can actually draft replies for you. So it learns from the emails that you've gotten it's. Going to ask you a three prompt question. You choose the prompt you want. And it can also reference documents, urls, notion articles, et cetera. To just provide those kind of contextual answers. Okay. I know you don't have much email like you said there, but it is a big part of hiver so just wanted to quickly show you that any questions or thoughts about how hiver handles those kind of shared email addresses you have?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  None at this time? Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. And then down here is the chat feature. So quite similar to how the email functions, is the chats are connected to your site. The chats come in here. You could set up different web flows. And based on those flows, it can get sent to a real agent here. And then within the next few weeks here, we're going to have the ability for it to do the AI automated responses as well. So that's coming out in the next couple of weeks here with the AI automated responses. So, yep, goes on your site, different statuses, you can assign it to each other, et cetera. Yep, categorize them easily see them all down here as well.

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. I think I was misunderstanding coming to this meeting, assumed that was the functionality primary functionality you guys offered.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yep. So hiver's positioning is that, I mean chat is a big part of it, but yeah, our primary offer capabilities right now is really around shared email.

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But our chat is catching up. Like I said, we're going to have the ability for AI to… handle these chats as well within the next couple of weeks.

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Okay. Matt. So one question on functionality is currently, our integration through intercom is such that we have just a widget in our back office for administrative staff to chat in with our team from… what would that flow look like with hiver?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Can you ask the question one more time?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Yeah. So the primary pathway for chat submission for our users right now is when they're logged in as users to the back office?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  They.

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  have an intercom hosted widget that they can submit chats through? How would that work with hiver?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So ours works predominantly on a website URL.

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So it would look something like this?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Okay. That actually looks really similar. And is it just this form or is there different iterations like our widget right now actually looks really similar with intercom, but beyond just the basic submission like that, there's also access to the knowledge base for faqs, and there's ticketing… reference for existing chats. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, ours, so we have a knowledge base as well. But yeah, at this point right now, ours is a bit more simple. When it comes to the chat, I believe you can make a little bit of changes to it with as far as the widget goes,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So you can make different changes to the widget here. You can include different help articles in the chat as well, like you were saying the knowledge base?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  This is the code that you can put on your website here, set up auto assignments.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it, I appreciate your time today.

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Yeah, likewise. Yeah. I think it's an appealing solution. I think if we were more email based, it might be a better option for us. But based on the limited chat functionality and the fact that we are primarily chat based right now, not a good solution for us, but happy to keep an eye on hiver's progress in the future. Definitely could be a competitor. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Definitely, definitely. Yeah. And our chat features, you know, really on our roadmap right now, as far as getting a lot of improvements and things, you know, we're kind of the opposite of intercom where we're predominantly email and then we rolled out chat. So we got to catch chat up to some of our customers' needs here. But, yeah, I mean, ideally, you know, within the next six months or so, it's to have the chat be quite as powerful as our email. And then the positioning for hiver is, you know, it's a system that offers you both email and chat all conveniently in one place, fairly easy to use, set up and 24 seven support et cetera.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But, yeah, Dylan really appreciate everything. I'll make sure everything gets to you. I'm going to email you kind of recap after this, you were promised a gift card on LinkedIn, right?

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Correct. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So, yeah. So that will get situated that might take up to a week to get it's. Going to come to your email via giftagram. It's called.

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Okay. All right. I'll keep an eye out.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Thanks so much, Dylan. You have a good one.

Dillon Caldwell (d.caldwell@sweedpos.com):
  Thanks, matt. See.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You. Thanks bye.
