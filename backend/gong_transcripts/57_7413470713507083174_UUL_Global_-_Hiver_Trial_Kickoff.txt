================================================================================
Call: UUL Global - Hiver Trial Kickoff
Date: 2026-01-28T21:00:32+05:30
================================================================================

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  how's it going? It's.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  going well. How are you, josh?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  I'm okay. We're just waiting on Amy to pop in here. Amy is our north American ops manager… and she has direct oversight over the whole operations team. And so, it will be useful to get her opinion as to what y'all got going on. Perfect.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And out of curiosity, how did you start uul?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  What's that, how did I start here? Yeah. There was a group of us that had worked together at another location… five or well, really, I guess at this point, now, it's five years ago in the late twenties, we all worked together at another logistics company. Some of us went our separate ways. That company kind of changed quite a lot. And so, the former president that we had here, you know, called me up in late 20 23 and was like, hey, you know, we're working on this uul project. You know, we're trying to establish them in the United States, you want in. And I had a pretty good working relationship with them and her team. And so I was like, let's do it, let's make it happen. So that's… how I ended up here. Obviously, we've had quite a big change over the last two months or so, with private equity investment and some of our other colleagues moving on. So now, it's like working for a different company. So, yeah, I.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  was kind of curious what that felt like just in terms of like where it's going now with like PE money.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  I don't know, you know, they're obviously very tech forward, which is good. You know, you don't I mean, maybe you do, but I don't see a ton of that through the partners that I utilize right now. And so, I think it's good to get ahead of that. And it's a pretty good marriage I think because these guys, I think Jerry was on the last call and yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  He was some.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Of some of his colleagues, you know, they know the tech side, and then obviously, we know the logistics side.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  And so, it's kind of a matter of us both helping each other out and… getting to where we need to go. Hang on. I got a message from Amy here. She says, I'm… for sure.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  How about you? Where, where are you based?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I'm based in New York?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. Like the city, or like, yeah, okay. Are you from New York or you, are you a new yorker?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I guess I'm a new yorker. I've I grew up in Massachusetts, just south of Boston.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Oh, okay. But,

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I've been in New York for 10 years. So are.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  you a, are you a Boston sports fan?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I am. Yeah. I grew up in the golden age.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Yeah, I've got a, one of my, one of my best friends down here is from Boston and, he's a fan of all the sports but especially the patriots and he used to torment me, you know, back during y'all's, like crazy run. I mean, for what? 20 years, and I got so sick of it. And then it's been nice for the past like four or five years. You know, I haven't heard a lot out of him. You know, I'm a, I'm in North Carolina. So, I'm a panthers fan, unfortunately, and we've both kind of been bad. And now, you know, y'all, are off to the super bowl and he's back on his horse again. And, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Haven't,

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  y'all, had enough success, you know?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's kind of a wild ride because, you know, we're sitting here going back to the super bowl and like we're excited, but we're like something doesn't quite feel right? I.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Don't know, it's been a weird football year. It's been really weird. I do have some, I do have a soft spot for the.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Red sox. I was always a big baseball fan growing up and trott, nixon was like from an area where my grandparents were, they're like friends with his family and all that. So that, what was it? Four or three? Whatever run where they broke, the chain. I was like deeply invested. Yeah, I.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  think that was three four.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. So, Amy just texted me. She said I was trying to join, but it's not working join from zoom meeting app. Would you be able to forward her? Is there like a link that she can use to get into this? Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  There is.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Okay. I just emailed her a link.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  So, while we wait on her, I'll go ahead and start, I guess talking a little bit. We are, we converted to Gmail this week which is a, you know, quite a big switch from outlook and… no one's really a fan at this point. I don't think it's because Gmail, you know, sucks. I think it's because we're just used to using outlook the last, well, I mean, two years here and probably longer for everybody else. So we're getting used to, the setup with Gmail and all that. So, I'm very curious as to how y'all's, program is going to fit into this and like what it can fix. I actually was on the call last week. I heard Jerry keep talking about, you know, the ops Guy and I was like, who is he talking about? And then he messaged me after he's like, yeah, we just had the call with hiver and I was like, yeah, dude, I was on it. What do you mean? So I did see your initial tutorial, yes or last week, perfect?

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  What?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Is going on? Amy? What are we doing? She's typing something out to me. Let's see.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  She doesn't have zoom involved, I mean installed.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. While she navigates through that, you and I can kind of kick off what is going to be the easiest thing for you? Like should I show you my screen and kind of like how we do stuff or what would be, how do you want to do this call? I guess, yeah one.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sec, Alex, hi, josh. My name is Jeevan. I currently lead the sales team here at hiver. I wanted to jump on. I've been following along with Alex and I wanted to be an additional resource. I've been with a business… for over seven years now and I've worked with a lot of our companies specifically in CPL and logistics and trucking, and specifically in that space helping them transition over. So, very familiar with the model and what that might require. So given that we're in the process of getting started with a more in depth evaluation, I wanted to be part of this conversation. So I want to address two pieces one, you asked about what hiver does on top of Gmail. Of course, I'm sure your team hates it at this point coming out of outlook. What we're trying to do is sort of level zero plug a few of these sort of collaboration gaps that Gmail inherently comes with. And number two, just give your team a system that is inbuilt in their platform. Right now. You've just moved from outlook to Gmail. We don't want you to go to yet another software. So within your current move, can we offer tools and systems that can make your team's life easier? And more often than not add a lot of clarity? So that's what we're trying to do. And in terms of how best to handle this call, typically, we do offer sort of what we call a guided trial where we'll help you get started with an account… invite people if you want to add one of your sort of low volume shared environments that's great. If not, we give you a test environment to play out of.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And once we get everyone good confident and know what they're doing in there, then we can talk about bringing in some actual real volume so that your team can test it out.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. Awesome.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Hi, everyone. Good morning.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  It's.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  the logging, it's difficult.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'm glad we got you on here. Thanks for jumping on. So josh, if you want to start, I mean we definitely can, you can just get… you can share your screen. We can walk you through the process and then you can invite other members and then we can explore pieces as we go.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  All right. Let's do that… share my screen?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  All right. Can you all see what I'm looking at here? Yes. Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yep. Sounds good. This.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Is my personal mailbox, right? And then this… is our basically… our north American operations mailbox. So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's like operations go at uulglobal. Com.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Operations gso. So, we are in Greensboro, North Carolina. And like a code is gso for that?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sorry, I read that wrong. That's okay. All right. So, you.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  can see that there's quite a lot of volume sure.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We like volume this.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Is, so we just converted as of Monday and we got a couple in here as of the 20 seventh and then the rest of these are from this morning. Now, you can see that there are conversations… with, you know, individual people. So, Ella, for example, is one of Amy's ops people and she's got in copy, you know, the operations gso mailbox which is what we're in right now and she is corresponding with pageline… which is our truckload brokerage arm. And then you've got another one up here which is Noah communicating with one of our agents. I think this is an agent from the Dominican Republic. And so I… guess like these have, these are like chains right now. So you see like this is like nine emails involving this one back and forth and what we're trying to like prevent are, you know, missed emails but also like clutter in one's box. So ideally when somebody is looking at this mailbox, so Amy is our operations manager, for example, when she looks at this, I want her to be able to know like what is being addressed and what is not being addressed… additionally into this mailbox. I don't see any right now, but we get a fair bit of like arrival notices, invoices, you know, kind of important one off documents here or there that we like really don't want to miss. And like once they come in, we need somebody to address it immediately. And that can be a little bit difficult to like find when, I mean we're already at 10 45 and you've got like a bunch of email chains here to kind of navigate through and see what's handling additionally when something like this ends up in somebody's mailbox. So I'm not like coordinating shipments myself. But, you know, Amy can show us her mailbox, you know, I've got a lot of emails here. I've got a weird filing system to kind of keep track of stuff and to see what's important for me. But in someone like Amy's mailbox, she's going to have a lot of emails to navigate through just like her staff is. And I want them to be able to kind of like parse and see what's what, right? So, it's 10 45. I've got like 13 emails here involving one random truck shipment, but I've also got like a really hot ocean freight email that I need to address, but I don't know, I need to address it yet because I'm going through so many truck shipment emails. I don't know if this is like making sense, but y'all, tell me if it's so.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Much, so much, there's so much we can do here. Josh. I think the reason why we've had so much success with CPL, and just generally this model in the past is because one thing we've seen this whole so many people in CC, so many people in the, so, one of the first most like low hanging fruits that we sort of like help you eliminate is the need to have so many people on CC all the time. So, anyone who is a part of hiver who is a participant of the shared environment that we're going to create connected to the operations gso email address, do not need to be cc'd on any email sent or sent to or from that mailbox, right? So what we do is ensure that visibility is the first thing we bring to the table. If an email is part of operations gso, which is a shared environment that we'll create it'll, be a separate folder over there on the left part of your main inbox. If you are a part of hiver and you are a participant of that environment, you no longer have to be cc'd to be brought into that picture. Because you go into that folder, you'll see all the emails that are part of that. And you can start picking this up. Now, two, one of the biggest areas where hiver really helps you is josh, like you said, if you're getting such a high volume of emails, but there are certain emails as they come in, they're of higher priority. What are platform does? Is it before a human being even gets to an email, our AI runs it, right? Our AI runs it and it can look out for specific items in that email. So we've got AI tasks where what it does is essentially say, hey, if an email comes in and it is about a specific high priority request, you can automatically assign a priority. You can automatically send an email back. You can automatically bring people's attention to it so that it is brought. Even if you're looking at 50 emails, it is brought right to the top so that it gets your attention first before you move on to the rest, right? So just a couple of ideas right off the bat based on what you just said, but there's so much that.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  We can do.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  How does the process begin with y'all, if we wanted to kind… of what I just did, which is a major super broad overview. And Amy probably is going to have more context because she's the one who's literally managing these people. But how… does it begin? Do we work with somebody like an engineer? Like one of y'all, and y'all, kind of like we start with baby steps and say, okay, first we're going to do this, we're going to see how that goes and then we're going to move on to the next step. Like, I guess it's hard for me and maybe I'm a little overwhelmed because the Gmail thing is kind of throwing me off, but maybe I'm making it more. Maybe it's more complicated in my head than it is in real life. Does that make sense?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it's very valid, right? You've been through such a massive change. It's like literally changing. I compare it to changing houses, right? It's such a big change for a business. So, I get it. And I've seen this hundreds and hundreds of times. So we know what that goes into one of the biggest things is you're not going to be able to drag and drop as much as you did in Microsoft, right? So I get it from a process perspective. First thing, what we'd like to learn about josh is like, what are your top three or four priorities with this, right? What are your top areas where you think that the team might need help? Whether you think that the team is doing additional effort to get stuff done? We'd like to learn about those items. Then we go about actually helping you implement it. So you're absolutely, right? You will get a dedicated resource from our team to help you get started… 100 percent. And even during the trial period, we'll make sure that you've got a resource as well as our 24 seven support team to answer questions to make sure that you and whoever else is part of that early pilot feels comfortable in what they're doing. Okay?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Amy… do you have any initial questions about this? I, you know, we didn't talk about this.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  This meeting just specifically for Gmail, right? Email, not for Google, right? Because we are going to call Google account. It's not just Gmail including excel word, right?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  No. So, this is kind of like just a email organization.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. Just email. Okay. Yeah.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  And so, you weren't a part of the initial… I don't know what you would like tutorial last week that Alex kind of ran for Jerry, Jason and I. But, the idea being that this is a, I don't know how you guys would describe it perhaps like an email organization tool that fits with Gmail? Does that make sense? Is that like how you all would describe fiber sort?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Of, yeah, Amy, I would think about it as, so we have like a Chrome extension that is going to augment the Gmail inbox and bring together all of those other aliases. So you have your normal Gmail that you log into. And then we have operations at and kind of all of these other subfolders, we're going to be able to bring that all together in one place, have assignment of the emails. So you never have to worry about, you know, who owns this. Like are we missing an email, being able to do priorities and kind of auto routing based on tags and keywords? And then we have some various AI overlays just to make the team faster. So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Essentially, what we're trying to do is give you a simple system to organize your inboxes, all of your shared environments, AI, to help you speed up those processes. Anything that we can automate with AI, we'll try to do. We've got a bunch of workflows that you can set up. So essentially, as many manual effort steps that you take with your team, as many of that we can eliminate as much of that, we can put a system around that's what the system does?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  That.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  means the Gmail, we're going to customize the based on the user requirement, right? So, what are we currently use that impasse to start Monday? It's been few three days, so it's been used, the Gmail spread the three days, right? So this email is just to not customize yet, right? Just normal. Regular. Is that correct? I go, you are going to customize those email management with for us, right? Yes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yes. Okay.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. So… yeah, I just used Gmail. Three days. I never used Gmail before. I mean, in your company before, not very familiar with how this work.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  And what are these three days that I used? I've run a little question. I don't know if you can share with, you can say something. This is just a small question, but, I, because I didn't know that much Gmail. So, I couldn't be able to ask that big question, but just a small question. Let me share the screen.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hopefully.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Share a screen with this one, my God.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Josh, but you might have to stop for a second.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  I thought I saw a share screen. Okay? Send the request. Yeah.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Guys, I should preface this and apologize because we've had kind of a chaotic week with the switch to Gmail. And here in, North Carolina, at least we had like a snow slash ice storm. So it's been not the best place for like learning new technology in the middle. So I apologize for kind of the lack of preview that's.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  okay. Okay. Can you see my email? I'm sharing the, my emails?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yes. Okay. A.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  New question is one of like, for example, this email there's, number is nine, which means they have linked with nine initial and the email link, right? And when I go here, is that possible? We can go to the first one on the top and last one, the old one try, I tried to go to the setting, but I couldn't figure out, yeah.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  That's.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  actually a really valid point. Amy, so with Gmail by default as.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  I understand. It's supposed to be when I click any email, the earliest one is supposed to on the top, right?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, for Gmail.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  It looks like the earliest one is on the very bottom. I have to go through all the bottom to get the earliest one and then the newest one and then the oldest one put on the very top so it can sometimes confuse us at the first sign when I open the email.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So by default, Google worldwide puts the first email first and then the second email at the bottom and then so on and so forth. So you'll always have to scroll down to find the latest email. It's been a constant piece of feedback from our customers. So we've actually built an alternate version where we bring this to the top. But, yeah.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. So this is what the design for the first, the earliest one is the… bottom of the, and the oldest one in the top, right? Is what we designed.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  This one might be a question for you all. So one of the things that Gmail does is it will box… all of your emails into one conversation. And I don't love that. So I've turned that off on my personal mailbox with your, with the hiver product. Is that something that you would recommend be turned on? Or is it better? Yes, yes, turn it on for hiver. I'll tell.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  you why? So part of the hiver from a hiver experience, right? So for example, an email comes into operations jso, and it gets assigned to one person and they start working on it, and then maybe that conversation keeps going and the next day they've called in sick or they're just not in the office and someone else needs to step in and take that conversation over so that continuity is only possible for that second person to step in and take over if they're able to see all of the earlier messages in that thread in one place. So it is required. It's actually a requirement and it's actually the only requirement that we need for it to be switched on just so that we can offer their continuity. And that's the only way for us to do so.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Now, last week, we talked about the assigning, I guess, and I didn't really quite understand it at that time. But an email comes into operations jso. Let's say that it's from our pricing team. They have a booking confirmation from the customer. So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Pricing.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Sends it to operations jso and copies Amy and they say, hey, Amy, please assign this to the ops team. Here are the details?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yes, at.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  That point, Amy will need to physically assign a new chain to in hiver or something. Is that how that works?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yes. So either Amy can physically manually assign it or of course, there's a bunch of automation steps that you can set up where it can be done automatically because nobody likes manual effort that much, but by default, yes, you have the ability to literally open that email, read it. Next to it. There's a side panel which belongs to that specific email and you can assign it to that person.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. Now, if we have particular ops people that are handling specific customers, right? Let's say, atlantic… packaging, right? Atlantic packaging is handled by one individual and always will be unless she's sick or out or whatever. Sure, is there an automation that we get a new atlantic packaging booking? And then that automatically gets assigned to the specific ops individual?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  100 percent, where would that the fact that atlantic booking, where would that be mentioned in the email? Would it be in the subject in the body? Somewhere? Where would that be?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Like who the customer is? Yes?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Like the name of the customer. So we can either.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  They would be in the email chain. You know, it may be in an email chain where atlantic packaging has told pricing to proceed or pricing in sending their booking confirmation to ops might say, please see new booking for atlantic packaging.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So essentially, when, so in that chain, josh, when does that chain come into operations gso? Upon booking? Yeah. So at the time of when an operations gso is included in that thread that's when it first comes into that mailbox, that's when it first comes into hiver. So, at the first point of entry, our AI and our automation workflows run through that email and we process it. If we set up a rule that says, hey, if an email has atlantic bookings in that subject line or in that body or somewhere in the email, automatically assign it to this person. So if you've got that rule set up and enabled as it comes into the mailbox for the first time, it will get processed and it will automatically get assigned.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. And then, how about those? I say automated? Because they usually come from like a robot. But when a steamship line will send an arrival notice or an invoice or something like, that only goes to the gso operations.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  I guess, will that be Amy's responsibility to assign? Or how will that work? Because the reason I ask is because I don't want Amy just going through the ops mailbox assigning things to people all day, sure.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. The idea is josh for us to get to a space where we're assigning majority of your emails automatically. Now, what that percentage is. We can figure out typically that's about 70 to 80 percent with our clients and the remaining 20 percent, the outliers that actually need, hey, okay. Let's figure this out or what this is and where it needs to go to the outliers. Is what we'd want Amy to process and assign herself outside of that, we want it to be majority automated so that it goes to the right person, they start replying. All the replies are kept in part of the shared environment. So, Amy, even if Amy is not cc'd on them, she still gets access to those replies so she can come supervise review… offer feedback, fix stuff if required. So even though she's not cc'd she still has access, so she can do all of these things. But the idea is that we don't want to clutter up everyone's inbox with 100 emails. We want them to focus on only the emails that they need. But when they do need to go and find other emails and review them, it makes it very easy for them to do that. Just because they might need to review them at one point every week, it doesn't need to clutter up their entire inbox. So that's the principle.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. So, will the system, let's say something hasn't been addressed, right? Let's say that there's an email that comes in at three PM on a Monday. And now it's Wednesday morning and it hasn't been assigned or handled or anything? Is there like a way for the system to notify and be like, hey, this one hasn't been addressed?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So we call them slas internally so you can set up rules that say, hey, if an email comes in, it has to get responded to within let's say four hours of coming in. If that's too long. Like typically, our, for example, our SLA internally is one hour. So we need to respond within one hour of an email coming in. And if that doesn't happen, we can literally set an alarm off and notify Amy yourself and anyone else in the business as required. But, yeah.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. Now, ops… mailbox, I kind of, I'm still going to need to see it in practice, but ops mailbox, I feel like I can kind of conceptualize that. Now, when we get to the individual's personal mailbox, we can look at Amy's Amy, if you could minimize that email that you have right now. So she has you're… doing a good job with your, main inbox, Amy, with only 10 unread messages. But if you can see through like her folder setup, we've got a lot of like various folders with lots of unread emails. And, you know, a lot of that is because they're not shipments that she's like directly handling herself.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  But for.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  her, and for anybody else in operations… how does email management with like folders? How do you all integrate that? Because like what I don't want someday is for Amy to have to go into her archive email right now, she's got 270 unread emails in that folder. Like if I have Amy spending all day or two days going through all 270 of those emails, she's not going to be moving freight, right? Or managing the ops team. How is that optimized with hiver?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So first things first, by default, right? Josh, for us, what we want to do is we want to eliminate the clutter in your inbox. So, the 270 emails in our archive, Amy, were those addressed to operations gso and got Amy in CC?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  A lot of them probably were, yeah, right? So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  If an email is sent to operations gso and has got Amy in CC, we can set up a filter to automatically remove those from our inbox. Right now. I'll go one step further. Josh. What if I were to ask you, why is the team sending an email to operations gso and ccing Amy on the same thread, what is that? And why does that happen? I assume that happens because they want her to have to get attention to it and without having to constantly check two different inboxes, is that right?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  I'm not really sure. I think.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  That's going to increase my volume very significantly.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Right. What was that? If?

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  All the group email put me on CC as the super one? I'm not going to be, I was buried on all the emails every day.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Yeah. I don't really know why. I mean myself, I'm in copy of a lot of probably the majority of those emails as well. And so like for me and I'm not, you know, managing this group on kind of a day to day but I've got hundreds of ops emails every day too that I've got to filter through. I mean, a lot of our sales team is in copy of these things as well. And so I do have like rules set up. I had rules in outlook and now I'm like making new rules or the equivalent of rules in Gmail. But I still have to go through those emails at some point because I don't know if someone's saying, hey, josh, can you advise on this? And that happens a lot where I'll have something populate into a separate folder. So it's not in my main inbox.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And then someone might need your help there, absolutely, right? I get it. So that's the piece that we're trying to get to josh. What we want to do is get to a space where your inbox only has emails directly addressed to you.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It's sort of like only has private information now. Like Amy said, the reason why she is cc'd or you are cc'd on these emails is because they want your eyes on it, but they are being sent to operations as well. So think about a scenario where your inbox at the top only gets your private emails. None of the other cc'd stuff. Now, there are two ways in which we can have that set up. One is hiver, actually automatically creates a filter to keep your inbox clean without those emails where you're cc'd where they also go to the shared inbox, or you can even ask your team to stop doing that. But if that's too much of a lift, we don't have to bother. There's no harm done. The reason why I'm saying there's no harm done is because instead of them cluttering up each individual inbox which are all discrete locations where they're not talking to each other. What if each of you had in the same window in your inbox below the inbox, start snooze, send buttons on the left. You get a separate folder called operations gso. All of the information lives in that folder. That folder has common access to everybody on your team. So if there, if you're assigned something, there is a separate mind section where you only see stuff that you are assigned. And best part is if 30 messages into a thread, if someone says josh, can you advise the person who was assigned to that email if they need to get your attention, instead of you finding that out by looking through 20 emails, they can actually leave you an internal note on the right. Saying add josh, you need your attention here. You actually get a notification to your desktop and your phone saying that in this specific email, you need your attention and that can, and you can step in there.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  And pick it up? Yeah, that would be super useful for myself and probably Amy, I mean, who's in copy of a lot of this because you know, various issues require different advice from somebody if we could… I guess put what needs addressing in our faces then that helps. That saves me a ton of time. That saves Amy a ton of time.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And anybody?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Else who's in copy of these? I don't I would definitely love to get to the point of where our.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  ops team.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Or anybody for that matter is not including like everybody at the company and every email. But old habits die hard. And so I think the filter kind of sending that stuff out of your main inbox is probably the move until people get used to not copying everybody on every email. Amy, is that making sense to you? What Jeevan just described?

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Sorry, I didn't clear what the point, is that group email… talking about group email, that beside the inbox?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  So, the idea being is that you are in copy of a lot of emails that you're not necessarily directly involved with, right? There may be an email chain that has 75 emails that are on a shipment that Ella is coordinating and you are not involved in any of those, but you still receive those emails into your main inbox. And so if you are like me, you're spending a lot of time filtering your main inbox trying to find what is relevant to you. Does that make sense?

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Yeah. But the point is that what was put on the emails, they put my email address as a CC, right? So I can just view the email, but I typically, I'm not involving this shipment to, unless they need me help with the system, right? Yeah. So the,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  idea is, I mean in those cases, your inbox is not being cluttered with everything. You have a separate folder with hiver where you can access all the emails, but you're not being just seeing everything in one place, we're organizing it in different sort of sub folders so that you can know exactly what you're going towards. And in any one of these conversations where your attention is required at a later point, hiver can automatically come in and help your team actually at mention you like you do on social media so that you get notified and you can come to that specific email where attention is required and you can address it.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Yeah. This is what I put. They put my name on the attention as attention. Yes, we're taking. But other than that, right? I don't have to.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Is that correct? That's.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  the idea? Yes. Yeah.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  So, I can't I can, I'm getting a better idea of how this would help. I think what I'm going to do and I should have done this last week but it's been kind of crazy is Amy, there's a pretty good YouTube video about hiver y'all. Might have another one that you recommend that's like super, but I did find one that was pretty solid. And Amy, I'll send you that so that you can kind of see it in practice. But for Alex and Jeevan, what can, what do we need to give to you all to sort of like get the ball rolling slowly on this? One of you mentioned earlier that like the top three issues that we have currently that we think that you all could assist with, would something like that help kind of like begin the process or, what do you need from Amy and I, so.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  The setup process itself is fairly simple just we're gonna, we can help you set up. Even right now, we'll probably need about 20 30 minutes with the both of y'all, out of which the first five minutes we'll say we'll set up, we'll actually spend setting up, your hiver instance because it's very plug and play super straightforward you want to be up and running in times from that point on. What this means is that you've got an actual live hiver instance connected to your accounts. And then we can sort of go phase by phase in terms of what we want to connect, what we want to tackle. And we're not going to do a heavy lift. All at once. We can do very incremental steps towards sort of where we want to get to. And that's what we, that's what I'd recommend.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  And so I probably don't want to do that today because we're still trying to like learn Gmail. So maybe next week would be a good time for that. Is, is your recommendation that you would have like maybe Amy and I do this first, and then like add the other team members or is it better to have anybody who this is going to be used for, to be involved from the onset?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'd recommend you us and Amy and y'all set up first and get started and actually implement a couple of these steps and then get the team members involved because what that helps us do, josh is also like get a real for me and Alex to get a real understanding of exactly how this might be used. And then before adding the team members, we can actually do a quick session with them so that they don't feel like they're being thrown into the deep end, they've already in the deep end with Google and as a new tool, but we can give them like a really simple easy sort of sop to follow on, what they can do and what they can get out of this. So that's typically like where we want to go. Okay?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  All right. Who would I liaise with to get that first part arranged sometime next week, maybe next Wednesday or something? Alex?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Is your point of contact? I'll be around for this evaluation as well so he can coordinate schedules. Alex, I'm only not available second half of next week on a particular day on Thursday, but apart, I'm okay with that great all.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Right. So, Amy, I'm gonna send you that video guys. I think we ought to plan for maybe next Wednesday to give us a little bit more time with Gmail to kind of find our way around that. And then we'll start with Amy and I next week probably next Wednesday again, I think would be good.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Wednesday from start from 11, it's the 30 10 30 because then Wednesday at 10 o'clock we have a meeting with Atlanta take, okay?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Wednesday 11 would be better for you, Amy?

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Better. Can you?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  All go ahead and set that for 11 a M, next Wednesday, Eastern Time? Yep. All right.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  And also, I, we need to talk the discuss how manage, the group email. It's very important for us to that's.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  what we specialize in is the group email. So… I think once we install the extension.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  It'll.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  be a lot easier to like see exactly how this can move and especially for you, Amy, when you're like assigning work to people through the group email domain that's and that have full visibility in terms of what people are doing.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Yeah, I thought.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  That we can use the group email to send the email out, yes?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you have options there?

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Yeah… we.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  could send from the group email and then have either the individual's signature. So you could still have, you know, Amy signature.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  I set up the signature on the group email. You put my name and somebody else. Other people send the group email out. They're gonna pop out to my name or her name.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Her.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Name. So it would be whoever the sender is. You can configure it that way. So it still feels more one to one but it's still going into the shared domain. It.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Depends. It completely depends on how you all want to set it up. If you want to send emails with the group email address, but your signature, you can, if you want to send the group email address with the generic team signature, you can completely.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Up to you. What do you, what do you all find a lot of your clients are doing? I mean, because, in my previous iterations, the group email is good for management, but I don't necessarily want people sending from that mailbox. It's more of like that mailbox in my opinion is more of a catch all and a database of everything that's happened in ops. So if something weird happens, I can go back and follow and see what happened. But I don't necessarily think it would be ideal for like coordinating shipments from that email address because that's what the ops people, you know, that's what their inbox is for, is that how it's handled with y'all's other freight forwarding clients?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. All other CPL clients specifically in operations where same exact setup, josh, where they get a purchase order or a proof of sale to operations team, they book the sale, they reach out to carriers, they book carriers, then they take care of all of it to completion standard process. We've seen 100 times like you're right? In those scenarios, we do have customers having using their own individual emails. We are completely okay. We support both scenarios equally because we also have a lot of customers in scenarios where like for example, accounting where someone's accounting teams are set up on hiver, where they have an accounts receivable at flexport, com, or accounts receivable accounts payable at flexport. Com. In those scenarios, they prefer to send and receive emails using the group email because they don't want to expose individual accounting reps. But in your case, it makes sense to send emails using individual emails and that's completely fine.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  So we haven't even discussed this yet because we've been hitting on operations the whole time, but I mean, it sounds like this could be good for shared accounting mailboxes too. Any.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Email address, which is a single point of intake where a bunch of people are behind that intake looking to manage it. I think we could help.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. I want to start with ops first and, you know, Amy and I will get our feet wet with it, and then we'll add on the other ops people too, but I think we should also look into it going forward with accounting as well. So that'll be, you know, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, but I think this would be useful for those mailboxes too.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  The reason why I brought up accounting specifically, like I said, flexport is one of our larger customers in this space, and they've got the pricing team talking to the ops team, talking to the billing team, talking to the accounting team all on hiver, all in connected environments. And we've actually got them set up in a way that they all talk to each other and they all flow. And because they're all connected, there's a lot of automation and information sharing that happens automatically. So, yeah, so.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Yeah. I mean, again, you're expanding my mind here because obviously we have a pricing group too. Can you describe to me in a way that… like we are looking at other tools like palette for example, is a company we're looking at for pricing, but like I'm not, you know, a tech Guy. So maybe I don't see the forest through the trees, but it would seem to make sense that instead of having palette or a third party, whomever it is, handle the thing for pricing. And then we move on to hiver for ops and eventually accounting. What is the way where hiver could like synchronize between pricing and ops?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, I would assume that the pricing team also has like a shared email address where they get requests for quotes. If I understand the model correctly, there's.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  a distribution list that we could convert to a separate mailbox.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It doesn't matter. We work exactly the same way with distribution lists as well. Okay. And I assume that's set up as a group. So that's completely fine. So if pricing gets an email to that distribution list requesting a quote, the same exact setup, you can connect that distribution list to a shared environment on hiver, add your pricing team in there, round Robin. It. So what a lot of our pricing teams do is they round Robin based on who's available at the time. So quotes don't wait, they get to individual people immediately. And then we give them templates of responses that they just need to fill out information. And then the templated response as a response to a quote can be sent out depending on whether they accept it. They push back a lot of back and forth. Whatever happens at the end of it, that email could essentially become a confirmation email. That confirmation email could get converted. Could just be you just loop in the support the operations team, then that thread gets goes to operations that they pick it up from there and they do what they need to do and then it can go to account. So it's sort of like a handoff between departments.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Cool. Again. Let's for us right now, we'll focus on the ops, but then, you know, with accounting and then eventually pricing is a possibility too. Although as I said, Jerry and Jason are looking at other companies for those too. So anyway, okay. I feel like I have a decent game plan for now… Alex, you want to send us that invitation for next Wednesday, I guess. And Amy, I'll send you a video and we will continue to move down this path.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. I have a last question and as Jeevan mentioned that group email function and individual email function are, very, similar, right? Like they can send an email can draft. They can also can, you know, individually a signature. So looks like the group email function is exactly same with the individual email function. Is that correct on the Gmail at least right now? At least? Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  For the most part, yes.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  So if we, okay… that's the function, is that duplicate?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No, it does not duplicate. So that's the great that's a great question. So if an email is sent to you as well as the shared inbox, if that shared inbox is connected to hiver, it doesn't mean that there's two different copies one in your inbox, one in your shared inbox, both are in the same place.

Amy.Zhong (amy.zhong@uulglobal.com):
  Okay. I need to get used to Gmail. We'll get.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Used to it, Amy, and then we'll talk with these guys next week, and get us set up on hiver, so we'll see how it improves our email management. Anyway. All right, guys. I appreciate y'all, taking some time with us this morning and, you know, we'll talk again next week, okay?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Thanks, see.

Josh Foster (jlfoster@uulglobal.com):
  Y'all, bye.
