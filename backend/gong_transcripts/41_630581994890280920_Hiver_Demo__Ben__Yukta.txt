Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Ben. How are you? You are Yukta? Yes, this is Yukta. How are you doing?

Ben:
  Sorry, I couldn't hear clearly.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you hear me now?

Ben:
  Yep, I can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. How are you doing?

Ben:
  Yep. I'm good. How about you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'm doing good as well. Thank you. Shall we get started?

Ben:
  Sure. No problem. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Thank you for scheduling this session with me. My name is Yukta and I'll be helping you with the evaluation today. So, as we get started, Ben, I would love to first understand in terms of, what is it that made you look out for a tool like hiver in the market, if you could explain me in terms of what exactly you're looking for and trying to solve? I think accordingly, I can tailor the demonstration for you.

Ben:
  Okay. Basically, I could say a scenario for you. Our company is actually having a share email share sales email address. So we have around approximately eight to 10 customer service who are using the same email to reply. Okay? And then we might facing some issues like one person read the message, but… and then, she read the message but didn't reply. And then the message already been read. So it's been enough, you know? And then we might having samples and two persons replying the same message, duplicating the message. And then, and then, yeah, basically having the share email. So might have some issues on that. Got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It got it. Yeah, I mean, these are some basic pain points that come in when everybody's logging into the same Gmail account. And then they are managing to answer or respond to these emails on a day to day basis. Yeah, I just want to confirm whether these eight to nine people. Do they have their individual accounts as well?

Ben:
  No, they have, they don't have, we are really everyone are sharing the same, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, in order for hiver to work and which email address is this? The sales email address? Is it procurement at the rate or some other email address?

Ben:
  A sales email? Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's sales at the rate E, steel suppliers. Yeah. Okay. So, got it. And could you also talk to me a little bit about your role? Like, are you part of this team or are you from a procurement team who is looking to find the right solution for the sales team?

Ben:
  Yep. I'm looking for the right solution for the same thing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Let you know about hiver and how it works. Let me just share my screen. So, in order for hiver to work and for us to be able to create the shared inbox, we would require individual logins of each person, right? Because hiver sits as you can see on my screen, I'm currently on my Gmail account, and hiver natively sits on your Gmail itself. That you can notice in these yellow colored icons. And in order for everyone to be able to access the shared inbox, which we will create with the sales email address, they would require their individual logins. For example, I'm currently logged into my Gmail account, which is up at the rate hiver. Healthtest. Com. This is my company domain, and I can access different shared mailboxes within hiver that are connected to the generic email addresses for each department. For example, finance is connected with finance at the rate help desk, healthcare is connected with that info is connected and support is connected. Likewise, we will create one shared inbox connected to your sales email address. And then we will add all the eight to 10 individuals who can access the shared inbox from their own respective Gmail accounts. So I would first want to understand, would you be okay to introduce workspace accounts for each individual? Because that will also come at an additional cost for you wherein you're introducing Gmail accounts for, you know, the sales team?

Ben:
  Actually, I will share emails under Google workspace, but I think if we are having everyone the email address, it might be a cost for us. It.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Will be a cost. And that is why I want to make sure that you're okay with it before, you know, invest your time in evaluating hiver because hiver will then have its own cost as well, right? So this is a separate cost that you will have to pay. And then you'll have to pay for each person's Google workspace account as well.

Ben:
  If you are using, the free account, is it possible? I mean the? Gmail?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, Gmail com will not work. Yeah, it has to be a company domain account. Yeah. So once you do that like, then everybody like the pain point that you're facing it will get resolved right there and then, and that is the only way to go about it as well, right? Once you introduce everyone's is there a reason why you don't have people's individual logins?

Ben:
  Because we are sharing the same email. So we have a, everyone can access to the same email to see everything?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And then they use the Gmail com for any personal communication with the company. Is it?

Ben:
  Currently, we are not using the Gmail. Com. So everyone.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  How do these employees communicate with? Let's say internally with HR, with other employees? How does the communication happen within the company?

Ben:
  What's that?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Whatsapp? Okay. I was just curious. Okay. So, what do you want to do now? Like do you want to first discuss this internally and see if the company is going to be open for that additional cost to get everyone Google licenses, or do you want me to take you through the demo? Like what do you suggest?

Ben:
  You can do for demo? But if, for the different login user, is it possible to use Gmail com or must be a Google workspace account?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It has to be a Google workspace account.

Ben:
  It must be a Google workspace. Yes. Alright. If I, without the Google workspace account?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'm sorry.

Ben:
  If without the Google workspace account, is it possible to use it?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, like we have to have Google workspace account for each individual. How would they log in? They will not be able to see the shared inbox itself. So all the team members who are added in the shared inbox, they're accessing the shared inbox from the Gmail accounts. So hiver sits on Gmail itself. So you have to have a Gmail credential for you to be able to access this account. And it has to be a domain account because when you're replying to an email, it has to be from the same domain, right? Only when I'm logged in from the hiver, helpdesk. Com. Am I allowed to send the response from support at the rate? Likewise, this could be sales. Com. So that's why we need same domain accounts itself. It cannot be Gmail. Com. And then companydomain. Com. Oh, alright. Yeah. So yeah, I mean you can, and otherwise see once that is done, you would have these sections that will then help you sort of define your day to day workflow. You will, there will be no more confusion because then you will be giving ownership to each email to each person from here, so you can assign the emails to the right person and they will see it within their mind section. There will be no more confusion in the team who is handling what. So everybody can see within the team section here as to who is actually working on which email. So there will be a lot of visibility, clarity. And the things that you're currently facing, there wouldn't be any duplicate efforts. If I am responding to this email, if someone comes on the same email, they will get this line that Yukta is replying to replying here so that there are no duplicate efforts as well. So I think then your purpose will be met once you have started using this… I understand. Do you also have any budget assigned for this project? In particular? Like what stage are you in terms of your evaluation?

Ben:
  We currently haven't set a budget for that, but just under reviewing and exploring.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So what I can do, I can share the resources with you over the email and you can go through it and you can discuss this internally. If you're ready to introduce individual logins, you could let me know over the email and then we can take the evaluation forward. So I think that should be the ideal step otherwise with a single login, hiver may not be the right fit for you at this point.

Ben:
  All right. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Anything else from your side that I could help you with Sven?

Ben:
  Are you done your demo? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think this, is it anything specific that you would want me to showcase?

Ben:
  Could you share again because I didn't see it clearly?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So this is the share inbox here. So this is where you'll be able to sort of assign emails and track the progress from open pending, closed and respond to these emails here. So this is how it's going to look like from the workflow for an agent or a salesperson, right? The.

Ben:
  Assign to function, is it automatically or it must be set manually? It?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can be both ways. We can set it up automatically as well through the workflow. So the emails can get automatically assigned to the right person. All right. Yeah. And then if you want, when they're responding to an email, they can also use email templates. So you can actually put all the standard responses in hiver template repository. So that when you're responding to any email, you just pick the right template. You can insert the placeholder, and you can just send the response right away from here itself. So that you don't have to then type the response each time and team can also collaborate within themselves. So that is also something that we can do. So, let's say I am working on this email currently. And if I want to, you know, collaborate with my colleague Rakesh, I can just message him right here and we both can converse in regards to this email. Rakesh will receive a notification in this bell icon. He will come and see my message. He will give me a response here. He can just reply to this message itself and we both can collaborate on the same email without having to forward it or mark each other in CC. So this also becomes very easy for us to then multiple people working on the same email, while one person remains the owner. So that we have the accountability as to who needs to close this email within here.

Ben:
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So this is something we can do anything specific that you want apart from what you already mentioned because those things I've already covered if there is anything specific that you're interested in. I'm happy to show them.

Ben:
  Once the email are actually sent to the share email account. So the one who responding or who reply the message will be the individual email address? No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Like you can use interchangeably when you're responding to an email, you can either respond from your individual email address, or you can use the same sales email address. Oh.

Ben:
  All right. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So it's your choice. You can choose any of these.

Ben:
  Okay.

Ben:
  I think that's it, you could cover multiple things.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm sorry, I missed the last part. You said something.

Ben:
  Okay. Can I know the free function and the pit function? What are the main differences?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  The free plan and the plan. In the free plan, I think you can create one shared inbox. It's just that everything is going to remain manual, so you can assign emails manually. You can track the progress of those emails. You can collaborate, but you will not have these tags to categorize your emails into different categories. The templates that I showed, you will not have these templates to be able to put in here, but you can manage the basic functionality within hiver by creating the shared inbox and then managing it, assigning it to the right person tracking it also. So, if this is your main concern, then you can definitely go with the free plan.

Ben:
  But with the integration of this hiver, we can still use the main function from the Gmail, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you will be able to use Gmail, as it is all the functionalities of Gmail. You can use. Yes, and your private inbox will remain private to you. So the emails that are coming and going to your individual email address, those will not be part of, hiver will only be restricted to managing your shared email address, which is your sales inbox and that's it.

Ben:
  Oh, okay. So we can either access to the inbox or the hiver shared inbox.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, that's true. Yeah, you can manage your individual inbox as well and you can manage the hiver inbox.

Ben:
  Oh, all right. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, if your free plan suffices, your need, in that case, you can explore to get everyone workspace accounts from Google, pay that cost and hiver, you can go for the free plan and you can save cost here to begin with. And later on, if your budget allows, you can always move to the growth plan as well at any point.

Ben:
  All right. Because I was trying to use the shared account, which is the Google workspace as the shared account as a shared inbox. And then I tried to create an account with a Gmail. Com. I think it works actually, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Gmail. Com will not work.

Ben:
  It has to be, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Ben:
  But I tried a few days ago, it actually works.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  See, even if you set up the Gmail. Com, you will not be able to send the response from the sales email address. So your responses will go from Gmail. Com, which I'm sure you will not, you would not want.

Ben:
  Okay. I understand.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, and that also sort of creates a lot of security concerns when you are, you know, accessing the company inbox from the Gmail com account, that's not very ideal from the security standpoint as well.

Ben:
  All right. I understand. Yeah… I think you covered the most of the thing. So I might consider to switch for Google workspace account first.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can do that. And if you want, I am happy to connect again with you once you have discussed this internally and you can let me know at that point, how you would like to proceed, whether you, would you're open to sort of get the workspace account or what it is.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, would you like to connect or do you want to wait and just reach out whenever you're ready? What do you suggest?

Ben:
  I would check for a Google workspace first, and then I'll let you know, okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No problem. Then then let me know if you have any questions anyways. I will share the details with you over the email as well.

Ben:
  No problem. Feel.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Free to reach out to me whenever you're ready.

Ben:
  All right. Thank you so much. No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries. Thank you. Bye bye bye.
