Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hey, Irene. How are you?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Good. Thank you for asking.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Great. How has it been going in terms of the trial? Have you been exploring? I know you did add your teammates as well, which is great. And you had some questions in regards to the rules in hiver, let me know like overall feedback on the tool and if you have any specific questions.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Overall, it seems to be working. I haven't used a lot of the automation, but the email templates are great for using and the way that I can refer… the cases to my team members. One thing we did notice that we have an option of responding to the email as our personal email or from the support. But if you do, my colleague tested it and he sent an email as Mikael as from support and it doesn't you can't see it in the inbox. I saw it as in my inbox, but he doesn't see the email from, in his inbox, and because he doesn't see it in his inbox or from sent mails, there's a possibility that if you respond as a support at gasera fi… if the other persons don't see that you have already responded, that was something that we didn't quite figure out how it works. So we just don't use it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, if I understand this correctly, he tried to reply from his own email address. And when he did that, he was not able to see the rest of the thread of that email. Is that what happened?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  No, he created an email which he sent as support at gasera fi. So it's then the, and send it to the support mail. So then it should, but I don't know. Wait a minute.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Could you share your screen? Yes?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Just… a minute. Yeah.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yes. So… I can see it from here. So he sent this mail. It was a support test. So he sent it as support at gasera fi to himself.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. To.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  His personal email. So, and now I… could, I don't know, how was it? Like I could see the message? I can't see it in the sent messages of… testifier. We… did test, and then I… responded to, that email and sent testing. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  me check.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  So, it does show that message… to me. I can see him sending message… but he can't.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  okay. So he cannot see where, like, is he not seeing it? He?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Sent messages or his inbox neither. So he can send the message as… support, but he can't see it anywhere. So that was really strange and.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think what's see? So this person, Mikel, he is, he's part of the shared mailbox with his business email address, right? Which is at the rate gasera. Fi, now here, what's happening? He wrote an email from support at the rate on which we have the shared mailbox on. So it came from support at the rate to you address to you, right? So it is part of the shared mailbox, which is fine. After that, this email, he will be able to see in the shared mailbox, what you are seeing after that, what is happening you replied? Can you click on that? You replied to support at the rate email address only, right? So now this will go, this will go into the support at the rate account. So where is he not seeing this email? Is he? So I'm not clear on that part because he must be seeing it in this inbox as you are seeing it.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yes, but he didn't see this, the original mail. He has a worry that, if we use email thread and we answer it as support at gasera, do we, where do we see that mail?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So why you didn't see it in the shared mailbox is because this email is written from support at the rate, right? So you will not see it directly in coming into the unassigned section because the shared mailbox is created for you and the team to handle all the incoming emails which are written at support at the rate, right? Since he initiated a new email using the support at the rate email address. So what happened whenever you write an email from your side, that email automatically has the status of closed, right? So you, he or you will be able to see those emails. If you go under all views there, which is below team section. So if you click on all views whenever you write any email not here in the, all views right? Below this section?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So this is where you will be able to see the closed emails, right? So you see right below pending section, you have the closed ones. So this is where you have all your emails which you are marking as closed that you have already worked on, right? So these would be for the emails that you're receiving, and for the emails that you are writing or initiating from your site, they will automatically be marked as closed. So you will have to come to the closed section if, in case you want to mark it as open, right? So you'll have to change that status or if you don't want to do, that is also fine. Whenever you get a reply on that email on the same thread, it will come back into the unassigned section, right? So, does that make sense?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yes, yes, I understood.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So he can find it in the closed section whenever anybody, and this remains valid for everyone. Whenever anyone writing an email from their site, they can find those emails in the closed section here.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Okay. Other than that, we didn't have a lot of time for testing and few team members just installed the hiver, so, but I used it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And I.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  think it's working for me.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Understood. That is great if you want. I can also do a training for everyone. I know you have added four of your colleagues or four of your team members right now, but if you want, you can invite everyone and we can do a short training session for them so that as they start using the tool, they know what they're getting into and how all the functionalities work. Do you want me to do that? I am happy to conduct that for you.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  That would be great. I can ask everyone if, they want training because it's also if having such tool, you need to know how to use it. So, yeah, exactly.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So we can do that. I am happy to run that for you apart from it. Do you have any questions on the rules that we were discussing over the email or is that something, that you got a clarity on?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  I think I got it. The one thing I was trying to find was the shared comment, I haven't used that and I would have needed it today, but I didn't remember where to find it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Shared comment. Like whenever you leave a note on any email, yeah. Okay. So for that, you'll have to go to that specific email. So if you go and click on any email here as an example… so.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yeah, I won't talk.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  I think this was the one.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you will see the note in the activity section there. If you have written something on the right panel in hiver, if you scroll down.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Ah, there's the add note, right? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is where you can add a note. And if the email is assigned to someone else and you don't want to miss such emails wherein you left a note, you want to be on top of it, you want to see what's happening. You can always click on this eye button to start following such email. You see this eye button on top in hiver next to the wand. Not there. There are three hiver buttons like on top of just right above the subject line?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Ah, there. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So if you click on that, what will happen here now, you will be able to see all the emails that you have left a note or you are collaborating on in one section. So if you come out of this team section for me, please, I'll show you where you will find these emails. Yeah. So here you see this following section right above. Supporting. So this is where you can see those emails wherein you're leaving notes or somebody else is leaving you a note. But at the time when someone is leaving you note or mentioning your name, you will get a notification for that. So that is fine. But so that if you have 10 such emails wherein you're collaborating, of course, chances are that you lose them. So you can always follow them and you can stop following as soon as it's done.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, great.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  That's good.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Awesome. Then Irene, any other question that you have from the product standpoint that I could help you with?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  No, I think that was it for the level that we are using it. Now. I think we will know more when we use it more.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely agree. Your trial is also going to be there for I think four more days. So it's going to be expiring on Monday next week. So before that, do you want to schedule a training session for the team? Let's say for tomorrow, if that helps or what do you suggest?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Maybe if I'll ask who's interested? Maybe there's more than just the ones that I've added already. Okay, people might be interested because I didn't add everyone yet. Yeah, testing. So maybe I'll ask for the interest and then respond to you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. I think that sounds great. And otherwise, what do you think of the next steps from here as your trial will expire, are we looking at certain timeline? Do you think that by next week, you would want to implement this if everything goes well, or what are your thoughts on that?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yes. And I'll be talking about this tomorrow more with my supervisor and we will make it official.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Decision on at what? I think we are certainly going to implement this, but at what level that's the discussion? Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So your supervisor is going to be involved here in terms of the decision making and understanding how we are going about it. Anybody else like who is going to be potential, you know, evaluator or an influencer in terms of taking this forward?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  No, I think it's we have a small company and it's mainly me, the support is, my area and it's mainly the finances that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  think it's kind of my decision, but I need to.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. No problem. Yeah. So what we can do, I can extend your trial by let's say three days so that you have enough time sometime next week as well till Thursday, Friday. You can still carry on with the testing. And if we could have a placeholder for like Monday around the same time or probably a little later… we can connect and then you could either let me know before that. If the team wants to have the training, we can then shift the timing accordingly, however you decide, or we can just connect to explore if you have any follow up questions, any feedback from your supervisor and how you would like to take this forward? Will that work?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yes, that would be great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then let me do that for Monday. And in the meantime, you carry on with the testing, let me know if you have any questions, and I can help you with that over the email?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Okay. Thank you. Thank.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You so much. Have a great weekend ahead and speak to you next week?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Thank you. You too. Have a good weekend.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Thank you. Bye bye bye.
