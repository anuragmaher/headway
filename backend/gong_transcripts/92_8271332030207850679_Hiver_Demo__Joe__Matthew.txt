Vanessa Alonzo (vanessa@mightynonprofits.com):
  hello, Matthew?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, Vanessa. How you doing?

Vanessa Alonzo (vanessa@mightynonprofits.com):
  I'm doing great. How are you? How are you today?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'm doing great. Just pulling up the information here.

Vanessa Alonzo (vanessa@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay. Just let, I'm gonna send a chat to, okay. Joe is here?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Fantastic.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Hello?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, Joe. How you doing?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Good. You in the bay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, actually, that's just a virtual background, but I'm not too far. I'm in Los Angeles, yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Just trying to get the golden gate up there, old pal back there, like a lakers sign or something. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, it's all about the dodgers right now.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Alright. I'm a big warriors fan baseball. I don't care.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, actually, the head of sales here at hiver, he's from San Jose and he's a diehard bay area sports fan, niners warriors, everything.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  All the way. Yeah, there you go. Well, perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, appreciate you both joining. So, the agenda for the call today, wanted to spend the first five minutes or so, just getting a better understanding of what you're looking for and helping you determine if hiver can fit your needs.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then from there, I can go ahead and walk through the product and answer any questions that you have. Sound good?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Perfect. Yeah, great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Want to start here. Tell me a little bit about kind of what, what's motivating the search here.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah. So we're a bookkeeping company, right? We've got about 13 staff and about 75 clients and so probably… a couple 100 inbound messages a day. That right now we're using Google groups, right? So every client has a unique Google group. And then we can assign our team to the Google group if that's their client, right? So it's like each team member has a certain number of clients. And so that's how we've been doing all the communications. But we're growing quickly and it's becoming, we need better tools at this point. Google groups just isn't cutting it, right? We want to be able to analyze things, have a little more sophistication in our replies, have everything you know, sort of synthesized in one spot, you know, have stuff for our managers to be able to see their whole team's performance, their inbox, right? All that jazz, instead of having to go through 75 different Google groups. So we've been looking at different shared inbox systems, right? And we're trying to compare and contrast right now, we did a deep dive with helpscout. And the software is broken. It does not work, right? Unfortunately, we almost adopted that. We kind of backed out last minute because the rules and stuff don't work very well. So we're checking out hiver, we're checking out, you know, Zendesk, we're checking out Hubspot, we're checking out a few other things, but we need something to really organize our communications better.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And this is exactly what hiver does and it's a really good fit for teams that are coming over from that are already using Google groups because hiver, just basically, we're a certified Google partner. You just simply plug in those Google groups into hiver and it's fairly. You know, the reason people use us over things like a Zendesk as well is that it's just fairly easy to use, but it's also very powerful and very scalable as well. So those are all things that hiver could do. Just curious. I just want to make sure was there anything particular with helpscout that it couldn't do?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah. A little insider information for you. The workflows and tagging systems in helpscout are broken.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. They are.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  super glitchy, and they don't work the way they're intended to?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Interesting. They won't.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Tell you that they're broken. I finally got customer support to admit it. Yeah, they say it's glitchy. It can be glitchy. Like we can't have glitchy when we're missing important accounting communications from our clients like glitchy's not. Okay. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah, great. So, yeah, let me just go ahead, and as far as your timeline goes, I know you're looking at some other solutions here. If hiver was a good fit, is this something that you'd want to get going fairly soon here, or?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  We want our systems in place, tested and solid throughout the whole organization before the end of the year. We don't want to do it. We want everything set and ready. So, yeah, we're going to be implementing, hopefully making a decision within a week or two and then going for it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Awesome. Well, hiver, I'll show you today. It's fairly easy to get up and running. We also have an onboarding process to train everybody. So we can move fairly fast here. So no problem. Can you see my screen?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, just a little bit of background about hiver. We're a help desk platform. We have over 200 employees. We have over 2000 paid customers in over 50 countries with teams using our platform ranging from small businesses, mom and pop shops, quite a few bookkeeping companies. This is a fairly common use case for us. And then also some of the biggest companies in the world. Companies like capital one, openai, flexport, just to name a few. So it's very scalable. And the reason that people often come to us is I'm sure this is pretty similar to you is if they're just using things like Gmail, which it sounds like you are, it's sometimes it's unclear who's handling these emails. You often have to forward these emails, CC people manually routing and tagging them, no unified view, past conversations, switching between different applications, and also hard to measure and analyze these conversations that are coming in and also measure the performance of the team members. The kind of impacts that you can see is just faster response time, ticket deflections, faster ramp up times. And then, you know, minimal manual effort. So, I think we, you're all on you're. On board with that. So we'll just get into it. So yeah, one of the, one of the big differences between hiver and these other platforms is that hiver is actually an extension in Gmail, so.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah. It's a big difference here with you guys and the other stuff we're looking at.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, yeah, you just simply download the hiver extension. Once you download it, you're going to see these yellow icons in the upper right corner here. And then you're going to see these yellow icons down here on the left. So your personal emails are not connected to hiver, right? So you're going to be able to answer your personal emails just like normal. Except now you're going to get notifications right here. And then you're also going to have easy access to those different groups that you have on the left hand side.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, then we'll just go ahead and hop into one of these folders here. So each folder can be tied to one group or it could be tied to multiple of those groups.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  So, you're talking about the Google groups?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Oh, so these, this is working with Google groups?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Okay. Is your, is your Google groups? Like it's per client? Is that how you have it set up? Yeah. Okay. Got it. And like, what would an example group be? Just?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  So, like we have a big client, coastal quest. So, their email is coastal at mighty nonprofits. Com.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Okay. That's what I thought.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Any communications from that client goes straight to that email.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And, would you potentially want that want to have different? Is it like a different workflow for each one?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  For each client? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Well, there's different staff members assigned and managing and taking care of it. And then we have their manager manages all of that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, okay. Yeah.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  We just need to make sure that… Google groups is not very sophisticated as far as like tagging like doing drafts forwarding stuff, adding notes, all that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Of course, of course. And that's why you add hiver because hiver does all those things with those groups. So got it. Okay. Perfect, got it. So, yep. So basically, we can set up these folders. They're going to be tied to those groups, right? And then once you have, and then also you choose who has access to these folders, right? So maybe obviously, there's maybe there's some team members who don't need access to every single group, right? So you choose who has access to them. If you wanted to give everybody access to everything that's you know, obviously an option as well and how it works is once you tie, once you tie a group to this folder, every time somebody emails, that group, it's going to land in the unassigned section of that folder, right? And now, when you open these emails, you're going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you're going to be able to assign it to people. So if I were to assign this to, matt will get notified. And then also within these folders, everyone's going to have their own mind section and that's all the work that's been assigned to them specifically.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  So anybody that's assigned to that folder, the support folder will see the unassigned and then they can manually do it. And then I guess the next thing is there's rules probably too.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. There's automations where we can set it up where these can automatically go to certain, go to the right person, like for instance, if you handled, all the tax, all the tax emails that they have, right? So we can set up automations with keywords, right? So it could be based off keywords in the subject or the body of the email. If the word tax or invoice or any of these keywords are mentioned in it, then we can have it automatically get routed to you.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, it's interesting because with these other shared inbox, it's like we basically switch all our clients to one email address contact at mightynoprovidence, com. And then most of the rules we're setting up is just to make sure that it gets assigned as that client, right? This if it's tying straight into Google groups already, that's the majority of the routing is just making sure the Google group is correct, but it's already tied in here. So yeah… yeah, not a lot more routing would be necessary within our groups.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. That's just how I'm envisioning it too, but, you know, I obviously I can, our onboarding team can also help is also going to help out with it as well too and also pass, you know, your use case by my manager as well, and see what he thinks. But, yeah, I'm thinking that the best way would just to be have, those separate folders per group.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, I didn't even realize you guys tied the Google groups in like this?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes, big one. Yes, exactly. So you'll see here like each folder. So support is tied to the email support at hiverhelpdesk. Com. Finances with finance at hiverhelpdesk. Com. And when you create it, right? You… just go ahead and create the shared inbox… stop.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  And it works with groups that's crazy. Yeah. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Yeah. A lot of people come to us with just groups?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, then, yeah, we got that tagging… we can do automations for the tagging as well. Talk.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Me through the layers of automation. I know it's kind of getting nerding out a little bit, but just curious what sort of variables and criteria are within the automations. Because as it's more sophisticated, that's sort of a key issue. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So let's go to automations here. We really have a ton. So we have different workflows that you can get set up. So these are like if the sentiment of the email, so we have AI which can actually track the sentiment. So if it's negative, it can get assigned to someone a tag. We can do a sign based on… senders, we can actually send replies after, no, if there's been no reply from them. So basically how it works is, so it's a bunch of triggers, right? So the trigger could be a new conversations received, right? These are all the different triggers that can actually start it, you know, actually somebody, a reason that a lot of people come over to us from Zendesk. Is for this SLA, one, we can have it. So that if nobody responds right to an email once it's received after a set amount of time, we can then have something happen based on that.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But we have a, we have a bunch here. So these are just the first ones that can happen. So I'll just do an if a new conversations received.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Do you have anything based on company or based on domain?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Domain? Yep. Domain.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Look at you. Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. So if a new email is received and the domain is, you know, let's just say hiver com or… you know,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  or in the body, it mentions the word taxes invoice… then we want it to… automatically get assigned to this person and… we want it to automatically add… this tag.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then also summarizes it for you up here too. So, when the email is received in the support mailbox, if the sender's domain is hiver, com, or the email contains either taxes or invoice in the body, the system will automatically assign it to Alex crum and add a tag refund?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. So yeah, yeah, a lot of different possibilities you can do with these different automations.

Vanessa Alonzo (vanessa@mightynonprofits.com):
  What about the reporting? What kind of reports I can get and how they are created?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So reporting is, really, quite easy. It's right here on the side, it's analytics… you select the mailbox that you want to see from the dropdown. You then select the timeframe, could be custom dates.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Could be the last 90 days could be last month, anything that you want to see and you're going to see things such as how many new emails did you get in that timeframe? How many of those emails did you resolve? Is it up or down from the previous month that you selected? You can analyze and slice and dice this data however you want. If you wanted to see it by person, right? If you wanted to filter for any custom fields, if you wanted to filter for any of that data, you could do that. You can save these views as well. It's also going to show you the workload across the team. So like in the past month, we've assigned, you know, 128 emails to Cole, you know, 89 to Rakesh, and then also tracks each person's performance as well. So their average first response times, the resolution times, we can also do customer satisfaction surveys as well.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Does it do it only by folder? Or can you do it for the whole org?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You could do it. So this, these prebuilt reports are only by each folder, but you can build a report, you can build a custom report that, that's going to look at all the folders?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  All the folders. Okay, great. Because that's more we want to see for the whole, for all the clients, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep, exactly. And then you're going to see tags. So like you can say, okay, you know, what type of emails did we get over the past month from this client? We got 94 emails about billing issues or, you know, we got 16 emails about invoices, et cetera, and then also even tracks for, these tags, what's the average response time on them, resolution time, et cetera. Yep. And then also one more thing is I want to show you SLA reporting as well. So, yes, you know, are you familiar with slas?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, Zendesk charges more for them?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, we do have different packages too. So I'm not going to try to sound like, you know, the high or high and mighty, but yeah, I mean, typically, our pricing is better, than Zendesk, but basically, yeah, SLA reporting too. So then you could see how many violations you had in the past month. Is it, is it down or is it higher than the last previous month? Is the compliance higher or less than the last previous month? Like I said, we can also do customer satisfaction surveys as well. And then we have various AI features. This is something that we do. This is our only real upcharge is if you wanted access to the AI features and how we do it is we basically just package everything together. If you wanted to do the AI stuff. It comes with all the features that we have all the AI that's coming out.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And basically what the AI sentiment does is, it keeps track of the sentiment of these emails that are coming in. Yeah… right. And then here's the custom reports that you can build and have saved here as well. All this information is exportable. You can export all this. You can choose what types of reports that you want. You can also set up different dashboards. And then for each one of these folders too, there's going to be a team view. This is going to allow the managers to see all the open emails across that client. So, in this client's email or group that you had. I can see that we have 19 open emails that need to be addressed. I can easily see who's responsible for them, right? Utah has five. I have two et cetera. I can see which ones are late. So these red lightning bolts here is letting us know that these slas have been violated. So that these ones right here are late.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I can click on any of these emails. I can see all the back and forwards they've had with this. With this email. I can see when the email came in, any changes that were made to it, everything is logged down here. You can add notes as well. Here. You can also hit the at mention button here. Everyone's name pops up and it's like, hey, can you respond to this?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then Cole here would go ahead and get notified that he needs to respond to this email. Also, you can set up email templates that can be accessed by everyone. This is just to save time for those kind of repetitive emails that you get, we also have in the automations. You can also set up automations where emails get sent out to. So if certain automations get triggered, you can have an email go out that way. One of the AI features that we have is like an AI chat gpt where you can just quickly fix the grammar, make it more empathetic, et cetera.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We also do have an AI co pilot which I'm sure some of these other vendors have showed you theirs as well where it can actually learn from the emails that you're getting and can draft a reply. Ours works. It asks you a three prompt question. You choose the prompt that you want… and then it will go ahead and write it up. And then you can use that or make changes to it et cetera. So it actually learns from the emails. And then also, you can add documents in the back end of it too so that it can reference those and it can reference urls and make more contextual answers when providing answers.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay. Train your AI. Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  And we're talking about all this and I'm looking at this, I'm thinking it's like it… seems like this is more built so that like all our client info, like our day to day bookkeeping stuff, usually that would all just be under one folder, right? And then depending on who we need to assign it to, we would assign it. But since we already have Google groups and 100 of them or 70 of them, right? In that sense, maybe it would make sense to just keep them in each folder, but the system was kind of more built out for. So like not just the client bookkeeping would just be one folder and then maybe marketing a different folder and finance a different, I don't know, I'm wondering, can you do subfolders?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can. So, yeah, we could set up different like subfolders here with the different clients like group key.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Like key group folders or?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. We just call them views, but they're basically like they're like subfolders, so you can.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  do views and they can have folders within them.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Like for instance, like if, for like if there was a certain domain, your client domain, I think you said it was coastal collective. Is that one?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Coastal quest is one of them, yeah, coastal.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Quest, right? So basically, if we had the automation that said every time somebody from the domain, coastal quest emails in to add the coastal quest tag, right? And then we could, then we could have that tag, we could use that tag to create a view. So we, so we'd have a coastal quest view. And then in that coastal quest view, it would have all the emails that are tagged with the coastal quest.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay. And then with the views, are you able to add some people to that view or not sort of?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that's where we might be better if you had separate folders. But basically, if somebody's shared on one of these folders, they're going to be able to see all the views.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Okay. But is the view, so the view is from a, is completely separate or what's how does this work here? What's the difference between the view and the folders from the overarching structure?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I would basically just describe the views like a subfolder like you kind of mentioned?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Oh, so a view is a subfolder. So a view, I couldn't have several folders be part of one view. Like let's say, I wanted to see Tom's.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  clients, right? So it might be like six or seven different folders combined.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I think you can say it one more time.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Like I want to see, I want a view that shows like three or four of my clients all together, three or four of these folders.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, if you want a view that shows like three or four of them together.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Sounds like folders is sort of the top level?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, not really in this one. You would be able to do that, in the analytics view, but yeah, not in this one. It's just, yeah, folders, the top level, and then it gets broken down from there.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Because the alternative here is us to use this more like the shared inbox style, which is let's just, we route all our client, all our client communications to one inbox, right? That'll be one folder and we can assign it based on rules based on domain, based on whatever, right that's more like the classic shared inbox style.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right… right. Yeah, absolutely. And then, and then on the next call, I'm actually just going to include somebody else on the call as well and he can kind of help us decipher what would be the best way to have it set up in hiver?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Yeah, that'd be great cause you guys are a little unique, right? Than the other techs. I'm just trying to wrap my head around how, but a lot of options, there are a lot of potential and it could integrate super simply. So, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. You've onboarding too. So we'd help you set this up, training. We also offer 24 seven support too. So if you look at the online reviews for us, one of the best things is the 24 seven support instant chat support directly and, it goes to a real person here at hiver, they'll also get on the phone with you as well. So yeah, a lot of support here, help center, help you get set up and, you use Hubspot as well or?

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  No, no, we're meeting with them in two minutes, oh.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Well, I was going to say just because we have different integrations too.

Joe Golinveaux (joe@mightynonprofits.com):
  Do you guys integrate with clickup? We do look at that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That's our main, our main tech here. Okay, great. So, yeah, exactly. So, how the integrations work here. When you pull up an email, you'll see this apps button here and this will pull through cards and it will show you the clickup information in there. Yeah, great. And then you can also create a clickup task directly from hiver as well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Nice. All right. We only got two minutes left, pricing, what's the pricing on this? Yep? So, our pricing's all on our page. I wasn't sure the tier, how, where we fit. Really, I think we were somewhere between growth and pro, and I didn't quite, couldn't quite tell which. Yeah. So, how many people do you have again? 13? Okay. 13 people. Got it. That's what I thought. We're adding about three people a year. They, they've been growing really fast. Okay. Got it. So, we do sell in buckets of five. So, and then, you know, base, we have an annual option and a monthly option here. Obviously, you can save a bit of money for doing the annual. The pro is about 45 dollars per user per month. Growth is capped at 10 users. So that automatically puts you in the pro, adds 45 dollars a user a month, build it buckets of five. You can't buy individual buckets of five. Now, it's crazy. I never heard of that. Who, who came up with that? Not me, what happens when we hit 16 people? We, we, that sucks. No, we'll accommodate to you even on the initial purchase here. You know, we don't want you paying for more than that, but yeah, we do sell, we do sell in buckets of five. The other thing is too. So, the AI stuff, is an additional 20 dollars per user per month. It's across the entire account if you want, it includes absolutely everything. So it's fairly easy there. And then the one other thing though that would actually put you in the elite package here. And like I said, we're going to work with you on pricing? Okay. So, and then we're going to have to jump. We're we're a little late. Okay. Yeah, no problem. So, the one thing is, you're really only, you're only allowed to have like five of those shared email groups set up in the pro account. If you need more than, that puts you in the elite package. Sure. So that means Google groups, yeah, the Google groups. Yeah. Oh, that wouldn't work. At all then? Well, no, our elite package is unlimited but that's way more expensive, right? It's a little bit more. But like I said, I'm going to work with you on pricing.

  Cool. All right. Sorry, we got to jump, maybe we'll follow up via email. Yeah, let's do that. I want to set up a call and talk about how we'd set up, your structure here. Appreciate the time. Sounds good. Thanks Matthew. Thanks bye bye.
