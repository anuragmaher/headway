Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  weirded out. Awesome. So we got you here, Brian's on the line as well. Brian, can you hear me?

Brian Barcheski (brian@axiosrecruitment.com):
  I can.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. How you doing?

Brian Barcheski (brian@axiosrecruitment.com):
  Doing well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Well, awesome. So the agenda for the call today, just want to spend the first couple of minutes or so getting an understanding of what you're looking for, helping you determine if hiver can fit your needs. And then from there, I can walk through the product and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Kait:
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, if you want to start, tell me a little bit about what motivated you to book this meeting.

Kait:
  Yeah. So we've been running more digital campaigns that have been pretty successful. We've seen quite an increase in site traffic, but what we want to toy with now is hopefully improving traffic conversion on actual form fills. So we thought that by potentially implementing a live chat function, it would help warm leads up a little bit more if people were able to just kind of reach out while they're on the site to ask some basic questions.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So that's kind of the predominant reason that you're considering hiver here is for a chat, the chat function.

Kait:
  For sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then, are you a Google suite company or Microsoft?

Kait:
  We use Microsoft currently?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Currently, do you plan on switching to Google or anything like that? Is that or not really?

Kait:
  So, no.

Brian Barcheski (brian@axiosrecruitment.com):
  No.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. No problem. Okay. So you want to have a chat on your website? Got it. Okay. And then how many people would be managing these chats potentially?

Kait:
  I would say starting off like probably just one designated person, but up to three obviously just to make sure we have coverage and people are out.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So, yeah, we could potentially do that. One of the core functions of hiver as well as email management for shared emails. Was that of any interest or not really just chat?

Kait:
  Probably just chat for now?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So we do have that. We do have chat, right? You can put a chat on your website. This is what hiver looks like. It's a web application. You're going to log in using your Microsoft credentials. And then down here is the chat feature. So the chats will come in. They can get assigned to each other. Let's see if we have something down here. So, yeah, you can put the chats on your website here. They can come in. They can get assigned to each other. You can apply things like tags, names… see where it got initiated, et cetera.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But, yeah, I'll be upfront with you, right? Like we do have a chat feature. Our main proficiency as of today is really email management. And then as an addition, we have some light chat capabilities. So, yeah, I'm just being transparent there. It's not predominantly used as just a chat at this time especially for our outlook product. We have two products, a Gmail product and an outlook product. The chat's a little bit more built out in our Gmail product currently, but it is possible you can put a chat feature on your website and then they can be managed in hiver.

Kait:
  So, just to make sure I'm understanding then, so we're able to include the little pop up for people to initiate chat while on the website. And then as they start typing their message, would you be notified from your email then or you would need to open the hiver app to access that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You would need to open the hiver app, okay?

Kait:
  And then what about any like automated messaging? Like if we use the chat function, would we be able to have like a tree, I guess where people can kind of choose their own journey before they're kicked to a live agent?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes, yep. You can do that. You can set up. Yeah, you can set up trees where basically based on certain questions that they ask it'll, go to certain people based on that. I'm just seeing here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'll have to double check on that. I know we could do that in our Gmail product here. I'd have to double check if we can do that on the outlook product.

Kait:
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep.

Kait:
  Because, yeah, I would say that's the number one thing that we're trying to achieve with the chat function is just being able to answer some initial questions. People are having to hopefully help them convert into sales prospects. But it more or less is just like a pretty low volume. I would say where we wouldn't need like a full email response support or management tool. It's more or less just like I said, having someone to initially answer some of the questions, whether they're like automated responses for like commonly asked questions. And then it can be kicked to a live agent if it needs to be elevated.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Yeah, I know we could do that quite easily on Gmail here. I just got to confirm with this outlook one, it's fairly new, the chat feature in our outlook product. So just want to confirm that, that's possible. But yeah, essentially, that's exactly how it would work. Is it, you know, it can have that tree can go to different people. There'll be answers for it. And then based on those selections, it can get kicked to a live person.

Kait:
  Okay.

Kait:
  And then there are transcripts, recorded, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, like, the chat being recorded?

Kait:
  Yes. Yeah.

Kait:
  Okay. Brian, do you have any follow up questions? I guess?

Brian Barcheski (brian@axiosrecruitment.com):
  No, I think that pretty much does it for me. Just wanted to get a peek.

Kait:
  Yeah. So I guess let us know then about the automation capabilities for the outlook function. Obviously, that is like necessary. So, if it's not something we can do currently, that would be good to know. But again, we're really looking for something just like pretty simple. We don't need anything like crazy at least for now.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, absolutely. And…, we're still building our chat and the outlook too. So it'll be more robust here pretty shortly. It's become quite a bigger part of our business as well. But yeah, like I said, you know, we started as a, as an email management platform. We have chat and then we rolled out chat and outlook one. So, yeah, let me find out about those capabilities of outlook and if they're currently available or when they're coming available, and then I can just shoot you an email and we can go from there.

Kait:
  Yeah, that sounds good to me.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Cool. Yeah, thanks, Kate. Thanks. Brian. Have a good one.

Kait:
  You too.
