================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, Jasmine. How are you?

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Hi, hello? Hi, I'm fine. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Thank you for joining me on the call. Do we have anybody else joining us?

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Yes, we are waiting for my calling, Davide.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Okay, all.

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Right. Hopefully we will connect soon.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Sure. We'll wait for a couple of minutes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi, Davide. Thank you for joining.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Hi, Rakesh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi. Nice to meet you nice.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  To meet you too.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Thank you for joining the call. Let me quickly introduce. This is the very first time we are meeting. My name is Rakesh and I take care of sales for the european territory at hiver. I've been with the company for over four years personally onboarded beyond 500 teams today. I'll be your point of contact to run the show. We'll understand what your requirements are with respect to what exactly you're looking to achieve with hiver, and we'll figure out towards the end of the conversation if this is a good platform for your requirements and needs.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Okay, perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, lovely. All right. Now, do you first of all, want to tell me, how did you hear about hiver? I think Yasmin booked a meeting, invited you as well, but would like to understand what were you searching for? That, let you look at hiver?

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Yeah, actually, we just searched on Google and we tried to find platforms basically for like email forwarding, automatic email forwarding.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  So that was the main reason. And then basically like the point is that right now we are using just Gmail accounts and we have some rules in place, but the Gmail rules are a bit strict because they can do email forwarding based on who sent the email, who is receiving the email and some basic rules on the terms in the email, like certain words in the email. And the point is that we needed something more capable to understand the context of the email and create the forwarding based on what's actually written in the email, you know? So that was the main point. And the other point was like the drafting of the email based on knowledge base. Currently, we have our knowledge base on notion and we would like to have like an automatic drafting based on what we have on notion.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So basically you're looking at automation on workflows wherein if there is an email that comes and hiver understands the context of the email tags, that email, you want it to be routed to a specific user in your team. Because let's say Rakesh takes care of all the scheduling information. Jasmine takes care of all the, you know, cancellation requests. So based on it, you want the automation of forwarding of emails to the right people in your team. And secondly, since the knowledge base is hosted on notion. So you want hiver to automatically understand the context of the email and the AI draft can help your agents draft those responses automatically. Your agents would simply proofread and send those to the customers to the patients, exactly.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Exactly. That's it because like a lot of Alexa activated always like randomly… Alexa stop. Okay. I don't know why. Okay. Sorry. So, yeah, basically, it's what you said because also we have like those cases in which like there is an automatic response is enough because like sometimes it's just information on the payment for example, or this kind of stuff. While sometimes for example, the doctor has to see and reply and draft a proper reply and write a proper reply. So, yeah, that's why we would need the drafting. The drafting would be useful. Let's say, but the main one is the forwarding. Like that one is the main task we have. Makes sense. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Basically all these emails you want to make sure that these are routed and forwarded to the right set of person and you have a complete visibility. If Rakesh got the email, David should still be able to see what is he working on. Did Rakesh reply to the patient on time? Is there something to do with the response? Was that a correct response? And maybe, you know, the team collaboration as well? Yeah.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Yeah, the team collaboration would be nice. Like we don't have, I don't know like if this is from Jasmine, but from what I understood, like we don't have that much the need of the control itself. Like we don't have to check the job of the others. It's more about like that people are receiving the email, they really have to answer to.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood very clear. Now, David, one last question. Can you please tell me where we receive these emails today? In the inquiries inbox? Like do you have a common inbox, like care at the rate or scheduling at the rate? Like what's that common inbox email address where you receive all your patient inquiries today?

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  I think it's like a single email, but I don't want to be mistaken, Jasmine, can you answer this?

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  The emails are mostly by patients. We receive it to the phone nurse email that is handled by our staff from that staff. But we also receive a lot of emails on the info email.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, info at the rate inbox, and what was the first one you mentioned?

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Phone nurse?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Foreigners at the rate phone?

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Nurse at firstmedcenter. Com.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Very clear. So these are the foreigner patient requests, right?

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  No, no, it's not foreigners but phone nurse telephone.

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  And then medical person?

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Yeah, phone nurse.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. Phone nurse. All right. I get it. Okay. So this is the main inbox where you receive these emails. And then you also get emails into info inbox. And somebody I believe logs in into this email inbox and then route the emails, right? Manually. You're saying today, somebody responds to these. I mean, forward these emails to the individual inboxes to these users, and then they log in into personal inboxes, and reply to those inboxes.

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  No, we receive all appointment inquiries to phone nurse email. And then if any of those inquiries requires some help or there is beyond our competence, then we need to forward the email to the right person. So the main reason would be to forward or to mention people in the comments or just have them to ask like we can ask them for suggestions or to help us answer the question or… forwarding it. And then it's done from our side. One thing I wanted to highlight that we don't need everything that has to be forwarded. So I would strictly focus on not being like automated too much. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You want to have a control on the emails coming into your phone, us and any email which is particularly required to be forwarded, then you assign it to the right person. But otherwise, the emails that need to be worked upon comment to each other, collaborate internally. You want to keep a control of it. So that what you're saying is you don't want to miss on any of those appointment emails?

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Yes, because most of the appointments are handled by us and we can handle most things, but some of them need help.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. Okay. And what's the team size today? That, that requires all of these agents to work on these emails and respond and, you know, work on the scheduling and everything.

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Well, from the phoneers, email, at least 10 people work. So we use one email and then we would need one for the lab, one, for the nurses, the medical team, the chief medical and the managers.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, 10 people for your phoneers, and how many other people do we have in the labs and box nurses and box?

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Those are also many people, but we use this one email. So everybody is logged into one email.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Very clear. All right. Anything else that you want me to be aware of with your requirements? And I'll give you a walkthrough on hiver and how simple it is definitely right inside your Gmail, make sure that your emails are not missed and you have a control on it. Any other requirement as such from you, David? Maybe?

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  No, I don't think so. I think that's it, more or less, right? Jasmine.

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Yes, thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Give me one minute. Let me quickly log in into my test account and share a couple of use cases. And of course, show you how hiver works.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Just got to share my screen.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  One minute, please?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Please confirm if you do see my Gmail inbox.

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Yeah, we see. Yes, thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Alright. Now, this is my test account. If you notice, I'm logged in into hiverhelpdesk. Com. My test login. I'm assuming all the people who are going to be logging into fawners, the inbox have their individual accounts, right? Everybody has their individual Gmail logins. No, they're using the same. Okay. So everybody log in using the same common password into fawners at the rate. Yes. Okay. With hiver, we need everyone to log in using their individual login accounts. We don't share the credentials within hiver. And I'll tell you why, if you notice, when we all log in into our individual gmails, and have hiver extension running on top of Chrome browser, we have our personal emails on the top and all the healthcare emails. Like all the scheduling emails, fawner emails, we'll create a shared inbox for you and actually connect your existing inbox. The one which is fawners at the rate to the shared email inbox right here, and that's where we will add the people. So they will have new emails here in the unassigned. When they go to the mind section, they would see, these are the customer requests. These are the lab email. This is an emergency patient request. You know, some appointment request. All of these are automatically tagged emails. This email is overdue. Like the delayed response and that's when you see the shared emails been managed by all 10 people. And from the team section, Jasmine, you would see there are total number of these many people who are working on the emails. And then, you know, you have all of these customer emails. I mean, the patient emails who Rakesh is working on versus this, my another colleague working on these many emails. So you have a complete visibility from the team section. So basically, it works in a way that you all log into individual Gmail accounts, manage your private emails on the top. So if I send an email to David at the rate firstmed, or Jasmine at the rate firstmed, you see those emails on the top inbox. These are not shared with anybody unless you want to open the email and move the email to the shared inbox from here itself. You say, okay, this is not a private email but a customer email. And I can share it with my team. So I get an option right here to just move this email into a mailbox. Let me just quickly refresh my Gmail. Give me one minute, sir. Yeah… it looks like my internet today, but let me just quickly refresh it once.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. So basically, when I go into the healthcare inbox, which is going to be your, you know, inbox for partners… right? And the same inbox can be for your labs at the rate inbox. And then you can have info inbox. So all in all, what we do is log in into the individual gmails and have hiver work into one shared space for the multiple inboxes. So these are going to be your inboxes that's where you would have the responses here coming from your new patients which are not been assigned to anybody. You look at the context, let's say, you know, this is about a refund request. You look at the request and hiver automatically understands and say that this is about appointment. So you add a tag appointment tagged emails can be assigned to Rakesh. So you have the ownership here and this is a patient type. It's an existing patient, whatever the insurance id is like. If you want to just capture more information about this. And from here, this is what Jasmine wanted. You can just add, mention your colleagues, talk to them, drop them the, you know, notes, comments and everything right? From here. So you have the ability to talk to your colleagues while dropping them the notes and everything. And when you assign a conversation, a ticket to one, somebody in the team, you see in the mind section that's where you have mine emails. Like Rakesh has to work on these emails. And if you want to look at how many emails need to work on by the team, you go to the team distribution workload, and that's where you see yokta colleague is working on 12 tickets. Rakesh is working on 10 tickets. So you have a complete workflow distribution load as well. Okay. All right. Apart from that, when I look at this request, let's say this is about a refund request for an appointment. And I know for that, you know, whatever those custom fields that you can use to manage your emails, better, all you do is simply reply to the emails and the replies can have your templates and this could be, you know, let's say I know the patient name. I know they joined me on January the fifteenth and they're asking for a refund. So I know we have got those couple of, you know, email templates that are repetitive in nature and on top of it, if I want to improve the handwriting and everything. So all I can do is just simply use the hiver AI functionality here. Excuse me, bless you. So I have this functionality here. And on top of it, David, what you mentioned was if you could just look at the hiver co pilot, it will help your agents, your doctors draft a response as well. And this draft to reply would definitely work on top of the actual notion as a shared knowledge source for that matter. If I go to hiver AI, just so that, you know, you could get to see what exactly I'm referring to. I go to hiver co pilot. And when I'm looking at the,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  yeah. So you see this knowledge sources notion is already built here. So all you do is just connect to notion. And from there, whatever knowledge sources is hosted on your notion, hiver is able to help your agents. Your doctors simply draft responses. So you can just say, hey, can you help me with a pricing query? So hiver will fetch the information from the notion, look at it. So a couple of emails that we need to try and train hiver on and then moving forward, it would just automatically drop the responses. So you notice this, right? Hiver pricing is transparent and everything. So, yeah… now the email responses can go from your actual email inbox, which is your shared email at the rate inbox. It could be info at the rate. You can have signatures. And in case your teammate is working with each other, you can share the draft also, meaning when you share a draft, your colleague will get an option to edit it and what you can do is then add mention your colleague saying, hey Cole, I have shared a draft with you. Can you make further changes to it? And then my colleague Cole will be able to, you know, make further changes to this draft, make further changes and, you know, improvise it. Now, if somebody else needs to work on it, let's say if, instead of Rakesh, Cole has to work on it or maybe Yasmin has to work. So we will just reassign the ownership, change, the ownership, without forwarding emails to each other, make further improvisations on the draft and send the response to the customer. Now, when I'm done with the test reply, let's say, I'm just going to go ahead and respond to the customer, send an email, close the request, meaning I'm just resolving the query and all the closed emails will then go into the closed bucket for your team. If there is a new reply from the customer with whatever information, you would still be able to see those emails in the mind section, and you will have a complete back and forth happening. And on top of it, if there is a lot of email chain happening and you want to know what's happening for an example. Let me pick this one up. Now, this email has multiple chain of threads to it. All you could see is summarized conversation. Somebody wants to find out really quick. What happened so far? You just summarize the conversation. Hiver will tell you the exact decode of it. Like what was the email about, what has happened so far? You can further save it as a note. And then like from there onward, just say Rakesh needs to work on it. You could just, you know, keep emails in pending because you want to work on the refund requests later. You can even tag these emails. All of this is pretty much possible and Jasmine can control it whether it's a manual assignments or you want to automatically assign, you want to automatically tag these emails. Hiver can take care of that for you.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Yeah. Can we see like, yeah, thank you anyway, for the explanation. I wanted to see more in detail like for example, how you create the rule for out of awarding?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. When I go into the admin panel and I let's say go into the healthcare inbox, and from the automations workflow from here itself, first of all, what I can do is I can create a rule for you and that rule will be… okay. Let me just go into the support inbox and go to automation workflows. And from there, I can create an automation, let's say creating from scratch as in when there is a new email coming into your shared email inbox. And if the condition says email has a very specific subject that contains anything to do with the cancellation or maybe, you know, refund just a one use case, then what you want to do is simply action it on basis of assign it to a specific individual in your team. Let's say all the cancellation and refund requests. If the email talks about something in subject or then other condition could be, if the body also contains anything to do with the cancellation request, refund request, then you assign it to Rakesh and assign it to Rakesh, simply, you know, what you also might want to do is just add a tag automatically to these emails saying this is a new cancellation request. So that's how that's a one quick example of the exact, you know, workflow summary that I showed you.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  But apart from.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  that in,

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  the condition, sorry, you have also like the AI to understand the context in case I don't have a specific, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. In the condition you have the AI variables in the condition, you also understand what the email is about. Hiver, AI is able to categorize those emails for you automatically tag the emails and let's say if the AI variable tag is anything to do with, you know, cancellation request, then you could just simply go ahead and, you know, say assign the conversations to either Rakesh or you could just say from all of the agents available. Like out of all three, whoever has the less tickets, you could just do a load balancing. If Rakesh has two tickets more than these two people, then don't assign it to Rakesh. So you could just do a load balancing. So the answer is yes through the AI. Also, you can do that. On top of it, you could, when you would actually turn on the hiver tagging, the AI tagging, you could configure right on a couple of variables. Like these are the billing related emails. So any email that talks about billing hiver is automatically able to tag those emails as such on billings automatically. And whenever.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Oh, here you create basically the prompt to understand the billing.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That is correct. So that's how you train the AI. So order status, maintenance, onboarding. All of these are just my test accounts, test tags. But yes, we can use these as AI for auto tagging those emails on basis of it. When automatically tagged an email has happened, then you go ahead and create an automation. On basis of it, you could just say whenever there is a tag. Yeah.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  So during the automation, I just have to use the tag and not the entire prompt which is like stored in the other place. Absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's right?

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Yeah, that's clear. That's clear. Nice. Great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And on basis of it, you also have the SLA policies here. Let's say, you know, all the emails that are coming into your, to your care inbox. So all you do is just two hour first response time and you need to close tickets in 24 hours. Now, if that does not happen, you get a trigger, you understand, where are these delayed emails and everything? So just like how you look at the SLA, the service level agreements, you can always choose to do so. And then you have customer satisfaction, this could be a patient satisfaction for you. Like a quick snippet that goes at the bottom of the email like, hey, how happy are you with the level of care support we've been doing for you guys? For an example, when I'm actually working on this, and I know this email is about the lab report which is assigned to the cash. And when I'm working on the email, I have an option here to just simply ask my patients if they are happy with the level of support. So it will just go like a quick snippet something like, you know, how happy with the seven level of support? OK, let me just simply turn this on. So basically, it would show like a quick snippet at the bottom of the email. So it does not show up clearly. I don't know what's wrong.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Yeah, but I got it because I've seen it in some emails. So it's.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  yeah. Let me show you the support inbox and I picked the email and, you know what? Even if you look at it, this negative sentiment is like looking at the tonality of the email. If a customer is irate, it would literally tag that email for you. And you can just simply see how many frustrated customers do we have versus the neutral customers? How many first responses are overdue? We are delayed. The response, this email is yet to be worked upon. So we are OK with it. And I open the email. What is the email context? I can go ahead and, you know, simply converse, you know, do a summary of the conversation. If somebody wants to know what's happening, you can share the email. You can share the ticket id with your colleagues. Also replying to an email is super simple and that's what I was referring to. You know, inserting a customer satisfaction. So it could be something like how happy are you with the level of support? Would you like to recommend our services to other friends and peers in your circle? And then you can just say, yes, no, maybe also. And then in the reports, you can literally learn the reports on how happy your patients are with the support you're offering.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Yeah. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I think as a first step, what we need to find out is that since everybody has a common shared password today because they don't have individual logins, David, I would like to understand, are you open to creating their individual inboxes? Because that's a must. If we, if we create their individual inboxes only, then we can set up hiver onto their individual accounts. And the shared mailboxes are going to be the one which are the shared inboxes here. And you choose whichever representative needs to be a part of your health care inbox or, your, you know, patients inbox, or your labs inbox, your info inbox. And from there onward, you would see the shared emails, the collaboration. Yeah.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  I think we will have to discuss internally if we need, because I understand the value of dividing it because like as you said, like dividing it in single inboxes, means I can track what every single individual.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is doing and only then you will be able to assign conversations to the right people because then we are looking at the ownership model, right? Yeah. But on.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Another side, like right now, I don't know if we really need to track it because like we would need like to like for example, the phone team is working together right now. So we don't strictly need to track that. Jasmine replied to three emails and you replied to just one. For example, right now, we don't need it. But I understand the potential. So I think we will have to talk about it inside. And like I would ask you just to give us the pricing that would be to use those features that you showed us like the AI summary and the forwarding, like I would say for both the cases. So like for just five accounts and 15 accounts depending on how we are handling it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I would say sure, absolutely, yeah, pricing is super transparent on our website. So even if you look at, we can start with the growth plan and this plan lets you deliver inbox management for 10 people. And this could be for two mailboxes, care at the rate and info at the rate or, you know, foreigners at the rate. So you can have this for two mailboxes, it can help you compose emails, summarize emails, and then you have the shared email inbox, automatic assignment on basis of it and basic reporting, also rule based assignments. So this is not set to.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  And also the integration with notion here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Integration with notion works under the copilot. So this is a second level plan which is a pro plan for 65 dollars. So this gives you a little more depth of AI agents, AI copilot. So notion comes, with this shared inbox setup. All right now, I get it. You can even have David at Gmail. Com as a shared user. Like even if you want to just use Gmail com accounts, that's also possible with hiver, you don't have to have, you know, like the entire and the company domain email address because I understand it takes extra amount for us to create individual inboxes, but even if that, if that's the case, David, and you say, hey, I am I'm going to spend extra to, you know, create individual Gmail accounts. We can always go ahead and look at how much is it even costing you maybe 10 euros or 12 euros, I believe per login and, we can subtract that, from the costing as well like I'm flexible to look at. If that happens to support you, I'm open to look at if I can just do discount and take care of that costing.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Okay, perfect. All right. I think that's it. I don't know if Jasmine have other questions?

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  I'm fine. Thank you. I think you just said before what I wanted to, about the shared accounts. So I think that's all from my side as well. Okay. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. And when can we reconnect to understand what your feedback is? Maybe we can connect on Friday if that's okay, just for 10 minutes on the same time?

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Yeah. Well, I don't know, let me check my calendar.

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  I think we should discuss this with the CEO first. Yeah, once we can give him a summary, and then I think next week we can give you an answer on that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. You can have a discussion internally. I will share the recording of our meeting and a lot of customers from the healthcare domain as to how they've been using hiver and we can plan to reconnect on third of February around the same timing for just 10 minutes to see what the feedback is.

Sándor Jázmin (jazmin.sandor@firstmedcenter.com):
  Yeah, sure. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right, great.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Yeah, yeah, sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm extending the meeting invite to you for third of February. And like I said, David, pricing is the last bit. I'm worried about. It is an easy task for us. All we want to first of all, understand is if you're open for a little change of your workflow where you're logging into individual accounts and have a shared mailbox management so that, you know, there is a complete transparency visibility and the ownership on these accounts. Now, if that's the case and if you're saying hiver looks expensive, I'm open to talk about it. I'm open to look at what the best pricing would look for. You. Don't worry about the pricing as long as I want to make sure this helps you. And this is a scalable solution, just not for today or month or two months down the line. If you're looking at a solution you're looking at for years to come because it's not easy to change solutions and, you know, all right. So, I have sent you guys an invite for third of February just for 15 minutes at the same time. Please feel free to accept it whenever you have a moment. I'll share the recording of our meeting today, right after this call. Have a discussion with CEO, come up with more questions. Happy to help. I'm just an email away from you guys.

Davide Maggiorelli (davide.maggiorelli@gmail.com):
  Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
