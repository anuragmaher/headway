Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  hello?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good afternoon. How are you? I'm.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  good. How are you? You? Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well, thank you. No complaints at all. Thank you for joining in.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Yeah, no problem at all. Good to meet you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good to meet you too. All right now, before we begin talk about business, let me quickly introduce myself. This is the very first time we're catching up. My name is Rakesh. And I take care of sales at hiver for the UK as well as the european territory. I've been with the company for over four years, personally, go on board more than 500 teams. We'll be your point of contact today. Run the show, look at your needs and see if this is a good fit and good product that you're looking at towards the end.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Perfect. I appreciate it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Do you want to give me some idea what made you look at hiver? How did you hear about us? Little excited to know about you guys?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Yeah, for sure. I mean, I'll give you as much context as I can really. So we, we're currently in contract with eight by eight who are current contact center solution provider. We're starting to find that our needs are outpacing their capabilities for, what we really need to deliver for our customers. So, we're at this stage where I'm just doing research into what's out there, what's available? What maybe are we, you know, have we not seen over the last few years because we've been with eight by eight, how technology is developed and just see potentially what direction we could go in the future for working with a provider for the next few years to help us improve our contact center solutions. And there's a whole bunch of things that we're looking to improve. I guess how we came across you guys purely just research online research, looking at what solutions might be suitable for. We talked email, of course, email's a big pain point for us at the moment with organization. And yeah, that's it, your names came up, did a little bit of research saw there was something that appealed and decided to reach out. So, yeah, speaking with a few companies at the moment, but we are at the very early stages of understanding what is potentially out there for us.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. No worries at all. I was trying to capture the actual name of the current provider. I mean, do you want to spell that for me? Yes?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  It's.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  spelled.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  eight X8.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Number eight X. All right. And until, when are you actually tied up with their contract? So.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  That would be April 27. However there is scope to bring someone in prior to that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I see. OK, I mean, is that general in your company that we do like a longer contract for yours?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  So the two year contract is the longest we would do. I think for us at the time of signing that it was, you know, security and a few things.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  A few things have come up since then that have kind of made us realize that perhaps we need to look elsewhere as well. And it's mostly to do with the email integration and the difficulties that we've actually had. There's been some service concerns as well if I'm being completely honest, some things that we're not comfortable with but also from our side because we know our lead times on getting development, our development team involved and we need to start planning now to be able to get this stuff on the roadmap for them because we try and do everything internally when it comes to that kind of thing.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. All right. And when it comes to managing the support, what are the different modes of communication through which your customers contact you? I get it. Email is the one which is important and painful. But do we also get contacted on chats? Whatsapp text, messages, phone calls or things like that?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Yeah, but it's very fragmented. So we have telephony, which eight by eight are kind of key center… for dealing with those calls. We've got text services but it's mostly outbound campaign. So we don't have two way services. Whatsapp, we've trial, but we've not had a lot of that. So it's been a lot more complicated for us to use whatsapp because there are certain business restrictions over here which have made it hard for us to have a business account. And then, yeah, email as well. So, but effectively the basics, yeah, we've got a, very basic web chat service which is effectively just a rerouting service for email. And so I mean, ideally that would be something that could be potentially be looked at as a new implemented service for us.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. So basically, it all boils down to the email way of managing client requests because, that's the major part of it like that's what is the most used channel as a support today?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Yeah, I mean phone and email. They're probably pretty equal to be honest. It's just that our email management is far behind where our telephony is.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And what telephony do you use today? I mean by eight or is there another voip provider?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  No, it's a soft, it's a soft phone through eight by eight. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. All right. Fair enough. Now, will I hear your request? I could see, there are good potential that we can assist you with management organization of your data. I mean, of course, the email and conversations along with the phone call, something that I also do want to be, very honest. Telephony is something that we're already building and that will be out by quarter of one next year. So we do not have the integration with telephony at the moment. But within the Gmail, I mean, sorry, the outlook setup, the one that you already have for your shared email accounts. We should be able to set that up in hiver assist you with that. Now, apart from that, you could still see the different functionalities like hiver is automatically helping you tag the conversations. They are assigning conversations to your agents in your team, is able to reply to contextual conversations through AI copilot, and everything that's all right there.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, at this point in time when you're saying the contract with these folks are already until January, I mean, you said 27, right?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, do you want me to kind of give you a quick walkthrough now? Or would that be better we connect towards the later part of it when you're more nearly?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  I've been given the okay to have these conversations in the knowledge that we may well bring something in before that. So like especially for the email piece, if there's something there that we can make use of, then it's not like I'm going to say cool. I'll call you back in 12 months time like we could start working on this pretty quickly, okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And how big is your support team today? If I can know, so.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  We've got 45 in the front line so that's split between email and telephone.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how much do we pay to these eight X folks? I mean, just a ballpark number. I don't want to go into the billing eight by eight per.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  License off the top of my head. I think it's like 90 pound per seat per month, something along those lines. And then we've got add ons and stuff like that with them, for… our support functions. And then actually a lot of stuff that we're not really getting too much use out of.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Wow. That's expensive though. I mean, if you ask me, 90 pounds is equivalent to say around 100 105 dollars. We bill in usd and our highest, which is the enterprise… plan. The elite one is 75 dollars. Right? So, we are definitely looking at the economical solution.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But something, that I do like I said, telephone is something that we are still building and it should be out by the first quarter. But what I'm going to do today is to give you a quick glance of what hiver has to offer and of course, we can reconnect and assist you with the setup. Maybe you can test it, invite a couple of your folks and everything. Now, if you notice it's a web interface app, hiverhq. Com, everybody is going to be logging into and I'm using my actual logins from outlook. So this is my outlook test credentials that I've used to log in into hiver, one time activity. I have connected my personal inbox on the top. So any email sent to Oliver at the rate company domain, you would see that personal inbox here. And should you not want to connect the personal inbox, it's absolutely subjective. You can always go ahead and disconnect it. A couple of my customers want that they stay in one interface, manage their personal emails on the top and the shared emails. This is where the support emails will actually come in right inside the mailbox here. Now, this is a shared inbox setup in hiver which is connected to your existing workflow. So you must have all of these different group inboxes in your outlook workspace. We're going to be just using the email address connected in hiver. That would still remain as it is. There's no disruption to your existing workflow. You can still log in into your master outlook account. But with hiver, you have one interface to manage all your support queries coming in here. Now, from here onward, you will have the new emails coming in. You would see the slas running on the emails, unattended conversations will go to the unassigned the ones which are not been allocated to anybody in the team. No ownership on there. I go to mine section to see all the tickets and the requests that I have to work on it. From a support team perspective. Now, I open the email, let's say this customer is asking for things not working. I've got hiver, AI if it is a complicated or a long chain or think of different threads to the chains. So I can go ahead and summarize the conversation, helping me save a lot of time, of course. Decode a lot of conversation. I can save this as a note. And now let's say if this needed to be reassigned to somebody else because this is more technical in nature, I can go ahead and use the ownership option. So I have all my folks here in the team floating right here in the owner's section, then are the status by default, we deal with all the emails that brand new requests into the open because you're going to be working on it. Pending is somewhat that you would use it for on hold like you're not resolving it immediately. Need some time. It's an escalation to L2 team or maybe engineering is working on it. So I can use this pending. And automatically, I can just say tag these conversations because this is something to do with the L1 or L2 or whatever, right? I mean, we could just tag the conversations why we've kept that in pending. Apart from that, we have got these custom fields. Now, this can be very subjective to how you want to organize your data. I mean for now, just an example could be email priority. You know, this is a high priority shipping status. I mean, okay. Now, think about a proper E commerce, but you're not let's say if this is more to do with any dropdown, any category of email that you deal with today, right? I mean, what sort of loan processing request is this? Is this a documentation? Is this a final reimbursement? Is this something to do with… documentation verification? So you've got all of these full, I mean dropdowns to organize the data. And the activities here would actually help me talk to my colleagues internally. If I want to talk to Cole and say, hey, Cole, can you look at this one? Can you approve of this? This is where I can go ahead and even, you know, talk to my colleagues internally. The best thing is that hiver refrains for you to forward emails to each other. You don't have to do that. If I'm replying to a customer request, I'm simply writing it to the customer. I don't have to keep the entire universe in CC. That's not needed at all. Now, most of my customers would say, hey, we keep a lot of people in CC because that's when everybody would be aware. But no, if they're added to the mailbox as users, they would see the complete transparency and I don't have to keep anybody in CC from my support team. Emails can go out from your support inbox, or if that's be a need. Your individual engineers or support folks can also use their personal email addresses to send emails out, but that would still route through the same shared inbox as such. I can have signatures at the bottom. And then I've got email templates for repetitive nature of queries and questions. Then I have hiver AI compose to kind of improvise on whatever the template has been written. And this co pilot is actually cherry on the crank where you receive repetitive nature of queries. So I can ask hiver to draft a reply for me. And this is actually directly linked with the hiver AI knowledge source. So if I go ahead in the knowledge sources now, you might have some self help today where you have the faqs uploaded and everything. You could go ahead and use this, add the snippets, add the documents where all the questions are there. And on basis of contextual response, hiver will be able to help you, your agents draft these responses for you. And that's where you would just quickly verify and send those across. Now, second thing in the team section, I want to find out how many emails are right there which are allocated to the team. You see all the email requests in the team section, the ones which are already assigned to folks, these little tags will tell you the context about what these emails are all about. And these red tags are the resolution overdue. This is resolution done in time. These are still yet to be resolved by tomorrow. So you've got these slas running that you can always set it up. You have got choice to set up different slas for different emails like regular slas for four hours, urgent VIP customers, no more than two hours billing issues, refund or cancellation requests, right? Immediately. In 30 minutes, you can have probably, you know, multiple such tags and escalations on basis of these different SLA policies… the requests that are already done. And you have closed the conversations, these move into the closed bucket. And every user in your team has access to closed. The ones which are pending, like I said will go to the pending on hold stage for you guys. Apart from that, you can always create a customized views. Let's say if you have a team of 45 people to work on just the escalations. So they would create a view for themselves called escalations. And this is exactly how it would look like. I mean, you see the filter here emails which are assigned to anybody has a status but contains a tag. So these emails are very particular emails about the escalations, that you can move into the view called escalations. So that I don't care about anything else. I just simply go into the escalations. Every day, I work on all of these escalations, so that's how, I could, you know, create these views. I have different folders for the customers, just like how you use folders, you can use hybrid tags for these folders by the way.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  OK.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any questions on the interface? I know we are not too much deep into the product for now.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Perfect. Yeah, no, this is really good. I mean, I've made some notes already. I just wondered about the tagging. Do you have any proactive tagging or is it purely a manual task to tag everything?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it would be, it would be out. We are already testing on beta. Let me, I mean, do you mind if I share my Gmail screen and show you the exact context of what we are replicating in outlook?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Yeah. Go for it. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I just don't want to confuse you. Hence, I do want to share that with you first of all, OK, inside the admin panel for Gmail, tiber, AI, and then you have got tagging, right? So you configure the tags and let tiber know as, and when you receive emails with these context, tiber start to tag automatically. So you've got the AI tagging by the way. And if I could show you a quick example in the support inbox, not only tagging hiver is absolutely able to extract the context of the emails. Also for an example, what's the summary of the context? So primary issue is additional of 15 licenses. So if you notice this, so this is a summary extract from the AI. This is AI tag already. So you're getting to see hiver is sent and analyzing your neutral or happy customer sentiments. Also. Yeah. So I could see the AI tagging happening already in Gmail. But, for outlook customers, I mean the setup is right there. We're just doing the beta test under the summarizer, compose you'll also see the AI tagging right here. So that'll be out.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  And, and then I guess like kind of moving away from the interface, what's your post interaction analytics? Like what do you have in the background that, we can see?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Actually a lot, I mean, it's entire module itself. I mean, given 30 minutes would be less. If I were to explain how vast the analytics would be. You go ahead, search for your support inbox, select the date range and look at workload conversations and report on performance. Now, this is everything by the way. For all your agents, for all your tickets that are happening into your team, when you dig deeper and see, you want to particularly understand the user level report, you go into the user section, see assigned emails versus emails sent out of these users. And now that you want to know what Rakesh is up to in last 90 days, this is the exact data that you could see. Yeah. Now different category of tags because hiver AI is able to tag these conversations for you bucket them up. Now, you want to find out what's happening into these emails. Can we understand with regards to the escalations, what exactly are we doing? How long are we doing taking to reply? And what are these number of conversations in it? The ones which are not been resolved under the SLA tags? Do we see the reports on first response violations where we haven't been able to close the resolution violations? Now, if I analyze it further and understand what this category of email was all about, I could go ahead and group it by tag and I would tell you that, hey, this category of email accounts, payable emails, account receivables or escalations have been the most resolution violated emails. Now, I know where exactly. We need more trainings.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Yeah. Okay. That's.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  great. Apart from that, you customize the reports. These are all the variables available for you. And then you could see all of that is possible. I mean property name. These are the custom fields. By the way you can even run reports or customize the reports on properties which are custom field properties for you.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Okay. And can you download and extract the raw data behind that as well?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. In the analytics section, when you export it, you could get an option to export it in the CSV for now.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Okay. Perfect. Select.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The date range, select the exact variables you require or you do not require all of that is possible. Dashboards are something which is even like a cherry on the cake. I would say, let's say I want to look at what Oliver cares the most and you create your dashboard, see all the new coming in conversations into support inbox, you want to group it by the status. So you could see what's happening on everyday basis on a dashboard, you could create your dashboard as well?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  And is this done on an individual or group basis? So, can I set this up for a set of managers or would they have to each do this individually?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You could go ahead and share it amongst everybody in the management in case you want to give, by the way individuals, when you say that you are not going to give the admin access to the agents, right? Agents would not want.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  To see that happening? No, of course. Not.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, you could choose to create it for yourself, share it with a team or just keep it just for yourself. So all of that is possible depending upon whether you're giving the admin rights to the other folks in your team?

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Understood. Okay. Brilliant.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Setup is straightforward. You go into the admin setup, you create the shared email inbox, choose which type of email address is there by the way we support everything even if it's a distribution list or a user account on a mailbox, shared inbox. There is zero difference in the setup. So you could just choose to do that, then add users to the mailboxes, and then you've got everything running right in the support inbox, that's where you would turn on the auto assignment. If you're dealing with a huge volume of emails, say, hiver allocates these emails to the people online and people can actually control their availability for emails right? From here. I mean, you can even choose to have the access or retain it. By the way, just be online, start to work on these slas, right? From here, set up the SLA policies. Very much straightforward. I would say.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  How long would you say the normal time to full adoption is when someone brings you on board?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Considering your team size of let's say, I've onboarded teams in no more than a week actually depending upon how quick your team is for the onboarding calls. Now, if we happen to have one call with one team every day? It doesn't take more than a week and a half, at least, I would say, you know, that's the fastest onboardings, I would do. Typically, I don't think it is a matter of a couple of weeks. I mean, not beyond it.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  And then what would be the key obstacles that you might face then for setup? Because I'll give you an example of something that we've come across that's been a bit of a problem. We've tried to set up emails on eight by eight. They do have a service for it. We've had some problems because of the level of security that our inboxes have from our side. So, have you come across those problems where people have tried to link inboxes and it's been a difficulty?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, there's only one caveat I can think of and that has been a little prominent when it comes to dealing with financial institutions by the way we work with capital one as a bank. So as long as there are no restrictions for a third party application to be installed, this is just a white labeling from the administrative control at your side. There is as such no challenge. I would say all you need is to be able to access the shared inbox since you are a part of it and no it restriction. And that's pretty much it. What I would still want to do is right after this meeting, send you a quick guide on our security and privacy parameters. So there's a quick document. I would send that across to you. The terms of service, and everything that talks about security and privacy policies, go over that once and let me know if you have any more questions. But apart from that, I don't find any other challenges with regards to the setup.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Okay, brilliant. Brilliant. Yeah, obviously very keen to hear about how your telephony journey goes as well because like given the timeframe, there's a chance that if this is a solution that looks good to us, we may be able to be an early adopter of that as well. So, yeah, perfect. I really appreciate it. Everything looks pretty straightforward and nice. I like the familiarity because it does just look like a Gmail port, which I mean, in the nicest way possible, which is good because I think people would be familiar with it. So, yes, brilliant to see that stuff. I appreciate it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Thank you, Oliver. And who all are you looking at the moment? I mean, just curious, maybe I can help you with the comparison.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  So, with who else are we looking at? Sorry, did you ask? Yeah. So I mean, I've got meetings with Hubspot front. Mediatel… had one other this week. Can't remember the name of them puzzle as well. Okay, Norwegian company. So, yeah, they're the businesses I've looked at so far next week. I'm going to the contact center, conferencing… London XL. So I'll have a look around there, but yeah, just initial conversations. I haven't even had demos from a lot of those guys yet. So they're still to come understood.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. What I would love to do is be in touch with you, share the information as much as possible so that it helps you. And as in when we come out with telephone integration, I'll be the first person to reach out to you by then. If you happen to make a decision. Well and good, of course, we'll still be connected as friends. Else we'll help you with the test setup and see if things go right, if that's the case. We'll collectively make a business case for the management and look at if there is a way to buy back the contract as well. And we have done that in the past as well. We can even look at it if there's a way to, you know, look at the buyback contract. But that's something you know, which is secondary for now. Primary is to make sure hiver does tick all the boxes. And for now, let me get back to you with when we connect with the telephony and get back to you on that.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Yeah, that's great. But yeah, send over that documentation that's brilliant, but I appreciate your time and yeah, food for thought. I really appreciate that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Thank you, Oliver. It was lovely catching up with you. I wish you best of luck and enjoy the rest of your day and good weekend ahead.

Oliver Smith (o.smith@loans2go.co.uk):
  Yeah, you too. All right. I'll speak soon. Thanks Rakesh. Bye bye.
