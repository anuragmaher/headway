Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  hi, Cole. Good morning. Hey.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  What's going on huseni, how are you?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Good, good. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. I appreciate you hopping on the call here today.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah, yeah, thank you. Just.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  To set a quick agenda, you know, we'd love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role. What got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions at next steps.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yes, sure. Sure. So, I'm working as a freelancer for Lucinda green XC academy. So it's an online sports academy where we sell courses with the name of Lucinda green. She is one of the greatest cross country horse rider. So basically, we are running this after post covid and it's been around for five years and we have around 1,000 members on board and we sell other products courses in between. So we basically use Gmail for the support system, the email part. But, and we were missing some of the emails because of like there was the customers, lot of queries kept on coming about the courses, then some part on the cancellation, some tech issues, etc. So we were using helpdesk from last six to eight months, I believe. But we were exploring a better tool. If we can have like on helpdesk, what is happening is our emails are getting forwarded to the helpdesk, and we don't have those in our inboxes those emails. So now we wanted to leverage gemini or some other ais who sits directly on our inboxes. And if we get some tool which can help us just organize the tickets, like which are the, what are the queries? Etc? So we can resolve it quickly. And I think like there will be easy redrafting using an AI. So all those features we are exploring.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, is it like a general mailbox that people are reaching out to that you want to manage better? Or what does that look like today?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah. So we have two Gmail accounts on those like we, one is for the members exclusively where all the members reach out and one is in a general email inbox. Where people reach out for general queries.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many people are working through those email communications?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Generally, one or two at a time? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  One or two people total on these customers. So it's.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  not a big team. Yeah, but we are scaling and if we add another clients then I think we will have more inboxes to manage. And we will have to add people.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So taking a look at my screen here, you know, huseni, what's nice about hiver is, you know, we are a certified Google partner. You know, you'll log in to hiver with your normal Google account. And then on the left hand side, you're going to have your personal inbox, you know, your normal Gmail view and then those shared inboxes below as an organization. So think customer success, shared mailbox, finance, shared mailbox, healthcare, I'm going to click into the finance one here and it opens up some sub views to help manage the intake. So the first one assigned new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be delegated, the next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me. And then there's the team view. So understanding, you know, what are both of those people currently working on? What's outstanding and what needs to be completed? Want to pause here? Any questions so far?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  No, no. You can go ahead. Like only thing is we don't have a bigger team. So like based on our requirement, if you can give me a like how we can use it, your tool yep.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, first couple things, right? We can assign a conversation. In this case, I'm going to assign to myself and the team. Now, I'm going to follow up. We can then track the status whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring no emails slip between the cracks, and that we're working through these conversations to a resolution… adding tags for organizational purposes. You said you want the ability to organize well, this is where you're going to be able to do that by leveraging these tags to send the conversations to specific buckets folders or views. And then we can also leverage these tags to trigger automations. And we can also provide analytics on the back end with these tags to understand why are people reaching out? What are the hot topics or trends we're facing amongst the team?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay. So how will you be doing this tagging? Like it's all these departments or like issues you have categorized here?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it can be done either via automations by creating rule based automations, where it's like new conversation comes in with billing in the subject line. Let's automatically apply the tag billing. But then we also have an AI mechanism on our top tier plan in our elite package which allows you to automatically categorize these leveraging AI. So understanding the intent through AI analysis and then adding the tag based on what the prompt thinks.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay. Got it. And.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then the last couple of things here, right? Are the collaboration aspects. So being able to collaborate internally… I'll send this notification to Jeevan, he'll receive that notification up top. He can then click on it. It'll take him right to this thread where we can keep having this back and forth conversation in the notes section. And then we have that ability to leverage our AI co pilot to draft replies. And this actually leverages your data sources, your information to search through to draft a reply more efficiently and effectively.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay. So this will like we'll look at how we are responding earlier. And based on those, our… previous replies, it will draft or we'll have to train this or, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So it's a combination of it'll, be trained and also, you can feed it information to draft responses.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And yeah, so that's essentially the flow though. What are your thoughts on this so far?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah, it looks simple because it will be sitting inside our Gmail inbox. Yeah, this tool. Yeah. Sorry. And if we have two mail accounts then how will that work? You?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Just have to set them up in the admin panel, right? So go to the admin panel here. All you have to do is go to shared inboxes, create shared inbox, and then you log in and authenticate it. And then from there, it'll live in the Gmail on the left hand side with these yellow tinted inboxes and everyone will have visibility.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  A typical and I'm happy to set you up with a trial right now. If you wanted to, I can help you get up and running with a trial right now, if that works for you.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay. But if you are using like we are on a plan on this help desk. So all of our emails are getting forwarded there. So how can we migrate to this one?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  What's the help desk you're using now?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  The help… desk powered by text that one?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So we don't have any migration information on that, but you can start trialing this if you want to get set up and get a feel for it. I can help kick it off now or whatever makes sense.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah. If you can… like show me which plan will work for us suggest. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, I recommend the growth plan. It's 25 dollars per user per month on an annual basis. And that's 35 dollars per user per month on a monthly basis. This should suffice for the two users that you have. No.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay, great. I think we are spending in similar way for this headless also. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, would you want me to help you get set up with hiver? That's something that I can offer right now, if you want me to help you get up and running with it?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Will it impact our existing those ticketing system or? No?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, because it's Gmail native, it won't impact anything going on your current ticketing?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  No. Okay. So, yes, we can, then I think we can try it out. Yes. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):

  Okay. So now, see how memberships now on the left hand side, see below the demo inbox all the way left. So now you can view that mailbox there… as conversations start to flow in historical emails. Won't be coming in, but new emails will be. Now, we do have the ability to import historically. If you'd like… I think click on the admin panel, top right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):

  Okay. And I would give them admin access too, so they can have access to everything. You could change their role by clicking on member in the middle… change user role. Perfect. Yeah, admin. So they'll now have that full access to hiver. Awesome. So, and then go back out to the Gmail. So if you click on the membership inbox, click… on any of those emails for an example in the unassigned section… and see on the right hand side. Now, we have the tracking capability… on the way, right hand side, you'll see the assignments assigned to status. Okay? So that gives you that ticketing functionality within Gmail.

How much user friendly it is, and if it's solving our purpose, the main, our concern was like if we're email stays in the Gmail account, so that it's easy, like we are using a lot of gemini and, yeah, and that is like connected with our inboxes. So it, and we have trained the Gmail to like gemini to draft our emails. So, yeah, we want to test it. Okay? And.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  If you want to also add your other mailbox, just go to the admin panel.
