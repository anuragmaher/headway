Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hit''next''.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  with the same name? Okay. No worries. Just cross this, pop up here… and click on''create shared inbox'' on the right. And we'll create the other one from here for now and we'll look into that later name, the other inbox info, connect this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Hit next.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is done as well. Likewise, we'll create the third one as well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So these are done. There are only three, right?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Just having a look.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We can anyway, just create three in this plan. The limit of three?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Can you only create three on this plan?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Like the growth plan allows you to have three shared mailboxes?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  In terms of the users currently, you have added one more. So we have in total two, you can add three more whenever you wish to.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Just looking at our groups now… might have to rethink this because.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Got other… ones here that I actually used to have because we were on the pro plan.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay. I'll just have to try upon some workarounds for the other ones. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Mentioned three mailboxes yesterday, right? Are there more that you want?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  To, you know, I didn't realize we actually have more. These are the three main ones.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. How many of these are like in total?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  So, I've got emails at story ktr, which is an important one. It's a new one that we've been using.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  There is source at story ktr, which is what our website triggers for all our quote requests.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Then we have.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  HR at story ktr. So that's another three. And then we've also got subscriptions… at thriftedbystory ktr, and yaga, at thriftedbystory ktr, and hello at thriftedbystory ktr.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, how many are these in total?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. And for nine, I think pro will also not suffice since pro has a limit of five. So, in that case, if, in case you want to accommodate all these, you'll have to look at the elite plan, which is priced at 75 dollars per user per month.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yeah. Can't afford it?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What you can do in that case, you can also use the other group email addresses as like put a forwarding address to that and forward those emails to these because it's the same team members, right? Who are handling these today. So, instead of creating different mailboxes, you can use this approach wherein you put a forwarding address so that all your emails gets forwarded. Let's say if they're written at hello at the rate to support at the rate, right? And then in hiver, you can create a separate tag called hello at the rate, wherein you can keep all the emails which are coming from or addressed to, hello, at the rate should be part of that tag.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, likewise. You can accommodate for now or if your budget increases at any point at that point, you can consider, you know, upgrading as well.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Cool.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay. What is next?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So now, you have set up the shared mailboxes, so you can start using it since you have already used it in the past as well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So you can create tags and do different things in order to make sure that the workflow is achieved as how you want. Currently, it shows these warning signs. You can ignore that your mailboxes are getting synced from the past emails. So it's just gonna take some time and then it'll be up and running.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cool. Yeah. Anything specific that you want me to help you with? Kris? I'm happy to walk you through that.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Let's do a Shopify integration.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Go to the admin panel… go to integrations.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  I'm gonna have to do that as well, I think.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. On the left, you see integrations. Yeah, here, you have your Shopify. Are you the admin on Shopify?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you just have to follow these steps. You can just start setup. You just have to get the API from there from the settings in Shopify, you just have to fill these columns and it'll be done.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay. So, I need to put an app in here.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, you don't have to do this. You have to find the API that it's asking for first, you have to put the shop name, you can follow that article which is attached there in hiver.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, you see Shopify help article on the right?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Oh, sorry.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  I think… I should be able to figure it out.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it's like you just have to put the details here at the end. Once you have configured it, you will get a code. You just have to copy that code and put it on your website on Shopify. And that's it, your chat will be live as well.
