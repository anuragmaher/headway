Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Carla.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  Hi, good morning.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Morning. How are you?

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Doing well, doing well, can't complain… but I appreciate, you know, you hopping on the call here today. Thank you for taking.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  The time.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So just to set a quick agenda for, you know, the structure of the call, I would love to start, you know, with a quick round of introductions, understand, you know, your role, what got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demo, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps, okay?

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  I actually got the demo. If I'm not mistaken about two weeks ago. I've been out on vacation for a little bit so, but I had, his name was Rakesh. I can actually look up the email.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, I actually see it right here. Yeah.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  So, I did it with my personal email. We basically, and at that time, what we actually wanted to set was somewhat of a better sorting system. We currently have Freshdesk. And for what we're aiming to do in the future, it's just not going to be… well an effective platform.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  So, I went over most of the details with Rakesh over like about the system, the one issue we had, we were doing the 14 day trial period and we got charged the full year. That was actually the inquiry my boss had.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Let me try to see if I can bring in Rakesh here because I just don't have the contacts that he has. Let me just slack him real quick and see if he can hop on the call one second.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  I do have, I know you were added, I was actually added to the thread a little later myself, but basically, my boss that's Percy, he was going back and forth with the service team because, yeah, we were actually, the trial period was supposed to end today. It's just, we got charged the full amount without, you know?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. So this is you just trying to get that like refund back, right? Yeah.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  Basically, we are interested in the product that's something. We actually do want to do it's just, you know, we were trying to set up the mapping, well, the routing for, you know, all the different emails and, you know, we thought we would have some extra time to be able to set that up.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  Also. We didn't really get a chance to set it up monthly. I know it is a few bucks. It's a little cheaper to do it annually. But just again, we're kind of trying this out. So we were just looking into options.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I think what I'll do here is actually I'll see you in a conversation with Rakesh after this and he can help square away, you know, the billing issue as well as extending out the trial, but I guess you still have access to it since you did pay for the solution right right now. Like you're still able to test and things of that nature. Yeah. Okay, cool. So why don't I do this? Yeah, I'll see you in a conversation with Rakesh for you to book a meeting with him and kind of hash all this stuff out a little bit further.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  Okay. Let me give me just a second. I'm trying to follow the thread here. I don't know.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  Okay. Again, I was added on Tuesday, so I have here yourself. I'm sorry if I'm butchering this kirthi or kirthi?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, kirthi.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  So the thing is when I did my demo with Rakesh, I was using my email. The Isla viva group was going to be basically like the master email for that. So I'm not 100 percent sure if like Rakesh is on the loop about this specific account. We're the same company. It's the same thing. We just, I did do the demo with my email because I wanted to see how it would go. And since I'm the one that's going to be actually testing out and just doing the routing for our customer service team. Basically, I was just taking the lead on that and then we just decided to do the master to start everything.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. So I'll give him all this context over slack so he can come prepared on the next call and help, you know, he'll get the refund. I'll reach out to my financing team about refunding you the annual commitment. Yeah.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  No. And still again, we are interested, we actually want to have hiver as our ticketing system. It's just, it kind of caught us off guard because again, the trial was supposed to end today. I had to leave last week for a few personal matters. So I hadn't been able to actually do the mapping and just, I wanted to get everything sorted before, you know, we actually did the thing, right? So my boss really like we're going to stick to you guys, but we want to do if it's possible the monthly billing, and then just if we have a chance to maybe have this same like demo space with the whole customer service and sales team since we're going to be the first team to be using it, I just want them to actually feel okay. So, you know, that they know the system. I know it's really user friendly. I tried it. It's foolproof but, you know, everyone's different and also I wouldn't just want to like hang on to this and let Freshdesk go. And then… we're a tourism company. So we really just can't afford to have a few weeks of basically everyone being lost.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, makes total sense. So, yeah, I'll work with my team on that and that's you want 10 users on the growth plan monthly. Is that way? Okay. Perfect. Awesome. So I will let Rakesh know all this. I'll also prep my billing team so we can one give you the refund for the annual and push you to the monthly.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then Rakesh will spend some book of time with you to further hash all this out as well. Perfect. Well, no, it was great to meet you, Carla. I'll follow up with you shortly and I hope you have a great weekend.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  You too. If anything again, my email is this, I work the weekends as well, so I'll be available. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Thanks, Carla.

Carla Ramos (carla@kayakingpuertorico.com):
  Have an amazing day. Cool. Bye bye.
