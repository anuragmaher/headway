Call: Hiver Follow Up with Leah
Date: 2025-11-04T23:30:43+05:30
================================================================================

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Leah. This is matt with hiver. Can you hear me? Yeah?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  How you doing?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'm doing well. How you doing?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Doing pretty good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So, yeah, I got another person here joining this call as well just to be an additional resource here. But, yeah, and yeah, since I did see, I did see that you went ahead and moved forward with the purchase, right?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  It looks like we did, yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So with that too, you actually get onboarding here with hiver. So I'm gonna also like just send you an email shortly here, introducing you to your onboarder here at hiver and, yeah, and they're gonna be able to help you with the account setup and any questions that you might have.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  That sounds great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. But yeah, I mean, I know that we had this meeting here today too, so I wanted to see if there was anything in the meantime that we could potentially help out with.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  So I was able to figure out how to turn off the auto, assigning the hiver chat. Reshma has been wonderful. She's helped me a couple of times and then… I do, so I turned off where it sends it to the inbox like my personal inbox, but… I still have things showing up there. So I'm not sure why that's happening like there'll be a whole email thread that max will reply to. I see like everything it's in my inbox, as opposed to being just in that… hiver.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah. Do you mind sharing your screen here, Leah?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Something is going off and I don't know what it is. Yep, let me share my screen.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then I have Manoj on the line as well. He's one of our solutions engineers. So.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Hi, Manoj.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Hi, Leah. Hi, max. How are you guys, how?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Are you doing pretty good? All right? Let me get in here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then just to give you some background here, Manoj, Leah did purchase. So I'm going to introduce her to her onboarding team after this call, but yeah, since we already had this call on the calendar here, I just wanted to see include you and see if there was anything that we could help out with. Before that before that, she has that call.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, got it. Got it.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay. So, I'm not exactly sure which screen I'm sharing you're.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  sharing the right one. Yeah, you're on the right one? Yeah.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  The right one? Okay. So if I go to my inbox, all of these that say me inbox should not be here. Like those are, this is my teamthrows… email address. So they should only be in the main inbox. And I did turn it off where it's not… supposed to show up in my inbox. Like it's not supposed to copy it to my inbox, but it's still showing up there.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you did turn off the copy to inbox on task assignment?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Right. Yes.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Is your personal email address included anywhere in the thread? Like in CC or BCC by any chance?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Should not be. I mean, there are a couple emails that I have been copied on and that's fine. I totally get that. But these are just ones that I'm so I'm opening and replying through our main inbox, and then they're showing up here.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's not going to be an issue. Can you open any of the email? Is Matthew's email sent to the mailbox as well?

Max:
  Yeah. So like I'm using the info at teamthrows com account. So that's where the majority of, I mean, everything's coming into. And the idea is that, you know, Leia is also seeing what I see. So we're because the thing with us, unlike a lot of other companies like, you may want it to be assigned to one person who then kind of takes over that account or thread. But with us like we could have a thread that's 45 emails long. And so we want to be able to both respond, you know, in the same thread and kind of see the same thread. Sometimes there are instances where Leia would want to assign it to me directly but, you know, we're just trying to kind of have a shared inbox, which I'm assuming is the unassigned you know, inbox. But then another thing that happens is when I respond, it seems like they become assigned to me and I just want to make sure Leia can still see them. If somebody else responds back to me, if that makes sense. Awesome.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, max, that is absolutely possible. So as soon as an email is sent to the shared mailbox, the following responses that you do on the thread will be visible to the entire team. That's why we have the team section. Like the team section is basically, you know, it's ideal to see who's working on what?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  So that's over here on the left, the team?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  So, what if we want to… keep everything in unassigned unless… assigned to someone?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  So, when they reply back, so I send an email, right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. I,

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  close it, it's not assigned to me.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  It should, when it opens, go to the main unassigned, correct?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes. Okay. Like without assignment, if you're just responding, you know, and then switching databases, it just sticks to the unassigned section only after it's assigned, it moves into the mine and the team folders.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay. And I can see everything in his folder. He can see everything in mine. Yeah. Okay, good. And I did turn max, I did turn off the auto assign.

Max:
  Oh, you did. Okay, good.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Yes, today's been lovely. Just clicking send and close. Now, another usability issue we're running into is, do you see all these team Dj ones? So we created a folder for those, right? Dj creatives, we want them and it will automatically tag them, but we want them to automatically move out of unassigned and just into Dj creatives. Is that a possibility?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So along with the action that you have to add a tag, you add another action, you know, changing it to pending or closed status… or do you get a response on these emails?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Well, those are, so max handles, those are with our designers, but we don't want them mixed in with our customer emails.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Got it. Does that make.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  sense? So we want them coming through and staying open until he handles them, but we don't want them in this main inbox either. So basically, we want our main inbox to just be every open email from a customer. And then we want to be able to set up a flow for those others, like the Dj creatives, where they move so that when he is handling those, he can go to the Dj creatives folder and just, you know, knock all of them out in a row and be done. And then that folder is clear and they never actually hit this inbox.

Max:
  Yeah, that goes as well for, like for example, those order desk, that email you see at the top like chase, you know, emails, like, there are certain emails that as they come through and they're always going to be from the same domain, right? Like the Dj creative email is always from the same sender, domain… you know, just kind of pulling those out, you know, or, yeah, sending those like she was talking about either to another folder. But is that something we do through hiver? Or is that something we do in like Gmail settings?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So the unassigned like we can't do that in hiver, but it's going to be like basically based on custom views because the unassigned section is a default view which is going to have all emails that are not assigned to anybody, right? So similar to how you have created order desk and Dj creatives, right? A suggestion is we create another custom view that's shared by all of you guys, name it as all customer emails or open customer emails as the folder. And we can set the filter in that custom view like which do not contain the Dj creative tag and do not contain the order desk tags. So when you set that up as a hiver filter to create the custom view, you can keep that on the top and remove the unassigned section as your favorite. So that.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  That should be the workaround for that, so that, you know, so.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  We can like name it work from here, right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Anything that you wish. Yeah. So basically, you're going to remove the default sections from there like unassigned mine and team and have only your custom folders as favorites. The same view, just do it in every other system, every other user. And yeah, you can just work out of that view because as soon as the reply comes in, the custom view is also going to populate with that particular email. Okay?

Max:
  Yeah, that could be better because like my issue right now is like sometimes I'm not sure if I should be in like the regular Gmail inbox or the unassigned because it seems like I always have a lot more, you know, in the, I mean it makes sense, but I always have a lot more in the main inbox than in the unassigned emails. So, yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So the inbox, you… know… things that happen guys, there are a couple of things. One is the setting that Leah disabled copy to inbox on task assignment. So until now, max, whatever emails were assigned to your email account… was all being pushed to your personal inbox, which was part of the setting, right? And there is also another setting where it says remove from inbox on reassignment, right?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. What that does is like in case like the older emails, let's say it was first assigned to Leah, and then Leah assigned it back to you. In this case, it would be visible on Leah's account as well as your account. Yeah. So that is also a setting that you can disable or see if it's enabled by any chance.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  All right. So let's go in and… what's the wrong?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  That's Gmail. Yeah.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay. I have an extra button up there now.

Max:
  Okay. So we're going to admin?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Panel?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yep, admin panel… glow to chat. Inbox is on the left. Click on your main inbox.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Settings.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  scroll down the third option. Do you see? And under advanced settings, the third one remove conversations from inbox on reassignment. Okay? Enable that.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  It's around here.

Max:
  Father's script?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay. So we move.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just to make sure let's keep this enabled. And another thing max, you mentioned that you are logging into infoad and then working on the emails.

Max:
  Yeah. So, like everything's coming into the info. Okay? And the main thing I'm just trying to avoid is like having things missed because like if Leah's you know, getting off at five, but I might be responding like I might be working until 10 PM at night, right? So, if people are responding but they're assigned to her, I just want to make sure I'm still able to see those replies and not have to wait for, you know, Leah to come back in the next day for them to be replied to. So like I just want to make sure like the auto assigning is off. That's really the main thing, you know?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Got it. So, max here's the thing, right? Since that account is connected as a mailbox as well as, you know, an account within hiver, all those responses are part of the shared mailbox, and you're still going to be able to see it right now, emails getting moved to the inbox issue is that you're actually logged into the mailbox account itself, right? And at times what happens is Gmail sees… the recipients in every email. If your logged in account, email address is present on the recipient list anywhere, right? It's going to push the email to the inbox.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  So, max, for you, they're probably all going to still show unless… you start using the max at info at teamthrows, your email. You know what I mean? Yeah. So that info is all going to show for you. Yeah, in both places.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. See, max, I would say like, you know, if you do have the teamthrows email address, I would suggest you log in from that, right? So that you have a cleaner view of the shared mailbox itself. Because right now, you would have major confusions, like you have the same emails in the inbox as well as the shared mailbox with all bunch of tags everywhere. And, you know, yeah, that is going to look kind of messy. So.

Max:
  Yeah, yeah. But when I reply to somebody else, this is the thing I tried to explain it. But just so like when I reply to somebody, should I be like, is there a difference in me replying from my main inbox, like the Gmail inbox versus the unassigned inbox and clicking send and close versus send? I'm just trying to understand all that.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No, no, it doesn't make a difference because it's just a single email in your Google account. The ones with the hiver labels are part of hiver… and the ones without the labels are just part of your Gmail account. And while responding to these emails, you can, you know, I would suggest always reply from the info at email address with your personal signature, right? Because once you start replying, use your personal address. Again, emails start coming to your inbox.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  But, yeah, it doesn't matter. You can use the Gmail send anytime if you don't want to change the status or you can just use hiver send and close or send and pending.

Max:
  Okay. When I send and close though, does it like… Leia, do you have, you don't have show on red, right? This is just all the unassigned ones. Yeah.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  These are, I can click on, do you want? Yeah, it's.

Max:
  off. Yeah. So, like when I reply send and close here, it's taking it out of the unassigned, right? It's closing it. So it doesn't show up here anymore because, oh, yeah, yeah, actually, this is one thing. So, like in my main inbox in my Gmail actually let me?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  You share?

Max:
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, share.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Screw it.

Max:
  So, for example, like this is, you know, my thing. So like, I see this as unread right? So, if I click on this, right? No, it's not, let me find one… good example.

Max:
  Oh, it's not moving.

Max:
  What I'm getting at is might… have cleared most of them out here like this one, for example, like Leia responded to this one, but it's still showing as unread in my main inbox, right? It wouldn't be an unassigned. But basically, it's not like when she's replying.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Yeah, it's not disappearing from the inbox when it's sent and closed replied to and closed. It's not like removing from our inbox. It's still there. So, like when I came in today, I had a bunch of emails in my personal inbox that had all been replied to and closed by max last night.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So, for max, it's not going to go away because as I mentioned, he's logging into infoad the personal address. Is there, the hiver status is not going to overrun Gmail's you know?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Way of.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Working that's one thing. And the second thing, the red status is not going to sync across Gmail accounts.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Right. Because each Gmail account is again individual Gmail accounts. That is one thing. So, again, max, even if you mark the email as closed, if it has the infoad email address, it is going to be visible in the inbox, it's not going to go away from the inbox. And Leah on your account, right? Yeah, we have to check if your email address was somewhere present in that email chain or where you assigned to that email even once?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay. Let me see. Well, yeah, because we were stuck when we first started where it would assign. So I would have to send an email, let it assign it to me, unassign it from me and then close it.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. I think it should be because of the settings, but moving on, you shouldn't have a problem. And even if it's assigned while replying to the email guys, you do have an option called send close and unassigned so that it doesn't come back to you, the new replies come back into the unassigned section anyways.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Where is that?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Can you click reply? Because as far as I'm hearing that's a.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Lot of, oh, look at that.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's a lot of manual action you have been doing, Leah? Oh,

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  yeah. Yeah, it takes. So I got it too much time. Okay? But we do have this setting on there that it won't do that now? Because I turned that auto assign off max. Can you go to your inbox?

Max:
  Yeah. In hiver.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  No.

Max:
  Oh, there's this one?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  It's yours. Okay. Yeah. So, if you go into… I mean, you can click on any of them, I guess because they're all in your inbox. So at the very top with all the tags, if I go into my Gmail, and I open one of these emails, and the very first tag says inbox, if IX that off, will it not come back to my personal inbox again?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  It will not come back unless your email address is going to be present.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Perfect.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, because you can see guys, you can anytime use Gmail's archiving option because it simply removes the inbox label and it's not going to affect the shared mailbox in any way.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  So, I can remove that and then trash the message from my inbox.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No trashing, archiving, trashing will get it removed from the shared mailbox. Oh,

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  okay. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, you simply select all the emails and then click on the archive icon on the top and everything is going to move away from your inbox.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay. All right.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And even the send close and undersign option in case, if you want to use that, right? As soon as you use it once the system is going to remember, and that is going to be your default option, moving forward, you don't have to manually change them every time.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay. All right.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  So, minaj, I do have another question for you, yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, please.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  And this is a techie question. Okay. So, when I'm answering an email, when I get to the bottom of the little box, where I can type my response in my whole page starts moving up.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  What is it? You mean? Like how you're saying it? Yeah.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  So, start, I don't know if it'll work for you because when I click to reply to an email, I don't see my signature line, see it. Oh, your,

Max:
  signature? Yeah, I've noticed your signature. Like sometimes it doesn't come through with this. Sometimes it comes, you know, like,

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  okay. Okay. So, signature, we can check in your Gmail settings. It's a user base. So, max, can you go to your Gmail settings once? Let me just quickly show you the gear icon. Yeah, see all settings scroll down to the signature part right… now for new emails you have said, used, use my signature, right? Yeah.

Max:
  So,

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  simply, just select the both… select based on. So if you click on the drop down, do you see my signature? Yeah.

Max:
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  You simply choose the signature from here and it gets applied to the email. Yeah.

Max:
  On, on layers end, right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, on layers in, yeah.

Max:
  Yeah, because I think like I've seen like if, I go back, I mean, I've definitely seen your email. Let me see.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Do you mind? So I didn't see the same. Okay. So do… I click on the button that says insert signature before quoted text in replies?

Max:
  Yeah, I think that you shut off. Yeah, see right now. Well, no, that's not a… see like it's coming through like this, which isn't terrible. It's not the exact same as mine, but this is what's coming through here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, I.

Max:
  can, like, if you copy my signature should be able to paste it in. The thing is it's complicated because it's like it's not HTML, but it has like this big gif, you know, in it.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And guys just a heads up. We don't control like on the email signature part.

Max:
  Yeah. It's a Gmail thing anyway. Yeah, we can figure that one out. And I think that's more of like, well, I felt like when I was setting up my brother's email for like I was having a ton of issues with that so we can get like wise stamp or something that is more for email signatures. I'll have to look into that one. Yeah, I turn off or I turn this on insert before quoted text. I turn that off. And then I, yeah. So I would have this box checked. I'll also have on reply… forward, use, you know, whichever… one. Oh, yeah, we can talk about that one.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  But why does my screen move?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, yeah, I have to see.

Max:
  That, yeah, here. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I remember you showing that to me, Leah, basically minaj when she starts typing on an email, for some reason, her Gmail just starts shifting down.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Here, I'll use this because this is not a customer email. So. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, you're still not sharing your screen?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Oh, that'd be a problem. Okay?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay. You see my screen now?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  I'm typing, hey?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Oh, no, it's not going to do it. Really. I'm doing it all day, minaj, I promise you, so basically, when I'm typing this box here, doesn't get any bigger. It's very small.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And my,

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  signature is typically not there. So this is just a very odd situation right now. So this box.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Does.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  not get bigger. And what happens is as I'm typing every, the whole page starts moving down. So this part right here starts moving up until I can't see what I'm typing.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Understood understood. Okay. Then I get your point. So your reply box is getting stuck.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Yeah. And then it just moves the whole and I can keep typing. I just can't see what I'm typing.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Got it. Okay. So, Leah, I, it seems like, you know, sometimes when, you know, the console and the network basically when Gmail is not completely loaded or, you… know, the network slightly doesn't trigger the logs within Gmail, this might happen. But just a suggestion right now, I don't have any troubleshooting steps to be honest. But next time as soon as it happens, click on your hiver icon and go into instant chat support so that one of our support agent gets online and checks what exactly is happening.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  They'll be able to check the logs and see if it's because of hiver's extension or if it's because of any other application?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then as far as next steps go here because my team's going to ask me, Leah, which, what, which team from your side is going to be is using hiver?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  All of us all.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Of us got it. And how many people is it total?

Max:
  Well, it's, really us too for the most part for now. And that's why I just set us up with two, two accounts in the subscription, you know, two users because there's really nobody else that'll be interacting with customers day to day aside from Leah and I. So, yeah… for the time being.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Okay. Let me just, okay. So we see in the account. So… there's… so in your account, I go, it's going off based off the amount of people that you have in your account here. So we have Leah's email in there. We have max's email in there. We have Shelly's email in there, and we have Daniel's email in there.

Max:
  In, in where?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  In, in the hiver account?

Max:
  Okay. Yes. I mean, Daniel, I don't know how much longer he'll be with us. Shelly's not working right now. The max email, I'm not really going to be using. I'm probably just going to stick with the info email. Esme, I guess it could be good because one of the other things we would like to do is right now we have a lot of like design work. So when people email us for revisions, we'd like to be able to send that to the design team directly and we're doing that right now with slack and our backend, you know, yada, but it would be a lot easier if we could. I mean, I don't know Leah, if you think it'd be easier or not.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  So, Esme… you have set up as designs at teamthrows… does she do any of the Dj creatives emails? Because we could just skip the… 15 steps and have them go, have them change the email they're sending it, to design teamthrows and then everything goes there. But I don't know if that's now, if we did do that, would… we be able to parse those into, excuse me hiver in… their own that, where they would just go to designs? And we'd have that folder on the left and could pull up everything sent to designs at teamthrows?

Max:
  Yeah, just like basically with that. So like let's say we're talking to a customer, 10 different emails and like, hey, can I please change the text to maybe or whatever? So we want to send that to the design team, the design team will fix it. They'll send it whatever, but we don't want to necessarily assign it to the designer entirely because if they reply back with just a generic question again, after they get the revisions back, we want to be able to see that. So, I'm hoping there's just a, you know, a folder that they can just check, right? You can just make a folder for the designers.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  You know?

Max:
  And then they can just go in and check that and kind of, I don't know. I don't know what, the best way to do that. It's almost more like a task manager type of thing, I guess.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, max, do you mind sharing your screen with hiver open here? Yep… perfect. Yeah, because basically, yeah, when you guys purchased today, so we sell in buckets, right? And we'll get this corrected too, but basically click on the honeycomb in the upper right corner… click on admin panel… click on users and roles in the bottom left on the left hand screen bar. Yeah. Okay. Got it. So, yeah, basically, these are, this is the users in here, right? So we sell them, we sell them buckets of it goes two users, then it goes five users and then it goes in 10.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So it goes in, the minimum is two you can buy. And then it goes to five, and then it goes to 10, right? And yeah, when you purchase this morning, since you have one, two, three, four, five, six people in here, it puts you in the, it upgrades you to the 10 user bucket. So, yeah, you were charged for 10 users this morning, which of course we're going to correct it. I'm glad that we talked today to make sure that obviously wasn't correct here. So basically, what I'm saying in here is we have to make it so that it has the amount of users that you want in here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  If you do five, then you can, you know, mix and match up to five people in the account. If you only want to have two, then you can only have, you know, two people right here in the account. So that's what I'm saying we got to fix this before I reach out to our billing team to correct the payment from earlier today?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So we definitely, I mean teamthrows is our main email, is that correct?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No. So that, yeah, no, that, no, it's not considered a user. So we can actually remove that one.

Max:
  You're going to like delete these three users, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that'll do.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Well, do we want to keep design?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Design can also be like a mailbox. It doesn't have to necessarily be a user.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Okay. Can we make?

Max:
  Yeah, we'll keep?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Info, wheelboxes.

Max:
  I'm just confused. I was charged for. So I only purchased two, right? And.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, I saw, yeah, I saw the two and then, yeah, there I.

Max:
  Didn't see this, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. And obviously, that's incorrect. So we'll fix that. I'll get you on. We'll fix that today. Just want to make sure that the account it's basically like for instance, people will sign up for, you know, two users and then they add two more. So then it just basically automatically charges the card on file for it. So, I think it was just registering the six in the account, which is why I'm trying to help you fix it right now. So, so we got Leah in the account here. And then, yeah… who else was there any other individuals that you wanted to have in this account here? Or is this all the like the design team and the info email, and then, Leah?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Now, if we make info, a mailbox, is max still going to be able to use that as his email?

Max:
  Yeah, I think it'd just be the same as it is now, which would be fine.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Right. Yeah, he'll be able to go in through info to access hiver.

Max:
  Turn it up a little bit. What was it? Yeah, I mean, that's fine because like the info is kind of like, the overs it oversees all the emails anyway, you know. So, so I mainly just don't want to miss anything.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Yeah. So that's fine. That's my concern is if we change it to a mailbox as opposed to a user?

Max:
  Yeah.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Will that cause an issue Matthew?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I don't not sure. Manoj, would that cause an issue?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I mean, the user in design team?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, how it's really supposed to be like ideally, how it's set up, right? It's like the users should be, the people's names, right? So, it should be, Leah at teamthrows, max at teamthrows, and then the mailboxes should be design at teamthrows info at teamthrows… that's you know, how most of our customers have it set up? Is the users have it connected to their emails? And then the shared addresses are connected to the mailboxes?

Max:
  Yeah. But I think for now, it's fine. I think we're good. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. So you, so.

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  You want to leave, we want to turn design into, a mailbox? Correct?

Max:
  Yeah, that one?

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  And then leave info, Leah, and Shelly, correct?

Max:
  Well, not Shelly. Just, okay. Just info and,

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  Leah. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's that's totally fine. I'm going to let our, that would put you in the five user bucket. So I'm going to let our team know that it's because you can either have two, two users or up to five. So I'll let our team know that you meant to purchase the five user bucket and to refund you the other amount. Is that all right?

Max:
  Yeah, I'm not sure. So what's the cost per user? If we go to five? Just because like if we're not filling three, we're not filling all five.

Max:
  It makes more sense. I think just to do two, you know, unless we, you know, unless we really are going to use this design inbox, and we can figure out a way to make it really easy to get all the info over to our design team. But if we have to pay for five like, well, like what is it? Is it 50 per user per month?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. It's it's 55 dollars per user per month.

Max:
  Yeah. So I can just,

Leah Lewis (leah@teamthrows.com):
  give you and me for now and.

Max:
  Yeah. I think we'll just do me and Leah for now then info. And.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Delete that one. Okay? Perfect… that one.

Max:
  And then we'll figure it out. I mean, if we decide that, you know, hey, Esme, Daniel, and, you know?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Of course, we're.

Max:
  all going to be in there, then that makes sense. But yeah, for.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Now, of course, and then how it works, basically, right? So the next buck it's the five. So when you do go and add somebody, it is going to charge you into the next bucket. So just, keep that in mind there. But then you get up to five, right? So then it won't you can add people up to five. You won't get charged. And then when you go past five, you will get charged from there. But perfect. Now that you have that set up right here, I can just go ahead and let our team know and, yeah, they'll correct it. And, yeah, and then you guys should be all set and then, yeah, continue to use our support team, yeah, to help with any issues that you have. The chat. Also, you can, if you click on the honeycomb in the upper right hand corner as well, you can even instant chats right there. And then if you reach out to them and they can even get on a call with you as well, but you should be all set. Sounds good. All right. Thank you so much max. Thank you, Leah. I'll get your, I'll get your account corrected today.

Max:
  Okay. Appreciate it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks. Thank you. Bye.
