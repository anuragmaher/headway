================================================================================

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hello, everyone.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, Vitaly. How are you?

Vitaly:
  Hi. Can you hear me? I?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can hear you well, yes.

Vitaly:
  Okay. Because I had to join from the phone. I didn't get to my computer. I'm going to get there soon. No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries at all. How have you been? How was the holiday season for you?

Vitaly:
  That's pretty good. Everything is fine. Yeah, we're in the new year. So we have to start something new.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yes, for sure. Great. Perfect. I think as for our, you know, last conversation that we had, we were all done from the contract formalities point of view. We also had a discussion on certain things that you had to get done during this time, so that for us to get started.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So I just thought of getting, you know, Pavithra on call as she would be the one taking over from here and will be helping you and the team with the onboarding and all the support that is required going forward. So she will be your designated customer success manager from hivo.

Vitaly:
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, alongside Raghav who probably will join in a while, who will be handling your account as well. So, yeah, I think the agenda for today's meeting was just to introduce everyone and understand where we are in terms of the progress, how you would like to take this forward from here, just to understand certain timelines on that.

Vitaly:
  I think I haven't finished those other things for them yet. I really hope I'm going to finish this week because they have a few more employees to deal with. And after that, I will start, you know, this shared inbox, solving their shared inbox problem. So basically, I think… we can make or I can reach out to you once I'm done, and then we can set up another meeting and, you know, starting setting up the account and all other stuff.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think we can do that. Do you have any timeline like by when you are looking to go live?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Like do they have any timeline that they want to implement this by end of January or any such timeline that they have in mind for this project?

Vitaly:
  So, as I said, I have to start as soon as I finish the email and security, but I'm… not sure, but I hope it's going to be the end of this week. So if that's the case, so then probably the beginning of the next week, we can start working on this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And if I'm not wrong, we will be starting off with the accounting team, right? Like we discussed and then followed by.

Vitaly:
  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Got it. Cool.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Pavithra, if you want to take over from here, I think you can introduce yourself.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  Thank you, Yukta. Hi, Vitaly. I'm Pavithra, and like Yukta mentioned, I will be the customer success manager for taurus auto group. Moving forward. My role here will be to take care of the implementation to begin with. Now that we have accounting and dispatch team that we're looking to have to create two shared mailboxes. We will plan this out based on phases starting with accounting team. I will be taking care of the implementation. And after that, on the long journey, I will be a primary point of contact along with Raghav who will be our account manager. He'll take care of the commercial side of things. And I will be mostly your product person if I may. Okay?

Vitaly:
  Cool.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  And you were mentioning right? That you need this week time to get all the details. Can you tell me about? Is it the outlook credentials that you spoke with Yukta last time?

Vitaly:
  No, it's not, it's Google.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. It's.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  the Google credentials, they're accounting, email id credentials, right?

Vitaly:
  Yes, yes.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  And along with that, would you be able to get another detail? So right now, I understand there are 13 users, right? Can we also have clarity on who will be these users? How many will be in the accounting team and how many will be in the dispatch team before our next call? So that we can, so let me take a step back here, right? So this is how your onboarding journey will look like. Which will be our first call that you'll have with me would be a discovery call where I'll try to understand the kind of emails that the inbox is currently receiving, be it accounting or dispatch? If you would like to just focus on accounting first and phase it in a way where you like to bring the accounting team, make them go live. And after that, we'll start working on dispatch. In that case, we'll focus only on accounting team. And you'll have to take me through the type of emails that you receive, what features you know, would work best in terms of simplifying the day to day activity for daughter's group itself. So that will be the first call. And based on the information that we discussed, the second call will be a configuration call where with screen sharing, we will be configuring all the settings that we'll have to do to make sure the account is ready. And the third would be a user training. Where now let's say we're focusing on the accounting team. We bring them onto the call, the accounting team, the five to six users that we have. And then we take them through how their outlook interface will look moving forward, how they will have to log in using their daughter's group, email id, personal email id, moving forward, how the inbox will look like, what, how assignment works, and all these features that we will be setting up on the second call. The third call will do the user training for them. And the fourth call would be an admin workshop where I believe there's Irina from our daughter's group. And if there are any other admins who will look at the reporting part of things, the analytics side of things. We will take them through a workshop showing how they can pull up these reports based on how we set up the account, we'll show them. So this is where you see the response time. This is where you see who's working on these emails. So that will be more of a very consultative workshop that we'll have on them.

Vitaly:
  Yeah. I think, this is actually the way that I was looking forward to. So, yeah, because we want to see in work how this is going to work out with the accounting team because it's a smaller team. Okay? Dispatch is a bigger team. So we have to, you know, to see how things works out. And then once we have the accounting team, you know, ready to go and they, you know, everything is set up. So then we can move to the bigger team.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Now, with the four calls that I mentioned, four is the minimum number of calls that I'll request with you, but we can absolutely, I'm flexible and we can get on ad hoc calls. And while we are setting up if there are new features that you will, we found out that we want to configure we can absolutely do that. But I like to understand the timeline here. You did mention that we'd like to get started as soon as possible. So in this case, when would you think would be ideal for us to have the first call? Where we just talk about how we need to set this up? There would not be any configuration as such. This will only be discussion about how taurus group accounting team currently functions. So.

Vitaly:
  I would say, I would say… maybe the beginning of the next week. Okay? But that, that's, if only I finish, you know, all, the email set up because not everyone from the company even from the accounting team has a personal email. Okay? I think I'm also, you know, setting up for everyone and I'm I just have a list and I go one by one actually just with each employee because there are some other stuff that has to be done. So I have to, you know, go with each employee and set up email and do other stuff. I hope because I had this, you know, time, when was Christmas and the new year? And, you know, they had holidays and I wasn't able to finish everything. I.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  Absolutely. Understand. And actually, Whitley, for the email set up, you can take time because we will do that on our second call. The first call is just going to be how we are discussing right now, right? You can bring in the admins, the people who will be working on the day to day workflows as such from the taurus group as well to this call. And it would merely be where I will ask questions to understand how the team currently functions just from a time the email lands into their inbox till the time it is closed. So that will be the only agenda for the first call. So we can definitely do it on Monday. But if you think since it's going to be only a conversation if you'd like to have it sometime this week, we can do it, you can maybe check with the team internally with the taurus group team as well and see their availability and we can schedule that call. What do you think?

Vitaly:
  I think, yeah, I think it would be a good idea to bring. I'm… not sure for the first call if because they are kind of busy. So because the first call is going to be mainly a discussion, right?

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  That's right. Yes, it's going to be only understanding about how taurus group team currently functions that's going to be.

Vitaly:
  The first call and I can answer all those questions, but I think for the second call, probably it would be a good idea to bring. So what's going to be the second call? The second call is going to be like set up the account.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  That's correct, where we will sign up hiver. We will install hiver into their outlook. We'll create the shared mailboxes, add the users to it, and then start setting up all of these assignment rules, SLA, and all of these features. It will be a hands on live call where we'll be setting up features that will be the second call. And.

Vitaly:
  in the second call, do we have to add all the users like they have to be online or we can just add one or two. And then I can just add myself other users?

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, we can focus on adding yourself and the admins, again, who will be taking care of setting up the workflow with hiver moving forward, just them and complete all the settings. And right before the user training or right on our user training call, we can bring the team in.

Vitaly:
  Okay. So that means that we don't need them even for the second call that's.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  correct. We don't need it.

Vitaly:
  I think what we can do is just if you can leave me or send me an email after this call, and then once I'm done, I'm just going to send you an email and say, hey, I'm done. Let's set up the meeting and that's it. Yeah, that should work.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. In that case, what I'll do is I will send you an email, sharing this agenda, this onboarding plan with you.

Vitaly:
  Yes, yes, please.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  And then at the end of that email, I'll also share my scheduler link with you so that you can take this back with the tourist team and then schedule a call where based on first or the second call that they like to be part of, you can schedule that.

Vitaly:
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  Schedule the first two calls which will be the first discussion call and the second configuration call right now after this discussion with the tourist group, and we'll plan the user training and the admin training right after that.

Vitaly:
  Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Yes, perfect. All.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  Right. In that case, that's it for now Vitaly on our next call, I'm going to come up with a lot of questions. It might be repetitive, but all of that would make sense when we set it up on our second call. Yeah, that sounds good. What I'd request from your end is to just try to identify from at least from the holidays, the last 10 days, right? What kind of email communications came in? What different kind of categories do they belong to? And how are all these emails assigned to the agents currently? So all of these very basic day to day activities, if you're able to look into the details that will be very helpful for our next call you.

Vitaly:
  Know what? Well, maybe also, it's a good idea if you can, if you have some standard questions that you can kind of send me ahead of time. The email I can kind of, you know, try to find answers to those questions or even to talk with the team or, you know, because I think I know all the answers but I don't know all the questions. So maybe, you know, there are some questions that I won't be able to answer right away. So if you can send me some questions ahead of time, so that probably is going to speed up the process as well, you know, during the meeting, I'm.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  so, glad you brought that up, Vitaly. We do actually have an onboarding plan. It's a link where it almost looks like a questionnaire and you just have to fill in the details. This will also have the information about how we'll have four different calls. Let me go ahead, create that template for you and I'll share it with you. You can go ahead and fill in the details, and this will actually set up, set us up for a very good discussion on the very first call itself. So, let me know in the next 24 hours, you can expect that link from me.

Vitaly:
  Yeah. All right. Sounds good.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  I appreciate your time. Thank you if you have anything to add, no.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think, you summed it up really well. So let's stick to the plan and hopefully all go well. And of course, as you will be there now to take care of the team, you can still feel free with you or anyone from the team to reach out to me as well. If you have any questions, always happy to sort of, you know, pitch in whenever required.

Vitaly:
  Okay, perfect. All right.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@hiverhq.com):
  Thank.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You so much for your time, both of you have.

Vitaly:
  A great time. Yeah, thank you too. Yeah. Bye, bye bye.
