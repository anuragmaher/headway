Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  hey, Courtney.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Hey, Alex. How's it going?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's going pretty well. How about yourself?

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yeah, not too bad. Nice.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's been a busy week. I feel like it's like the first full week of the year.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yeah. It's been a busy month so far… kind of crazy.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Truly is.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yep.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Remind me where you're at again? Are you getting any of this crazy weather?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm based in New York City.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Oh, okay. Gotcha.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  We're getting some crazy weather but it's not that atypical?

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yeah, just normal winter things.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I was reading that New York has the largest fleet of plows in the nation.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Wow.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Random facts. Okay. And where are you based out of?

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  I'm in Phoenix, so, it's warm and sunny here. It's been in the seventies.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  That's lovely for.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Now.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Give me just one second. Let me ping the team. It looks like.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  we'll be in shortly one second. Okay?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Courtney, I actually spent a little bit of time in Gilbert, Arizona. Oh,

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. It was after it was during covid and we were looking to defrost a little. We'd spent some time up in the mountains.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Nice. What did you think?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I really liked it.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yeah. What time of year did you come? It was April? Okay. So it was still good weather.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  It starts to heat up shortly after that?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we were looking at the weather and we're like my goodness, it gets pretty hot down there.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Sure. Does.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Hey, Katie.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Hi, everybody. Sorry for being late. I was having trouble with the link, but got here. Awesome. And Chelsea is on her way as well. She's just also running a little late… perfect.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Well, we'll jump right into it when Chelsea arrives.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Courtney, have you ever heard of the southwest wildlife center?

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Can't say that? I have no.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I dropped it in chat, but it's a, they essentially, they rescue exotic or rescue animals from the Arizona region and a lot of them are like fairly exotic.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Yeah.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yeah, yeah, okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's a fun way to spend some time.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yeah. Did you visit?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I did.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  See any cool critters?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, they had all sorts of interesting critters… to me. They have all these like native foxes.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Oh, yeah, which?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Were pretty cool.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  I would imagine they get like coyotes and like snakes and stuff.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, tons of coyotes and I didn't realize that they like kind of burrow underground as much as they do.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yeah. We get them in the city every once in a while. I always get like notifications on my neighborhood app. It's like coyote sighting or like a haplina sighting. And sometimes it really is like the wild west out here.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It really is.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And I don't think anyone has downloaded the app yet. Is that right? Fair to say?

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  I have not. Okay.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Could you resend the invite for?

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  That we?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Can actually just get that up on the call. So one of, I mean, we can even get started in the next now while we wait for Chelsea to come in, but all we need is one of you to share screen that's Chelsea. Anyway… we'll just need her to jump on and one of you share your screen, and then we can walk you through the process. Takes five minutes.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Sounds good. I can share my screen. Perfect. Thanks, Katie. Yeah. And you guys said you can walk us through the process?

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Sure.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's awesome.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  And you said you dropped it in the chat for the link to it?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we just need a new tab. We'll get started.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Beautiful. All right. Well, I went ahead and clicked that. Sorry, I got to go back to the zoom meeting… and… More where's the share screen. Oh, there we go. Found it.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  All right. Can you guys see this? All right?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, what we're going to have you do based on our conversation last time, I think we've got the app approved. So I don't think we should have any trouble signing in. So, what we'll have you do is just click on, sign in on the top, right? Or even next to that. If you want to click on, start free trial, that's fine as well. Perfect. You just want to put your email address in?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just put email, yep, continue… perfect.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Oh, sorry. Let's see that's okay?

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yeah, what?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Should I do?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I can recall, enter justification so that's just a message that's going to go to your admin. Okay. Yeah. So maybe just hiver, shared inbox, tool, whatever demo, trial environment, whatever. So just essentially.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Okay. Request approval, and then Courtney, this goes to Michelle, right?

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yeah, it'll go to Michelle. Okay. Hopefully.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  She, she's asking me, is it a URL or an install?

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  It's an app. I think it's.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  a web application. So it's a URL, it's not like an install on your desktop or anything like that. It's a URL that you have to log into with your Microsoft credentials, standard single sign on. Okay?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  So, do we just ask for approval?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yep. Yeah, Michelle, we requested approval. She just has to go in and click approve, and that's it.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Requested approval.

Courtney Logan (clogan@chronicleheritage.com):
  Number eight number eight.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  OK. She's chatting or she's typing.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  She just said she found it. So, I guess she's approving it now.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sounds good.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. I would just say sign in with Microsoft… whenever we're ready?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Love how it makes me do that every time I thought there was a way to stop that, but maybe not.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  There's a box that says, don't ask again for 60 days? Oh, my gosh. Thank.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  You. I'm just so always focused on getting in… okay… next.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  OK. She said we should have access now.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Sorry, I don't know why it's making me do this right now.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It's okay. I think there's just like a two factor authentication push from the back end, but that's fine. So, I think this is gonna still make you, it's waiting for you to scan the code. Yep. I'm doing that now. Okay. No worries. Yes, I approve. Sign in.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  There we go. I think… perfect. I think we're in awesome. Awesome. Yeah. So, I think we're in all we need. Yeah, you can just fill that in there. It's gonna come to Alex and I, so you can just throw in a generic number even if that's fine, whichever works.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Okay. Wait, so, is this gonna text me or is it?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No, nothing at all. It's just for registration.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Okay. I will put in my work number.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, yeah. So this is where you connect the shared inbox. So I assume that that's a HR ad email address?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  So, if we have this is a DL… a distribution list, not so much an inbox. Is this still gonna work?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that should be fine. So that's the third option that you see there is a distribution list beautiful.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  And let's see. Maybe it doesn't like me. For some reason. Let's try Leo west. Yeah… there we go.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So you are a member of the group, right? Yes.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  I am… it's making us do this again?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  All right, Chelsea, could you text Michelle again or message her?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  I can do it too, if you're preoccupied.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You can go back to app for now. Let's see whether we've got, we can help you explore a couple of other things.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Okay. I'm gonna message Michelle right now though, just to give me… a second paper request. All right?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Should I, your inbox is not created, start over with a different inbox or just go to hiver? Com?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hey, Jeevan, I think you're on mute. Sorry. Yeah, I was talking to myself, Katie. So I just think you can just go in and click on start over with a different email. Yeah. And then, we can try HR at palio west again, if we're good.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Okay. I don't know if this got approved.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Can you go back, one second… click on, you can click on the third option. Yeah.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Yeah. So this needs the approval that I just pinged Michelle zambeck for sure. I could put it in again, but I think that would just be spamming.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's fine. I think one, I think the request should have been sent out already.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Okay. Sounds good. Is it getting sent to it's?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Getting sent to Michelle? Zambeck? I just sent her a text asking her to give us access.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Yeah, she approved our first request for the second one. I guess it's to set up the hrdl?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  And it's been approved. Okay. So… now we should.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That should work now. Yep. Yeah.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  So, do I hit start over or?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Should I, yeah, you can just start over? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. HR distribution and then third option and then continue authorize.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Yes, it's me.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  There we go. Perfect. You can invite other team members just by just putting their emails in here.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Courtney, that's right for you, right? I feel like you're pretty easy. That should be it. Yeah, that's good. Beautiful. And then I'm definitely going to look up Chelsea's because I am terrible with names anyway. All right. Copy that.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Should I invite Sam and I'm guessing, so, should I invite everybody who's on?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  There, you can also do this and modify this list at any time from your panel, which I'm going to walk you through?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Yeah. Let's go ahead and finish this step then.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, you might have to, does Chelsea have a paleo vest here?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Yes, she does. Sorry about that. I just grabbed the first one that was on there.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, are they both separate email domains with two different accounts or are they aliases of one or the other?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  They are, the emails go to both of them. Unfortunately, we have to, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. Okay. So you can just keep this set up for now. Okay? And then we can walk through the rest. Perfect. So, Courtney… Chelsea, all you have to do is you'll… get a link in your inbox, you can click on it or you can just go to app, hiverhq.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Com and then log in with your Microsoft account, and you'll just be part of the account that Katie just created and you will find the HR inbox which I'm going to talk to you, talk you through in a second. Since we're here and we're called, we can, you can get rid of the tour guide, Katie for now?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  I can skip this, you said, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You can skip it. You can skip it for now. Yeah, that's fine. So essentially where how this works is anytime an email, and just to make sure everything is working correctly, Alex, can you just send a test email to HR at paleovest? Com? Yep. Perfect. So the first thing that you'll notice is that you on the left there you can, you will see the HR mailbox in here. So this will now be a shared environment for everyone who's going to be a participant in hiver in this mailbox to work out of, right? So first things first, where do new emails come in? All the new emails come into a section called unassigned right there under the second folder there. So this is where all the brand new emails come in. From here. You are able to read the email. You are able to check it. And then you will find this side panel to handle all your day to day ticketing activities. The ticketing setup is supposed to essentially answer three primary questions which is the first question is who is handling this email ticket? So that's exactly there. So you assign it to that person, that email immediately leaves the unassigned section.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Okay. So now it's under mine, got it because.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You assign it to yourself, it will be under mine and that activity that you just did is logged and timestamped. So when you open any email, you'll know exactly who's done what. So, right? Just below that side panel, a little bit below, on the screen, Katie, you will see that Katie self assigned this conversation at 954 am. There is an activity panel on the right. On the right. Okay. Oh, yep. There it is, right? So an email comes in. What we want to do is automatically assign it to someone. You assign this first one to yourself. While we were doing that, there has been a new email that's come into an assigned. You can go and grab that. That should be Alex's email. Perfect. Let's say, let's assign this to someone else? You assign it to. The second you assign it to code that goes out of here as well. And now all of the email that you've assigned across the team is visible in this team section. Right now, the team section is broken into sub folders for each individual person. So, for example, if Courtney's on pto at a particular time, you just have to click on the folder there, see all of Courtney's emails, or see all the back and forth in each individual thread. So you don't have to wait for context or like figure out what's happening on that thread. You have all the context in front of you are right up until the final email and you can step in and take over very easy. Okay. Right? So all the replies here is visible to everybody else. You don't have to CC. So it's sort of your same page. Yeah. Go ahead, I.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Have a quick question. Okay? When it says which plan works best for you, are we doing the… are we just playing start free trial? Because it's giving me annual or monthly or just press start free trial? Does it not matter?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Are you logging in with your paleo west email, paleo west email? I.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Got the email and it said complete setup… that Katie has hired? I met, Katie had added me, and then I said complete setup and that's why I selected. Okay?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Would it be possible to share your screen for just a second? We'll take a look.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Can y'all, see that? So I went to complete setup.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So that is the fixer email.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Oh, sorry. Wrong one. Oh my God.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No, that's completely fine. No worries. You should have an hiver email in your inbox as well. If not, we'll guide you on how you can get there right now. Even if you don't have the invite email, that's fine.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Okay. We're good. Sorry, I obviously clicked on the wrong one.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's fine. Okay. If we're all set, Katie, maybe we can go back to your screen… so that we can continue just going through some basic areas. So now, if everything looks good and Chelsea, you're on Katie, if you can just go to try and reassign, you should see perfect.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. So now the best part about this team section is when you go into the team section, you can get an overview of what everyone's working on under the first folder over there called all assignees… right? So now, if you notice all the emails are individually going to be there on the left, the main thing that you're going to see is that the name of the person assigned to it is mentioned right underneath it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So let's say an email comes in, you assign it to someone, they… start working on it. And at some point you want to step in, take over, all of that happens within the team section right here. When a request is completed, that can be tracked by across the team. Again by the second folder, the field over there on the right panel, which is the status. So when an email comes in by default, it comes in as open. From there, it can go to pending or closed based on the progress. Now as the second you change an email from open to pending or closed, it literally tells hiver that this is no longer an active request. So it will go away from the active team section. So previously there were two emails in the team section. Now there's just one where do these go? They don't disappear forever. So if you click on all views… you will see pending and closed as separate folders over there on the left, now an email comes in from… an employee, you reply asking for more information. And until the person replies to that with more information, there is nothing for you to do. So in those scenarios, those emails can go to pending. Now, the reason why that can go to pending is if that person does send in more information, hiver will automatically detect that a new response has come in and will automatically push it back to open and will push it back to the team section or the mind section depending on who it's assigned to.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I hope that makes sense.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And the same thing applies for closed if you mark something as resolved. But two days later that person says, hey, I actually have a new question. In those scenarios, hiver will push it into the closed folder. And if a new reply comes in, it will bring it back to open.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  So if a new reply comes in, so let's say that I have… man. Okay, let's say that we have all views, grab the one. So all views, there's nothing here.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You can click on team.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Oh, there we go. Got it. So the, so they're both open. And then if I close it, and then Alex krumm emails me again for this, it'll pop it right back up to open.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's correct. Okay.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Gotcha.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. So those are the two main aspects of hiver. So who's handling it and what progress has been made. The third aspect is sort of for your organization or categorization, of this HR inbox. So that's where tags come in. So on the right there, you can create tags under the status tags are essentially a team level categorization system. So if you create a tag, it doesn't belong to any one individual person, it belongs to the HR mailbox. So people who joined maybe six years one year later can access and use the same set of tags. And when one person applies a tag on an email, everyone else sees it. Okay. So the idea is whenever you look at an email, you know exactly who's handling it, what type of an email it is, and… what… progress has been made. And to tie all of this together, you can create as many tags and Chelsea, Courtney, even in your screen, you can actually see these tags pop up here as well. So you can use it on an email. And when you use it, everyone else will be able to see it. And if you notice on the left in the team section, in the overall view, the name of the tags are visible there as well. So you could just get, if you have training emails in your HR mailbox at a single glance, you know, what each email is about, who's handling it without even having to open a single email. I.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  have a quick question, Chelsea, we have a meeting at 10. Did we push that back? I saw that somebody hopped into it?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Sorry, this isn't a hiver question. I just wanted to that's.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  fine. If we've got a hot stop, we can grab some more time, okay?

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  I tried to jump on and I don't think they're there, but it looks like they may have had, they didn't respond either, but give me one second. I'll jump on and see if they're there.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Okay. Yeah. Just message me.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  I have a question. Sure. So with the analytics, can everybody who's part of this team, see the analytics? So see the ticket count?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Great question depends on the role that they've got. So let me walk you through that, right? So if you can click on the little gear icon on the far left of your screen, the admin button?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  The admin tab right here, so.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. Yeah. Right below that, on those list of icons, the last icon, yeah, the last one. Yeah, perfect. So this is where you come to set up stuff on the admin side, you can set up your email inboxes. If you need more, you can create more here. There's AI that we can figure out there's. If there are other apps that you want to check out like a project management app, we can definitely help you figure that out as well. For the sake of our call. Can you click on users? Okay? For the sake of the question? Sorry. So essentially, if you notice there are multiple people here, and once you click on, yeah, you can assign them multiple roles. So members don't see reports, don't see the admin panel, but admins and mailbox inbox admins, they do. Okay. That makes sense.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Looks like Chelsea still hopped off. Yeah, the reason why I ask is because my fiance, his work also has a ticket counter like this, but it was causing drama between the teams of who had the most ticket counts and like tension and stuff. And I was like there should they should like be able to, I don't think everybody should see that. I think it should just be the managers that was my suggestion.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. I think, yeah, I mean, I can only imagine so you can define, you can decide who gets access to what, and you can have as many people in as many roles. It shouldn't be a problem. So you've got that in there just in the interest of time because I actually do have a hard stuff in about 10 minutes. Yeah, just in the interest of time, like I said, we can grab some more time as well to explore some of these other items. Could you just click on shared inboxes, Perfect. Can you click on the HR inbox? Perfect? So on that once you go into the HR inbox, Katie, there's a bunch of stuff here that might be, very, helpful, right? So specifically, I want to focus on automations. So the, that's auto assignment that's like a round Robin, oh, automations, automation. So this is your way of setting up workflows or rules or things essentially ways in which you can eliminate repeated manual effort by setting up a rule that takes care of it every single time. So, for example, if an email comes in and all onboarding requests are handled by Kourtney, you can set up an automation that says all automation requests can automatically be assigned to sorry onboarding. Requests can automatically be assigned to Kourtney. Okay. So it's a very simple workflow builder. The flow is fairly straightforward. It's a, when event occurs. Now, the event could be an email coming in, an email being sent out. Typically, it's email coming in. When an event, when an email comes in, we want to check that email for a particular condition. So the condition could be the person sending the email. So if you want to say, hey, all emails from a particular source, but for our event use case over here, I would say that the main two things that we can base things on is subject and body. So based on keywords that are there in the subject or the body of the email. So, for example, if the body contains the word offboarding, for instance, every time that comes up, you can automatically ask hiver to do a bunch of actions, right? So you can click on add step action… and the action could be assigning it to someone could be adding a tag, could be sending a reply. So if there is a standard set of steps that is required to do for an offboarding email, you can get a head start on those steps by setting up rules to take care of it.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  That's awesome. I love this that way we don't have to assign the tags. It'll just add it automatically that's really cool.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And then that flows into the analytics as well because at hiver, at some point, what you'll see is these tags and stuff building up. So three weeks in four weeks in, you go into the analytics dashboard. You can actually start pulling reports on how many offboarding requests you handled, how long did they take to get completed? Where were the delays? What are the improvements? All of that sort of pops up? And given that it's automated, then you get like a very clear picture.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Okay. This is awesome. All right. Was there anything else? I know you said you only had about probably less than 10 more minutes, but yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just, yeah, so we can check that out. I do want to talk about the AI piece as well. So if you've got like for example sops for offboarding and onboarding, and you want hiver to sort of refer those sops and give you very personalized responses, the hiver AI, what it does is it helps you… train it with information relevant for your team. So if you see the knowledge sources tab there, you can actually go in and upload documents. If you maintain stuff in notion. If you've got documents that you can upload, essentially, what it does is it learns from the information that you provided. So if one of your team members asks a question about benefits or payroll or offboarding… and onboarding and new requests, essentially, it'll read the email, it'll go find relevant information about that email from the knowledge sources that you upload and it can answer questions without you going to look for the information yourself. Or it can even compose a specific personalized email that you can edit and send out.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Oh, okay. So it can compose an email. And then you said if my team has questions like what's the process for offboarding? Let's say they could go and ask AI what's the next step I should do?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So if you go back to your home screen, I'll show you what that looks like. So if you can open any email in the team section… so on the bottom right of your screen, you should see a little blue color like AI button. So you can either ask hiver questions and look up information and it'll give you information. And then… it can also draft a reply. And all of this is running on chatgpd five point two, which is the model that is running on. But yeah, you will have to give it information to pull it from there. No.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  That's fair. I just threw something in there.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's fine. So that's exactly how it works.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  And if I say dislike, is that going to be like you're incorrect? Let me tell you the proper information. Like what are the?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And it'll learn from it. Okay? Excellent. And so that's great. And also on the left. So this is of course, for AI generated responses, there are a couple of other ways in which we help you reply quickly. One is let's say like you just did you want to just put like a rough draft in there? So if you just hit reply on this email… let's say you're in a hurry, you've just typed out a rough draft for an email. What hiver's AI allows you to do is it also takes the information. So the rough draft will have information that's relevant, right? So it'll take that information, exactly, click on AI, compose and it can rewrite rough drafts so that you don't have to do spell checks and grammar and write full sentences. You just throw in the relevant information and it'll improve it for you and you can of course, customize this as you go by the prompt at the bottom. So you don't have to like go in and rewrite emails. You just put it in there with errors and everything and it will clean it up. And if you just sort of go back, no… the same place. Yeah. So next to the AI button, to the left, there is an email template. So that's sort of a standard reply that you can save within hiver. So if you have standard questions, you can just click on shared with all right there. And then you might need to go to the template section. So on the far left, you will see above the admin panel, the fourth icon, one below perfect third icon. Yeah. So you can click on create template and it literally helps you create a template. So this is a standard response that will help… you and you can, and this is a shared resource. So one person creates a template, everyone else can use it.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Yeah, no, this is great. This is really good analytics. We're not too worried about. We're just more worried about the functionality and getting it off the ground. But yeah, I'll go ahead and build this out this week and I saw that we have a.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Save everything we've already done and just.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  absolutely. Yeah, this account just rolls over. And of course, Alex and I will be here to help you get started. And then you can also, so apart from us, you also have access to a 24 seven tech support team. So on the bottom left of your screen, you will see a little support button right above that. So that's a help center. So that's got information. You've got instant support. So you'll be in front of a human being within 60 seconds. And, yeah… awesome.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Yeah, no, this looks great. I really appreciate your time and taking taken to share with us. I don't know if we'll want another training. It'll depend once we check with Chelsea and see if she wants to schedule more time, but I'm feeling pretty confident about being able to build it out from this.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. There's also guides that are available in the product. So the help center has a lot of step by step, how to guides as well, which are really helpful.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  But yeah, so let us know if you have any questions, and we'll be happy to help. I do have to jump, but maybe Alex, we can grab some time for a check in towards the end of the trial and see how things are going.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Yeah, that would be perfect. Great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Thanks everyone. I'll chat soon. Alex will coordinate. Thank you. All right.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Thank you, everyone. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Do we want to just do a quick check in?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Oh, 14 days from now. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  14, I was thinking maybe seven days and then.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Oh, yeah. Just see.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Where we might need some more assistance or, you know, questions will come up.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Okay. So today's the 20 eighth, do we want to meet on Thursday? The fifth? That would be about a week? Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  The same time works on our end. Okay?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Let me check our schedule real quick. I should be able to very quickly make sure everybody has that. Let me see. Oh, my… gosh. Sorry, of course, my computer is being funky right now. All right. Scheduling assistant. So we said the fifth and then same time for me. Oh, looks like same time isn't going to work. Cool. Let me see. Are you available like an hour earlier?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Maybe. I am. Yeah, I don't want to go too early though because I know you're… is that like seven 30? Well?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  For us, actually, it looks like everybody should be available at that time on everyone's schedule. Looks like it'll be nine for me, 10 for me, Chelsea, and like 11 for Sam. So hopefully he'll be able to make it and me and Courtney are on the same schedule. So, okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, sorry, what time did you want to meet on the fifth?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  Sorry, it'll be nine a M Mountain Time. Perfect. Okay. We could make it nine 32. It looks like we have availability.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Nine a M mountain works well. All right. Perfect. Hold for hybrid check in.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Great. Okay. Well, let.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  us know how we can support you in the meantime and good luck with the trial, yeah.

KatherineLara-Steely:
  No, thank you so much for your time. We'll be in touch in a couple of weeks.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Okay. Perfect. Talk to you then. Bye.
