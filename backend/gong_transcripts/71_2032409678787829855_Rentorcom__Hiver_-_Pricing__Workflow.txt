Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  I think we actually just only need, we only need 1,818.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me just pull up the current user list so that you can help me understand.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  I haven't looked at the users that I have in a while, but… how.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  about we check that quickly right now? We can do it together and then you can let me know the correct user account.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  And then I'll also pull in my account manager so that he can help us with the commercial side of things.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So I just sent in the chat there. I sent a list right there. I think that's 18 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 15, 16, 17, 18. Yeah, it's 18.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Me go. I'm loading up into the admin panel. I'm loading into hiver admin users and roles, let me see who we have in there, Andrew, Brian, Jake, Jen, Jenny… that's interesting. It looks, yeah. So the users in hiver is 18. So I guess I'm missing what the?

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  Yes. And with our new pricing model, I'm sorry?

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Here come here.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  Raghav.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  So, Darus?

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  And I have, we're going through the renewal which is on February third. They're currently on the pro plan and he has 18 active users. I was just getting started on the entire based pricing that we currently have. Okay?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thanks for breaking that down real quick. Pavitra, hey, Darus, how's it going? My apologies. My previous meeting ran over and I couldn't hop on quickly.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  You're good?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You're good? All right. Perfect. So, Darus, we've got a couple of changes on the hiver side that we wanted to put forth in front of you and discuss ahead of the renewal. Now, the first change is that hiver no longer operates on an individual user license as purchasing. Okay, which means from this renewal forward, we will be moving you to our tiered pricing just like we're doing with our entire customer base as a whole. This means that going forward one.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  More time you're switching from per user to you're.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  moving to a tiered or bucketed pricing model, which means going forward, you will be purchasing seats in buckets of five, six to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20 and so on and so forth.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Okay. So we have 18.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, whatever.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  18. Yeah, it sounds like we'd just be overpaying.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Yes. Yeah. So you'll be effectively paying in addition for two users. When you're looking at the billing perspective of it. On the other side, this also means that you have two additional licenses to use whenever you need that, you know, those extra licenses, new members, additional team members for ops, anything on that front.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Yeah, yeah. We don't have any hiring plans at the moment, but sounds good all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. So, that's the first change in itself. The second change that we've done is looking at the way everybody's received AI. We've also now incorporated AI into our standard pricing tiers instead of having it as a separate price or separate piece to add on. And what this gives you is obviously more room to explore and look at ways to optimize your functionality on hiver with AI and gives you unlimited access to AI. So we're not going to do metered AI usage. It's going to be AI features on this tier as many times as you want to use. You get to use it.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, I think the idea of doing like a working session would be great because I don't think we're really?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I don't think you're using.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  I had a presentation, you know, for some of it and, you know, I think we're not really using. We're not getting the value. You know, we're not competent to maximize it. And then, you know, I think there's some fun things, you know, like the sentiment that's kind of cool. But yeah, it's not. I don't think we're maximizing it. We haven't really seen anything that we're using currently that we would miss, you know, if it wasn't there, we're not like, hey, where did that go? You know, if it all disappeared, it doesn't actually currently impact our day to day performance if.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  I may add here Darus, I was going through the setup on the backend and I noticed that on your support inbox, you currently have the automation setup about 10 to 15 automations, where it's all on assignments based on the keywords it's currently getting assigned to the users. So that is one thing that you're extensively using when it comes to, hey, what is hiver doing inside our inbox at this point? So it is taking care of the assignments. So what I would like to focus is on all other aspects. We can get in details when it comes to automations, not just focus on subject clients or just the sender but get into the cracks of it and try to understand, you know, where are we manually putting all the effort now? How do we automate that? Now with AI in picture in our pro plan, you will be able to incorporate AI and automations together, make them talk and do much more better things. And that's that was the first reach out that I reached out to you as well because I want, I saw potential where we could improvise from where we are already at. Okay?

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Yeah. And then obviously, you know, there's this isn't the point of the conversation but there's going to be some overlap with, you know, gemini which is integrated. So some overlap in regards to AI generated response. And, you know, the AI compose versus the built in gemini, but I think it's just something we're not familiar with the feature. So, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And to your point on that there is we've been conscious because we live in Gmail ecosystem. Gemini is always going to come up. So we've made the right measures and put in the right guardrails and checks in place to make sure our model that we give you as hyper AI is more contextual, more aware and more tuned to what you're using ever for. Yeah.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  You know, I think that, the main thing is that you guys have a great tool that we very much appreciate and like they're the reality though is that there comes a breaking point for the billing which you guys are well aware of, right? Where like you cross a certain line and we're like, gosh, we're gonna pay like we're paying 600 dollars a month for an email tool and then it's gonna bump up to X amount exactly, you know, this is a conversation. It's it's no different than any business.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  But regarding.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Whatever the pricing structure you've got figured out, hey, you have a business run, you have to keep the lights on, you know, but that's just the balancing point is that at some point we're gonna say, gosh, you know, if it's a certain over a certain amount, I have 18 employees, right? So you start crossing over and like it's like 40 bucks a user, it's not terrible. Okay. We're hitting then it starts getting up and it's like, you know, 80 bucks. We're like, gosh, you know, yeah, yeah, keep rocking you're doing good, appreciate.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That, and I do want to tell you that we are cognizant in terms of having this discussion. You're probably the thirteenth customer that I've handled or had this conversation just in the last two weeks. So, one thing I do want to tell you is given your relationship with hiver and partnership over the years, we're not gonna come today and tell you, hey, it's gonna two X and you're gonna be having to pay this price, right? Yeah. So let's price your current tiers at 65 usd right now with a sweet battle discount. You're paying us about 30 bucks per person, give or take. We would be looking at a meaningful increase that's not too excessive and doesn't make you rethink. Hey, do I need hyper, right? So that's effectively the perspective that we're coming in from a couple of things. I do want to check with you before I roll out any formal offer letters or renewal orders and sorry renewal order forms. Would you be open to a multi year contract just to lock in and secure less prices, long term wise?

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Yeah. I think, you know, obviously, we've been with you guys for two years. We switched from Zendesk to hiver and hiver is one of the tools that, you know, it's working because we don't talk about it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, like.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  It's not part of our team meeting. We don't even talk about hyper. It's just, it works, we assign stuff back and forth. It's exactly what we want. So, yeah. So, so, yeah, I think at this point, I outside of the price getting so high that I'm like, all right, maybe I hire a developer and, you know, probably spend way more to try to build it myself. But that's where it's like, you know, if I had a developer and I paid him like 10,000, 20,000 dollars or something. And then we realized, well, gosh if we're gonna pay this amount, there's an Roi after 18 months, you know, I'm not saying we're doing that. I'm just saying that's theoretically, you know, you cross a certain line, you're like, well, yeah, I mean, the reality of reality is what you guys have built is incredibly complicated. We can't vibe code some replacement there's. There's so much complexity in the back end and it's just not right. So, anyway, yeah, to answer your question, yes, we'd be open to multi year.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Well, that makes perfect sense. And to your point of, hey, you know what? At a certain price scale, given the type of business and the scale of your business as well, you do have to make a very conscious choice and decision of, hey, we started at X. Since then, we've now currently risen to X plus one. And if we knew we're looking at X plus two or X plus three in terms of pricing. So what's the bottom line benefit for you at the end of the day, right? So that Roi conversation, I've got two things that I want to present you with. Firstly now that you've showed willingness to be open to multi years, I'm going to go back to leadership, secure the best price possible given the three year relationship that we'll be renewing pretty soon, get that over to you before end of day max tops, worst case tomorrow, first thing in the morning, right? What we'd also be doing is to your point investing more with our partnership and that's where Pavitra, your new success manager will be taking the lead. Just like how you've supported and believed in the product. All these years. We'd love to maybe spend the next three months in a more controlled sequenced and structured manner where you tell us, hey, these are now the challenges that have risen up in the business in the last six months. This is the business goal for 20 26. What we'd like to achieve, we'd love to reverse engineer that and support you in that journey as well. Just from the perspective of it's, no longer going to take you six months, nine months of realizing an Roi. We'd love to work with you on a much shorter time frame with handholding and white glove service along the way. Yeah.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  That makes total sense. And yeah, like we talked about in the beginning, you know, probably good. We've never properly gone through to explore all the features, you know, because we just kind of used it very simplistically here's, our inbox here's, our stuff, you know, and that works for us because everything for us happens in our property management software at folio.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  The, what would?

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Be of interest and, you know, consideration is if there was a mechanism for integration and potentially using the developer apis so that, you know, when a owner which is our clients, these are rental property owners when they email. And then hiver catches that. It's you know, it matches this email. It automatically adds a note with the contents. You know what I'm saying in there that's just an example of like what would be really cool? Because right now we have Gmail, but then, you know, we're not adding them as a record into the system.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, makes total sense. And, you know, you're one among probably eight other, you know, high value customers in the real estate space that I've been with hiver. We've worked with great action property management, knl, reality, kubernetes, and law, pelican property management group, power property group, so on and so forth. So quite a lot of players in your market in the space that have leveraged in this. Hiver, appfolio is probably one of the top used property management systems out there as well. For the API. You do have to be on appfolio max yourself as well. We already.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Have an API process. So we're already building out our own API integrations with it. So, yeah, we're right there with you. That's good for you to know that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, we've done scoping calls sufficient number of times for a sales Guy to know, okay, you need appfolio max there reality of our side of things as well. So, yeah, all of this to basically say Darus, that one, we would definitely love to kick off and continue that optimization angle for faster and more meaningful Roi for you to track and possibly see the team in process. And on the pricing side, I'll follow up like I said, latest tomorrow first thing in the morning with a new contract option. And the pricing on what that looks like. You did mention there's no immediate room for growth or expansion. So I am going to keep the training user as the count for the renewal and have that pricing worked up against it.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah. If we're not going to, if we're not going to… have 18 and 20 and we might bring on a person or two. So it's okay. Makes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sense. Yeah. With both of that, said apis are also something that we're investing in here at hiver, direct integration with appfolio or otherwise. So I do see a future probably a quarter away where you would be able to do more meaningful automations either where you're a zapier that flows information back to appfolio or direct tie in with appfolio as an API connection exclusively more than.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Integration. Yeah. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  But what I do want to do is unpack a bit more on the appfolio piece because I'm guessing you might also have mapping for property managers versus the properties that they manage given, you know, the kind of support team that you run. Do you have like high value customers, high priority locations, things like that?

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  We don't exactly track like we should, but we don't really track. We don't differentiate. So if there's an owner that has a lot of properties versus someone that has one property, we don't have currently like a leaderboard for owners, it's just an owner in the system. So, yeah, I mean, I think that I'd be up to exploring it. I haven't thought about it very much because it honestly isn't really an issue. It's not a concern, you know. So if we have a client and they're an owner, you know, we just go and look, we look in their email, we copy and paste their email into Gmail, right? It's what you guys do too, right? It's just like you're just looking in Gmail, you might have Hubspot or something where it's notes, but you end up just going to Gmail anyway. So it's… not like I said, it's not like we need to have the integration, but I don't know, I mean it might be, it might be kind of cool if there was like, you see right here, all this stuff right here. This is what I built, right? This doesn't exist. The last note, add a note. It's the most insane design process. The bottom right down here. This is where you add notes, right? Can you imagine like the detachment from your user base? Like what happens is I have this owner and I want to add a note. So I have to like versus… just adding a note. So I'm adding this, you can see this is what it looks like when you turn it off. So you don't know what the last note was. You don't have any sort of action system. So, I could see a scenario where we'd say, you know, what it'd be kind of cool if hiver had an integration because what would be kind of cool is a button that said, you know, open hiver tickets, right? The ones that are currently open and you would just click that and that would bring you to show you the current open to, I don't know just something like that?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I hear what you're going for. And curious, I did notice that you've got like different levels of services as well that you offer as a business. Would there be interest? And I'm thinking a bit more long term, maybe a month down the line or something like that once we progress in the discussion where, you know, you'd like to maybe prioritize based on the service in itself.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  What on the service?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Like for instance, marketing and tenant screening versus an owner who probably gets the whole suite of services with you as a business in terms of your engagement with your clients. Oh.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Yeah, we only do full management where we do everything or we do leasing only where we just get the proper lease and then we hand it back. So we don't have like tiers, you know, we don't have the equivalent of, you know, pro and,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  yeah.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Yeah, we don't have it's not out of the picture in the future. We could explore some sort of, you know, pro and elite. It's just not applicable for us. It's just you're a property owner. We take care of everything for you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You know, but anyway,

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  for the sake of conversation, I think it's great. We love the tool, you know, I, you guys got to get your lights on, you know, you got to keep, your team incentivized. I completely understand there's a lot of capital expenditure for developing and maintaining a tool. So, yeah, if you want to send over the proposal, that'd be great. And, and then to the point earlier on the idea of kind of a working session, yeah, I'd be happy to kind of look at the numbers and then if… we, you know, decide to renew that'd, be great to get those scheduled. And I'd love your help to kind of maximize the tool a.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  100 percent. We're fully committed in making sure we do have you renew just because of the two three year relationship. So don't worry like I said, it's not going to be a surprise. It's not going to be a 50 or 100 percent increase from what you're paying today, especially because you're open to two years. I'll send you the offers. So look at it and fingers crossed. We get that over the dotted line and Pavitra and I will be more than happy to get involved in a more hands on level as opposed to what we've been doing so far.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  Yeah. Okay. That's great. All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. So that was it for me. Just wanted to have those validated and expectations set on the right note over to you Pavitra in case there's anything else you wanted to chat about before we wrap up?

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  That's great. You got something I'm.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  good, Darus, I think we are good to close for today. I think we'll take it over an email and once we have the renewal sorted, we'll schedule the workflow session call.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. That's great. Cool.

Darus Trutna (darus@rentor.com):
  All right. Well, you guys have a good rest of your day and we'll talk soon. Thank you. Bye bye.
