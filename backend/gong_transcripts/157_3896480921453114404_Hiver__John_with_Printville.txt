Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, John. Can you hear me?

John Long (john@printville.net):
  There we go. Now. I'm unmuted.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  There we go. Hi. How are you going?

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Doing well. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just dealing with a bit of the flu, but otherwise feeling healthy kicking well.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  I'm sorry?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. You're good to go. It seems like there's some random flu flying around here in India.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  My kids, two of my kids have it. My wife's got it. I've managed to stay away from it, so.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Where are you? Oh, I'm based in Chennai, a coastal city down south in India.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  In India. Okay. Gotcha. Cool. All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Brilliant. Well, hey, John, pleasure meeting. You just quickly put a face to the name.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hi, I'm Raghav. I'm going to be working with you on the AI conversation for today. And in the future if you need anything in terms of understanding better things about hiver and things like that, I'm going to be a go to person. I'm going to go on video so that I can reach for a box of tissues next to me. Yes.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  John, pleasure meeting you. I understand that today's, conversation was to learn more about the AI perspective of hiver. So I want to pass it back to you to kick us off and.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Well, actually, so I'm not sure how that got put in there. We're actually just here to talk about renewal.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, sweet. I'm sorry, I think I might have got my wires crossed. Go ahead, please. All right. Just give me one minute. I'm just trying.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  To, yeah, we're really just here to talk about renewal.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. There we go. I've got your details. Yeah. So it looks like you were on a discounted legacy plan on hiver and that you're saying that you need like 13 people this year for renewal?

John Long (john@printville.net):
  30, oh no, just the same amount of users that we currently have. We really just want to continue using hiver the way that we've been using it at the same rate. And just keep going. I think we were around 14 or 15 dollars per user, I think is what it was. I can't remember you'd have to look.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let me check that out real quick. All right. You?

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Guys did the same thing last year for us and that was good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. All right. So, from what I can see, it looks like you were around the 24 dollar per user per month mark and.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  then they did a discount.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  A refund. Yeah, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It looks like there was a bit of a refund and the total has been adjusted. So as it stands right now, your billing is at 206 dollars for 14 people, 14 point change. Yeah. Say that again, you're at 200 dollars for like 14 people. So that's about 14 dollars per person. So you're right there?

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Yep. That's right. I think it was around 14, something like that. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, if we.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Can continue that as is we'll stick on board with hiver… you know, we don't use every feature, but what we do use, it works for us, you know, if the price goes up, then unfortunately, we just, you know, we gotta look at some other things, but I'm pretty sure you guys can probably do that. I know you've always been able to do that in the past. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that makes total sense. So a couple of clarifying questions for you, John is just that, you know, since the, as you would have realized as well since last year to now as well, there's been a lot of functionality that we've launched as a result of which pricing has been corrected to keep up with market standards. And the way hiver works now, the one thing that I do want to clarify with you is that you're on a plan of hiver, which is the one tier below the highest tier on hiver. But when I'm checking out your usage, it doesn't necessarily seem like you're using quite a lot of hiver.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  We're not you're right? Really what we're the only thing that we're using, I believe in the growth plan is the rule based automation… chat. We can do without if, you know, if we don't get that, that's okay. So yeah, we're not using and we really don't need all those features, of course. So I don't know what that might mean to, you know?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure, for sure, no, it does mean quite a decent bit because, you know, when I'm going to go back to my leadership, have a quick discussion about the discounting angle. The way in which you're leveraging hiver as well. All of this comes into play. You know, when we decide on the set, certain price point that makes sense for a specific business like yours, right? The one thing that I do want to mention is that as of right now, you're on hiver's pro plan, not the growth. And the list price for that is 45 dollars per person per month.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Yeah, you definitely don't need that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly, right. And the reason you're on the pro plan, not the growth at 25 is because the growth has a cap of 10 people total, maximum, right? That's.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  right. I remember that last year. Yeah. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's pretty much the percentage or like the reason why you're on a tier. While I definitely see that you're not using all that the pro plan has to offer. It does look like it's purely reliant on just the number of people that you've got on hiver, that's correct? So, John, the first clarification I do want to tell you is that we might not be able to continue on the 14 dollar per user per month kind of perspective just from a pure pricing angle. I want to be fully transparent in that there will be a price increase involved in this year's renewal at the same time. It's not going to be a significant increase where you're going from like 14 to 28 or 14 to 32 or anything on that front, right? So, what we typically do is on a year on year renewal, we have anywhere between an eight to 12 percent price increase, right? What I can do is have a discussion with my team and see if we can effectively have a two dollar increase for your subscription, right? So that way, you know, it's going to be like a very minimal increase two dollar per user per month, which means your effective billing would be instead of 14. It's going to be around the 16 dollar mark for the 14 active people that you have right now for the whole year.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  So here's what we'll do. If, if you can get that, then we will stay with you this year. But if you do that, I will go ahead and process my cancellation for next year. That way I have flexibility.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. I mean, it's only going to be a year on year renewal. So you're free to cancel before the next year mark, right?

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Now, but recognize that if you do, that what you're doing is you're kind of locking in… us leaving next year, you know? And so if that's what you guys want to do then that, then I understand then two dollars, I would agree to that, you know, for one more year… and I'd be happy with that, but I would go ahead and process my cancellation. And so I would like for you to honor the price that you've been doing and see if you can take that to your leadership. But if not, I understand the two dollar increase. And so, you know, if you can get it to one dollar increase, then maybe that makes it a little better. So, yeah, is that something you think you can get back to me with today?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. For sure on a two dollar increase, I can definitely get back to you, by or before the end of day today. I can put it in order form. You can have it processed so we can have that contracted. And you have a paper trail for that as well. On the other hand, you know, when, you know, I'm sure you're if not already, you will be looking out in the market in terms of competitors and I can guarantee that for the kind of value that you've been getting from hiver price point that you're getting it, that there's going to be a lot of tools that might offer, you know, sometimes even a more lesser price, I'll be upfront, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I've been with hiver for eight years, had quite a few of these conversations. Well, I'm sure you will get quite a lot of tools that can help you do similar, sometimes maybe even a little more in terms of what's advertised, the robustness and the stability of the software is something that you can understand for yourself as you start digging through that conversation on like review sites and you start having these discussions as well, right? So while I understand that a price increase is not ideal, I hope you also recognize that we're not effectively looking to normalize you on a plan that you would have to be on just going by the I.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Do understand?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yep. Right. We're just trying to keep it as minimal as possible. So that makes sense in a continuing business perspective while ensuring that it doesn't take too big of a chunk out of your pocket as well.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Yeah, let's do what you can do. If you can give me one dollar increase, then we'll probably walk away a lot happier. And yeah, let me know. I appreciate your time.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure, John, thank you so much for taking the time and for being upfront as well in terms of what your thought process is like. Let me have a discussion with the leadership. Let me get back to you with the counter offer in terms of what that looks like, I will go for it.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  Yeah. All right. Thank you, man. I appreciate your time. I hope you feel better. I really do take.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Care. Thank you. Bye.

John Long (john@printville.net):
  All right. Bye bye.
