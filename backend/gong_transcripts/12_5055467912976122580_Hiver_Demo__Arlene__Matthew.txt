Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hello? Hey, Arlene. How's it going good?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Thanks. How are you, Matthew doing?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good. Doing good. Appreciate you joining here. The agenda for the call today. Just want to spend the first couple minutes or so getting an understanding of what you're looking for, helping you determine if hiver can fit your needs. And then from there, I can walk through the product if it makes sense and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Sure. Oh, it automatically invited firefly. Let me, are you okay with that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's fine, or I can remove it if you want.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  You know, what it's fine, if you're okay with it. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. So you're asking what I'm looking for? Yeah. So basically, we have an app that we've designed and the focus is on content creators and we're you know, we're servicing the world. So we kind of need, I mean, maybe not quite 24 seven coverage, but like a 27 coverage. We're also, for our customer service, we plan on actually staffing it with real people because that's part of the differentiator. And mostly it won't be in the us but we want to be able to, I guess like, you know, in the cases where there's nobody available, we want it to be available on the app and kind of as a first touch point, right? So, so, yeah… and really also making, I guess like the way I see the tool would be as a support for our customer service agents and not replacing them. So we want to be able to make it easy for them to be able to, you know, provide the help that they need to provide the support that they need.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And, and do you, how many customer support people do you have right now? Well?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Right now, we just have one, but we'll expand that. So our, we're still in development, we haven't officially launched yet. So we're still kind of in the like a beta test mode. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. And… are you, do you guys use Google suite or do you use Microsoft? Okay? Google suite? Okay? Got it. So, yeah. So, so the main two channels that, hiver supports email support. So think like shared email addresses, like support at your website, your company? I mean… yeah, we can set that up. Yeah. And the other one that hiver supports is chat. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So those are the, yeah. So those are the main two things that people come to hiver for.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay… great. I have a question. So, you know, how these days people tend instead of like texting, people will just send like a voice note. Do you support that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It would have to, the voice note would have to be have to come in as an email.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. So basically, like if the user records a voice note, then they'll come to us as email. So you'll do like a voice to text?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, no, it would have to be some kind of system that a system outside of hiver that can take voice notes and turn them into emails? Okay?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. So there has to like, it's basically another layer.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah. So hiver, yeah, exactly. So that's what I was saying earlier is hiver only covers email and chat? Okay?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Yep. And we,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  yeah, exactly. So the benefit of hiver is that you just simply log in here. The agents can log in here and you're going to see the emails, the email support channels up here, and then the chat down here on the left.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  So,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  when emails come in, they'll come in here. You're going to have this panel on the right hand side. You can assign it to each other. You can update the statuses, you can apply tags to them. You can put notes in here… and you can reply to the emails. All right here and everybody can see the replies. Okay?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  So, I'm curious to like because we're small and we're just starting out, I'm curious about your free feature, like your free tier. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So actually, yeah, this would be part of the free tier. The free tier is just or if you wanted to have it directly in Gmail. Okay. There's not going to be any chat, but yeah, it would do kind of what I showed you. So basically, you download the hiver extension, you're going to see it down here. You can connect one mailbox, so you can connect one email address to hiver, and then you're going to be able to have a folder that will handle all those emails and you'll be able to assign it to each other and take notes. Okay?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Is there a limit on the number of like chats or emails that the free tier provides?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There's no.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, there's not, there's the only limitation to it is, so if you go on our page, the usage limits down here is the number of emails that you can connect to hiver, You can only connect one email to hiver, one email. Okay. Yeah. So.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  I can connect to my email, but I can still assign them to different agents.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Okay. And then that's pretty much it. So you can track the emails in here. You can assign it to each other, and then you can have this team view here, which you can like see all the emails that your team is working on.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then you have access to the support as well. Okay?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  So, yeah, I'm mostly right now interested in what is covered in the free tier? Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So that's pretty much everything that's in the free tier.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. So, I don't get performance analytics then with the free tier? No?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. So, no.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Performance analytics, no AI agent or chatbot, no.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. It's basically just connecting an email to hiver and then being able to assign it to each other and take notes et cetera. Okay?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  So I can still do the notes. Now, I have a question. Can I pull down like my own data? So I like if I can't if I am, not, if I don't have the analytics functionality within the free tier, is there a way for me to run my own analytics? Do I get the data?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Can you run your own analytics? Not within hiver? Not really, no.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. So there's no easy way to basically monitor my performance without… upgrading, correct? And where, what? I guess, I don't remember, I looked at it, but what tier do I get the analytics?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Second tier or third tier? So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You get some analytics on growth, And then you get all of them on pro?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. What do I get? What's the analytics I get on growth on?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Growth, you get analytics for conversations. So workload and performance. So you get the workload and performance. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  What that, is this is the workload. So like how many emails you got in a certain timeframe, How many new emails you got? How many emails you've resolved in that timeframe, And the performance? So like how long is it taking everybody to assign to each other? How long is it taking everybody to respond? You're also going to see the workload across the team. So like in the past month, we assigned 100 emails to Yukta in the past month. We assigned 79 emails to Cole in the past month. Cole has sent 29 emails… and we'll also show you the performance of each person each agent you have. So what's their average response time? What's their average resolution time?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. Okay. And alright… so, and that one was, I think 25 per user, right?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. And so then, can you go back? All right. And do you provide any pricing for small businesses or startups?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  This is our pricing. Okay.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Can you scroll down a bit? I just want to see under like… okay. So when you say integrations, these are like slack whatsapp? Monday… okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  If you hover over them, it's actually, these ones are Asana, Jira, quickbooks.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And some of the premium ones include Salesforce, Hubspot, And then access to the API. Okay?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  What are they? What would I get with the hiver apis? What am I pulling?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Basically, just the ability to connect a platform to hiver that's not a native integration. Oh, yeah. So basically, if you had another tool that you really want to connect to hiver, but, we don't have the integration, you would have access to the API. Okay. Yeah. So.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  I don't get workflow like rule based automations with the free tier? No?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No. All the, all the workflows are with growth and,

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  up, do I have knowledge base? So like, can I feed it… documents so that the agents would be able to then query that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, it looks like you can do knowledge base but you don't have, you don't have any AI… but you do have access to the knowledge base. And in the free one, it looks like.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. So basically, it's just like they just have like documents that they manually search like there's a search functionality.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So the knowledge base looks something like this where they can search for, and this is our knowledge base, but it's the same in hiver. Basically, you can search and, you can build like these help articles, etc. Okay. And then down the road, you also have the chat feature and these, you can put the chat on your site and these chats would come directly into hiver as well.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. But that's not in the free one though, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. Do I get chat in the free,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it does look like you will get live chat on your, on the free one. Yeah. Okay.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  So, that's just basically like a widget I can put on my app and can I customize with my own logo? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There's a little bit of custom, not much, but there's a little bit of customization available with the free. Yeah. Okay.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  So, like, can I name it like something and have my logo?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'm not 100 percent sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it looks like you can put a widget logo? Okay?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Right. And that's even with the free.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Not 100 percent sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Are you able to check? Yeah, I'll have to, I'll have to ask somebody after the call. Okay?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  All right. So, I'll be curious if I can customize like the logo and the name for the widget. I don't know if you guys name it. Some people do name it.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  OK. I'm just curious. OK. So I get chat, I get the email. I can connect one email to it and I can assign, I don't get analytics and my knowledge base is not AI enabled. It's just like a manual search, regular search function. All right. Okay. Anything else? Like, is there any other features that you want to highlight?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, I think that's pretty much it.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. Is there, okay. So there's no limit on the number of emails and chat supported in the free tier. The only limit is the number of email address. I can connect to it… correct? And… I can, if I wanted to, I can be on the free plan forever. Yep. Okay. And I start to get analytics and growth. Now, can I start, in my knowledge base and growth? Is there, is that an AI enabled?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Not really. It's really the co pilot, that leverages the knowledge base with the AI, so that's more of a pro feature.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Okay. All right. Cool. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yeah, absolutely.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I think, the pro will be a good start. And I'll find out your question for you. And then also, once you to access the pro, you just, you sign up on the pricing page for the free version, and then if you have any questions at all, just reach out to our 24 seven instant chat support directly in your account, and then also, you'll be able to upgrade within your account as well if that time comes. Okay?

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Great. Thank you. Perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Marlene. Have a good one.

Arlene (arlene@adwa.studio):
  Thanks you too. Thanks. Bye bye.
