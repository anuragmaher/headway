Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hello, is this Remya?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Yeah, good afternoon. This is Remya.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, good afternoon. How are you?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  I'm fine. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well, thank you.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Yeah, I'm just waiting for Dinesh to join because he's leading the show. So to introduce myself, I'm the executive director for governance and pmo. So I'm looking into because it comes under me. I'm just looking into the software, also applications. So we'll just wait till Dinesh comes in.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Joins, yeah. Got it. Let's wait for him and then we can get started?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Sure. Yeah, thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Thank you. In the meantime, Remya. Could you help me understand a bit about your company? What exactly you're looking for? Because as I'm trying to search for the domain, I'm not able to go to your website.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Yeah. Actually what's happening is like our website, our company name is in our space private limited. Now, it has been three months back, it has been renamed as aeonark private limited. It is a 10 years old company. And where we are looking into co working space, then we have our real estate businesses, then eco tourism and the it developers related tasks. So you can search your company profile, the name of like in our space private limited. Yet to rename. We have received the name change from the mca, that is ministry of corporate affairs. So it will be, our website is under construction. So it is under developing stage. So it will be evident in your internet shortly. And so this is a company where we have four verticals and all the four verticals are working towards that. And why we need this. It ticketing system is like it is everything is done either verbally or through mail. So the main purpose why I need this is like, for example, we have clients over here and also we have our employees over here. So any issues or any complaints being raised, it is being done on. It is not done on the priority prices. So it can be like every complaint or anything ticketing is raised. It can be like urgency based or severe. So even though the concerned end user raises a ticket, it can be decided by… the it team whether it comes under high priority, medium or low priority. So that we need in the it ticketing system, I refer this, I recommend this because we need to have a standardized process to have this entire it ticketing system in online methodology. So that the, when the clients or even the employees who need this can raise accordingly and then they can come into a conclusion. So there are many features because I basically came from industries where this ticketing system has there. So since here, we have not practiced this ticketing system yet. So we just thought like, yes, this is a main domain area where we'll be concentrating on getting the ticketing system in one place because everything is done either on the mail format or on the verbal issue thing. It can be a client or it can be employee. And even though what we do in it team that admin, which means mr Dinesh who does is like one, it is not done on the priority price. Any complaints being raised. It is being handled then and there, I would recommend because the company is expanding, I would recommend the it ticketing system where he can specifically mention whether it is on priority, high priority, medium or low priority, even though the end user specifies that it is high priority. The it admin can even segregate that. And there's a timeline intimation. Information, and there is a closure of the ticketing, where he can even have the closure report where he can download that, how many issues has been escalated or how many issues has been raised for past one month, and what is the issues being handled and how it was handled, everything we need into the application format or the tool format. So that's the main thing. We just thought like we need to have this it ticketing system and Dinesh would have coordinated you to have this done. So, this is a short orientation about what we need from you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Thank you so much for that. Remya. Hi, Dinesh. How are you?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Yes, ma'am, I'm good.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, Remy, you are the executive director, right? You're at your own mark. And what about Dinesh? Hello? Are you from the it team?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Looking after the it team? Dinesh is from the it team, you can start, but we both, we will be looking into your demo… and then we will be projecting to our corner.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And could you explain as like today when you receive all the requests through emails, do you have a generic email address at which everyone writes whether it's your customers or internal employees?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Yeah, we have a common email id. It, so under the name of Dinesh at aeonnark. Com. So all the clients give them like any kinds of complaints to the same?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So everybody writes to Dinesh itself. So he's the only one who's currently managing the entire.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Yeah, he is managing the entire show. Okay? He's leading the team and he's doing the serve. So all the mail comes to him. So, is,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  he the only one who's going to be using this tool as well?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  No tool can be seen. We need to, we don't have the tools like everyone can raise a complaint or it can be from the,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  tool itself.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  She, I mean, from the clients, all the clients gives to him and she does it individually. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What exactly do you need? Do you want a tool that helps you sort of for Dinesh to be able to manage all the tickets from one platform itself, whether it, if something is coming via email or a phone call, or you want for the customers and for your employees as well to have a portal?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  I'll just elaborate actually, we need a tool where the clients or the customer and employees can raise a ticket.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you want to give them a portal as well, right? Yeah, a portal?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Has to be given where a lead individual can raise a ticket. Okay? And it can be, it has to be escalated to the issues of the entire IP system. Where he, for example, if I'm the end user, I'll be just mentioning that, my vertical, my department lacks all the things. We need, all the things. And then I'll be mentioning that for me, this is like high priority. And I had to mention the reason is like why I'm mentioning as a high priority, then it gets expected to finish if budget is involved or.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It has to, he.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  needs to get approved from the founder or the next level. Then it goes to the approval level and the upload people will give the approve approving details and then the niche with what they should be doing is like he will be resegregating whether it comes at high priority, medium or low, and then with the timeline for completion. If it can be internal campaign closure or it can be external at the extra vendors involved. If that's so, then the entire system should have like which vendor they are coordinator, and which is the, and when it's expected due that due date for completion of this entire task and how if it is completed, then auto escalation, which means if I am the end user, then if the problem is solved, I should get a mail or I should get information that, yes, your problem has been rectified with. So and so justification has to be specified. The entire loop has to be completed. It can be complaint based or it with complete base. It can be some issues or it can be a server breakdown, whatever no mobile communication we are entertaining. We need to have an entire system which can be used. The portal can be used for the end user, which is a client or the employees and also got it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. I understood. So mostly you're looking for a task management also, right? With this customer rights to, you would also want to take them through the entire cycle of how much time it takes to, for you and from your site to resolve that… that's coming in, right? And that will involve a lot of different people. Dinesh is just going to be the point of contact initially to be, you know, segregating these tickets and allocating those and then keeping a track on how much time we are taking to, you know, keep a, to actually complete that. So, I think you're looking more of an itsm tool rather than a ticketing solution because with hiver, what you would be able to do and why it is being used mostly is when you want to manage your emails wherein the requests are coming in, you have probably let's say five people, 10 people in a team who are responsible to close that those emails right there. And then that's where a tool like hiver will be useful to you, right? I'll show you quickly that.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Is also required. I just gave an additional points on this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I'll just show you and let me know if this works for you. So, since you're hosted on Gmail, hiver sits right on top of your Gmail, and that's where you can manage the entire workflow on this particular inbox that you have, generally, we have more than one person and that's where the requirement to have a shared mailbox comes in. We will create one of the shared inboxes like you see on the left side of my screen. I have these couple of sharing boxes that I am part of like finance healthcare info support. If I take an example of the support inbox here, let's say we connect that with Dinesh's. Email address. Anyone who writes to this email address, now in hiver, you wouldn't find it as a typical ticketing solution. Whenever someone writes to this email, your emails do not turn into a ticket. They remain as emails only although you would have ticket number associated with each email. So you always have a conversation id. You can also enable a autoresponder so that whenever someone writes to this email address, they get a auto response stating that, you know, thank you for reaching out to us. We will be getting back to you. And from there, what happens is once anyone writes to this email address, you would be receiving those in this section called unassigned, right? Which means these are unassigned emails. And from there, you would have this activity panel on the right side and this will allow you to then be able to prioritize your emails. Dinesh can segregate whether this email should be a high priority email or it should be a medium priority or a low priority, we can create that custom field for you and then accordingly within the team who needs to work on this email is something that you have to give the ownership to. I'm, still not sure whether you would want to invite everyone into this inbox itself so that amongst everyone, you can then assign those tickets between who needs to work on this and you can just pass those tickets to them. So let's say, I assign this ticket to myself. This is.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  One second. Sorry for the interruption. Can this process be done in the teams… in where? No, instead of Gmail, I'm just asking whether all this, that's what are you guys?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hosted on Google workspace or Microsoft?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  No, it's Microsoft. Oh, you're.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hosted on Microsoft that's fine. We have a Microsoft product as well. Yeah. I think in the form you had mentioned, Gmail, right?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Yeah.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is outlook only. Okay. My mistake. No worries. So we have two products. One is for Gmail, and one is for outlook. For outlook. We have hiver for Omni, wherein the whole process is going to be same. That's what I have just showed you. It's just going to be connected or you'll be logging in using your outlook credentials rather than Gmail. Everything else will remain the same. Let me just share my screen. Okay? So this is how it's going to look like you will be logging in using app, hiverhq. Com. You will be logging in using your outlook credentials. Like I've done here, you would have your shared inboxes. So like I was taking an example of the support inbox, it's going to look the same wherein you would be able to assign your emails. We can create these custom fields. So instead of escalation, we can have a priority field here, which will help you sort of.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Is there?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  A question one?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Second?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Are your family in Tamil? No?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Just hold on. I have an internal discussion.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Okay. So, sorry?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you hear us? Yes. Yeah.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  So, we have it out. For example, you just mentioned about the URL of the top, right? So, is this URL being used as a CRM tool or it's only a link which can be done on exclusive for the it ticketing system?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is for this URL is where you will log into hiver. So this is hiver interface. Basically this.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Is not a CRM, right? No, no, no.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's not a CRM. It's a hiver interface wherein you will be logging in to manage your shared inbox here. So, like, and in here, you wouldn't have the ticket number or ticket id. This is purely to manage your shared inbox, basically, which I think is not something you're looking for because it's just Dinesh who is currently handling. You? Don't have a generic email address, you want a portal for your customers and for employees to raise tickets from. This is not only employees.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Even the clients also can raise the tickets. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So that's not something that this will cover for you. Yeah.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Okay. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Here, you're basically creating a shared inbox connecting any email address that's generic being shared by different people in the team. And then from there, once you've connected, you log in here using your credentials, and then from there, you can do everything that you do in a ticketing tool, assign those tickets, track status, create tags to differentiate what type of ticket. This is. You can go into analytics to look at different metrics like what you mentioned, the conversation, how the workload distribution has been amongst different individuals who have worked on a specific ticket. So all of this you will then find under reporting. So, yeah, this is how the platform looks like. You let me know if this is something that you're looking for or something else.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Yeah. We are looking for the same thing. We are not looking for the CRM concept. We're just looking for any kind of link or any kind of thing where it can be integrated into our nmius, and then even that can be used for them to raise the ticket economy.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This will not be integrated anywhere you.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Will be this update link, right? Exactly.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's a URL, basically how you open a new tab to go to use an application. So, this is a browser based application of hiver. So this is hiver interface. This cannot be integrated anywhere else.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  All right. Okay. Fine. Yeah. Please continue, this, is it?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is it from my side. You tell me if you have any questions, any more questions? Can you just give.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  me a demo? Like how in the same URL? Like how the tickets can be raised from the end user? And how it reaches the, it admittance this?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is how it looks like we will create the share inbox which will be connected to this email address, which is currently being used of Dinesh. Anyone who writes to this email address, those tickets, those emails are going to come into this unassigned section?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Okay. So you mean that if I need a complaint, I have to go through email only. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  There is only email. There is only one way that anyone can raise a ticket here. Okay? So.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Normally, what happens is there should be a separate tool, right? Which would be integrated in the mis, where you can, for identical pieces, it can be the desktop or somewhere where they can click it out. Even in the shortcut. We can just mention in the entire home page where the email, it says, it will be a separate application and not email. Is that possible? No, I think.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What you're looking for is a separate portal for everyone to be able to raise a ticket. Yeah, that's.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  right. I'm just looking into that because yeah, if Dinesh doesn't take this role, then automatically, the plan goes, for example, if Dinesh resigns from the job, then his mail is blocked even.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  If you have a portal to raise a ticket on, you, still, that portal will be connected to any email address, right? So you have to first change the email address to a generic email address. Currently, you're using Dinesh's email address. But if you want to create this as a more centralized or a streamlined process, you first have to introduce a it email address, right? Which is, which could be an it at the rate support at the rate or any of those email addresses. So that anyone who writes to you, they will either write to this email address directly that's one way or if you are giving them a portal also even if they are on a portal, when they raise a ticket, that will also be directed to this email address, only, right? And then on that email address, anyone can log in. If you are using hiver in hiver, you have to connect your email addresses. So everybody who is part of hiver logs in using their email address, and that's how they're accessing the shared inbox, for any ticketing tool which has its own interface, which works, wherein you can log in using the same credentials in that interface. You will still be logging in using your it at the rate email address. And then anyone who has those credentials can work on those tickets. So either way, you will have to introduce a separate email address, which is, you know?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  And my question is, for example, if I am the end user, I can just send a normal mail addressing him that I have this issue. Or should I be just you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can just write an email that's it. Okay? So.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  He has, so Dinesh will get like, normally he will be getting all the mails then he has to go and do the series segregation of that, then he had to identify which is he. So how will I, and I know that if the issues has been completed?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So like in this mailbox that you have, you will add all the individual, all the team members who want to be part of it, who need to have the visibility, right? Whoever is part of it, everybody is going to be able to then manage these emails which are being written at the same address. When you open any email, you will, he will then be able to assign those tickets among different individuals. You can track the status from here. Whether it's an open email, it's pending or it's closed. You can prioritize these emails. And if you're part of this as well, you can see all of it. And then basically, you can do everything. Whoever is part of this shared inbox will have the complete visibility and can manage this inbox through doing different functionalities here. Okay. All right.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Okay. It's so if I am the end user and if my complaint has been closed, I have to go here and search for this and to analyze whether my complaint has been cleared or not, correct? Your.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  End user does not have the access to this. This is solely for your team to manage these.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Yeah. Okay. But the end user, how the notification or the information is reaching the end user?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Either, what you can do is whenever your type, whenever you're working on any ticket, let's say I'm working on this ticket, I hit reply. I send the response to the customer, whatever that I need to write here. And then at the end, I can just let them know that this is being closed from our side. And if you have any other query, you can just reach out to us. You you send this response and then you come here and you close this ticket from your side. So your end user, if you're looking for something to give the visibility to your end user, also that they should have a portal wherein they can see whether the ticket is open closed. Pending. That is something that we don't have currently. So this is only for your team management of these tickets that are coming in your end users, your customers, your employees, they will just have one way to reach out to you. It's going to be through this email that you will give them. And whenever they write to you, then your team will pick it up from this centralized inbox. And then they will just respond to these queries as they come. Okay?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  I'll have a talk with my founder because they're just looking into a separate tool based, and I just put forward this also to them like integrating in the email. So that is easy for the team to get connected in that. Okay. So what about the subscriptions of your product? I just wanted.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  To also understand like today, you mentioned Dinesh is the only person who is responsible for managing these tickets? Is it yeah?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  For the support?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Function? So if you create a central inbox, let's say you're not going to use Dinesh's email address, you introduce a new email?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  We have, we have a central centralized email you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Have that, what is it called? Yeah, it?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Is an it supporter? We had to be used by the client even though if he is also not there, I mean anyone who takes a role will be doing the same. So we have a supply chain perfect. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  If you have an email address, so we will connect that email address and create the share inbox. Could you help me understand? Like how many people would you want to invite to that share inbox?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  We are an employee of 35 and we have a client of nearly 250. So, which means 300 will be the current count. No, so here.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  In this shared inbox, you will not have to invite your customers, your employees, everyone, you just have to invite the people who are going to be working on these tickets on a day to day basis. What's the size of the team who's going to work on these tickets?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Okay. Which means our it team, we have three members who are working on it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. There are three people got.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  It, yeah, because we have developers, but this, it admin role is taken by three members under the leadership of Dinesh?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Cool. So, in terms of the pricing, we have different tiers of plans.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  As you can see on the screen. We have the free plan growth pro elite. We have a minimum bucket of five users. So to start with, we sell in an increment of five. So the minimum number of users that you would have to onboard is going to be five pricing is per user per month model. So it's going to cost. So, you mean?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  The free cost with five members is like five it admins, people, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Anyone who needs to be part of this inbox. Okay?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Right. I understood. Okay. So this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is what the cost looks like?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Okay. So these are users, right? Which means we have to include all the 300 members, correct?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  They are not counted. They are just going to write to you. The only thing matters is who?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Are, so, which means three members. The people who take up this task of it admin is three members. So three members will be the persons, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Like whoever needs to be on hiver, are going to be the users basically.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Okay. Could.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Be the it admin. It could be you also, if you want to be part of it, whoever needs to be part of hiver, they have to buy the license. Okay?

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Understood. Yeah.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  All right. So, I'll just have a talk with my management and Dinesh will be updating you on the same problem before this meeting. Yeah, perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let me know what the feedback is and accordingly, we can connect. Sure we'll do that. All right. Thank you. Take care.

Fireflies.Ai Notetaker Dinesh:
  Thank you. Take care. Bye bye. Thank you.
