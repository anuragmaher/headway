================================================================================

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  hi, Ola.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Hi wander.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Hey, how are you doing?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Everything's fine. Thank you. It's finally Friday.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Oh, yes. Finally, it's Friday indeed. Pleasure to meet you. Once again. Now, the main agenda of today's, call is to discuss the commercials for the AI add on that we spoke about in detail last time.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Right. Yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  And besides that, do you have anything else that you would like to add to the agenda of today's session?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  No, we can speak only about AI add ons today. Yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So I also have Raghav who's just joined the call and Raghav is the account manager and he would be the one talking.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  The commercial side of things. I'll be the one talking more on the usage side of things right before I wanna get into the usage. I wanted to check like last time we enabled like I walked you through the co pilot, I spoke about some of the other features besides the AI tagging and the AI sentiment. We also spoke about how you can use AI to draft an email. How has that been working for your team?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  No, AI features are currently helping us. In particular, we appreciate the AI tagging and the AI co pose and the AI tagging works pretty well, but not all text. But for example, I see that this is in Da, or this is in voices contracts or execution or something like that. But AI compose, I don't know why, but only me and like some of my colleagues use it as a matter of fact, I demonstrated it to many times how it worked, but they… do not use it. I personally find AI compose very helpful. I use it every day almost.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome. That's good to hear. What do you think we can change so that your other team members can also find the same value in AI compose that you find?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  I don't know this is about their intent and willingness to use it. Maybe they work with chat gpt or they don't need to compose with AI drafting some mails. This is my problem that my English is not very well. So I use AI to improve my text.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  That could be one possibility. Yes, absolutely. Even I use AI compose pretty well because I'm really bad at writing emails. So it definitely helps me out. Absolutely. So I just want to check with you in terms of the AI co, pilot side of things. Have you gotten the time to test it? Did you get the time to put up some documents, especially some of your legal documents to see if it's providing the right information while responding to emails?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  You know, the problem is we are more interested in tools that will review our agreements or something like that because this is 80 percent of our work. Remember some use cases when we can upload some document which we can refer for our responses because most of our work is reviewing contracts. We have some checklists for reviewing and some general understanding. I can find use cases when we can upload something or you can advise how ascii may improve our agreements review because this is the most important things in our work. The rest of things like we don't have some like knowledge base because the base is basically some researches which we need to date. And despite… we have some something because we need to provide to our projects actual information up to date. If you have something that's okay. But we need to check it to update, and so on.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Okay. So if I've understood you correctly, Ola, you need a AI feature wherein you can upload an agreement or a contract with one of your suppliers maybe, and that AI feature will check with your existing organizations norms or legal requirements if it meets it, and then give you a confirmation if that's good to go or not. Is that my right understanding?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Not a confirmation but some red lines some, how to change it or provide new clauses or something like that. Based on our instructions. Understood within our organization, our education team already provided us. They developed some LLM for us but it worked very well. So we are currently using some like chatgpt or some special tools for drafting for legal drafting. So of the… like use cases, we don't know how we can utilize our ski currently. Unfortunately because I think this is more created for support teams which have some instructions or drafts for reply or some knowledge in base like some knowledge information which they can provide to clients. Our specific is like different?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Understood. No, I can definitely take that as a feature request. So you'd like for you to whenever you'll download an agreement, you'll want to run it through like an AI checker and wherever it's not aligned with your instructions, you would like for the AI checker to highlight those points within the agreement, so that you can then go ahead and review it, make changes on those specific points, right?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Yes, we can check how it works and if this AI tool works good and according to our instructions or maybe some generic information or some logic, yes, not only instructions but, you know, whether the contracts is okay for like particular counterparty for us or if there are some concerns or risks they can highlight to us. Yes, it would be very helpful for us because we are a legal team and we have some another specific in our work.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So, Olga, just jumping in here, Leander, Olga, can you like, if you don't mind, do you have an example that you can show us? You know, the reason I'm asking is because the AI extract versus AI tasks are two things or two approaches that we're working on as actions on hiver, right? AI extract is something that's available right now, but I want to get a better sense of what you're talking about if you can with an example. So when we do talk with our team, it will help us to have that example and then be like, hey, this is what Olga and her team would like to do or want to do. Like for example, could you like maybe open a contract and show us what might be the things you usually check for and what would be beneficial from an AI angle?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  I can, if the team will allow me, I can provide our checklist and you can go through and understand whether this checklist is about some particular features. We can update or remove the counterparty text and upload other texts or some generic things like what should be in indemnity clause, or what should be in liability clause? Some examples, and so on.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. If you can send us over that information over email, that'll be really great. But I do want to set the expectation as well that this will not be something that is readily available on the hiver AI as of today or, you know, when we do agree on commercials, right? I want to set the expectations that this will be a potential enhancement on the AI for hiver, more future state as opposed to something that will be included in the discussion of commercials that we'll be having today in the near future. Yeah, just want to make that pretty clear. I,

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  don't know whether we are ready to buy it right now.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. No, definitely got it. And, you know, from a general perspective of, you know, how your team uses the AI side of things. The one thing you had mentioned was checklist, hiver, looking at a document, looking at specific information, updating it within hiver fields and also giving your team members suggestions on, hey, ask for this. Ask for this. This one's missing. What other type of AI do you use now? You said chatgpt for writing, making conversations better and making just the email writing part better as an experience. Now within your legal team, what else do you use that you rely on AI today outside of hiver as well?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Also make some researches, legal researches, but with improvements… search improvements in our case because I may hallucinate or provide information. So they help us to find some information quickly but which needs to be approved. And… for certain cases or some legal documents, we use some specific tools like relax or spellbook or something like that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. And apart from hiver, I'm sorry if you've already had this question asked by Leander, apart from hiver, what other softwares do you use as a team? Now, when you say AI, is it like an AI agent that you've built in house? Is it like chatgpt? Google gemini?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Yeah, gemini. We have our internal AI tool for reviewing contracts, but currently, it works not as we want. Okay, we use like vilex for legal research… quote, sometimes perplexity.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Cloud perplexity. I use perplexity pretty heavily for my research for my job as well. That makes sense. And so, you know, when we're talking about AI, Olga, I do want to ask you to also think about operational efficiency as of today, right? So, you know, in a general AI sense, hiver is looking at two different categories broadly where we're working on AI enhancements. One is what we call AI agents and that's more for operational ease, making processes simpler and making it easier for the team to handle internal stuff on hiver that's where tagging comes in, you know, that's where AI QA is something we're working on that's going to be helpful for what you ask for, you know, better writing, making sure you have a report, making sure that checklists are met. Things like that. Now, when it comes to communication, does your team frequently interact with external vendors and outside third party people or is it mostly internal within Genesis media departments?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Oh, can you repeat your question because I couldn't understand. What do you mean?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sorry, my bad. So let me rephrase in your team's everyday emails, right? The emails that your team handles, are these emails from internal members of the company like your company or is it also external people that you?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Also external like our service providers, right? Mostly service providers or other future employees. But mostly, we speak within Genesys domain or domain of our projects or within organization. This is most of our communication.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Great. So then in that sense, it's a typical legal team scenario. You work with GTM teams, go to market teams, revenue teams internally. And then you work with service providers which are your external players as well. And so when it comes to handling the whole legal process for your business, do you use any kind of portal, you know, something like ziphq or coupa or something like that as well?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  No, no.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And if you don't mind me asking, where does that information stay for today? Like if you want to go back and pull up hiver as a supplier's, information, msas, documents, things like that, where does that live?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  You mean when I need to review?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Legal terms, review, terms of service, red lines, things like that?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  What I use in this case?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. What would you use in this case? Yes.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Oh, every team member use what they find helpful for them personally, I use chatgpt in most of the cases.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Other llms like gemini or we have some add ons which our head of legal proposed. But personally, I use chatgpt and our internal checklist.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Makes sense. Right? Got it. Thanks for that. Olga. And one more question, Olga and I'm just trying to make sure I understand this detail so that when I talk to my team, we have features that will actually help you that we come back to you with and you can explore it for the future stage, right? When it comes to the legal documentation, you know, reviewing the checklist, making the document align with the checklist, terms of service based on your business needs for all of those. Do you have like Google drive folders, sharing documents? Is that how you handle it? Yes. Yeah.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Handles through Google drive. We recently transferred from Dropbox and now integrated everything with Google drive. That's all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  We have Google drive, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. No, that makes sense. All right. Understood. And in terms of, you know, internal discussions within your team as well because you said two types of interactions you have, one is external vendors and one is internal team members, right? When it comes to internal team members, apart from hiver, is there another task management or project management system? You use something like Monday com or Asana or confluence, or clickup maybe?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  No, no. We tried to integrate but the team was against every… team… member use task manager, they prefer. And we tried to integrate click up but team… was against and they, we still manage our task as everyone prefers, got.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It got it. So there's no central task management that you use across the team. It's just individual preferences at this point. Yes. Okay. Makes sense. Do you see a place where you might have a central task management tool in the future as a team? Just, I'm… curious on that front.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  If it would be hiver, I think it would be.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You know?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Mostly of our tasks come from email and I personally use hiver as my personal task manager because I find it very helpful, very useful. Helpful. Of course, this is not perfect because I can't put some deadlines. I can't prioritize my tasks, but at least I see all my tasks on screen and I don't need to go to clickup to Asana to anywhere else my tasks are in your system. But maybe this is for your to think about maybe to integrate into hiver, some task manager or make something to help to add some additional text because we have not only tasks from email, we have tests from compliance.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  From like IP sphere or we have some more strategic tasks which we receive through email, but we handle it also. And however, unfortunately, it's not enough to handle all other tasks because it's very good for handle operational, tasks which our email, but.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  some opportunity.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  To handle strategic tasks, I.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  understand now, I hear where you're coming from. You know, the reason why I asked that question is because with the eight years that I've spent at hiver and all the different customers I've spoken to legal teams usually need like a standard task management, you know, clickup or Asana or something like that. And that's mostly because like you said, you know, there's strategic tasks that need a timeline that need a Gantt or a kanban view and you can track completion, completely, right? And hiver can be an addition at that stage where it helps you track the stages while you have that full picture on that side of things that makes sense. All right. And Olga just one more question before I give you an idea of, you know, how we can, or at least we discuss how we can plan next steps from here, right? So, you know, when you told me that you have internal tasks from it, from compliance. I'm sure there will be some tasks from sales and marketing as well, or revenue teams, when suppliers are renewing, when you're onboarding new suppliers, and even HR for employees as well. Is there any kind of a Google form or somewhere that you get those requests or do they just send it as emails? And you'll go from there currently?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  We work through emails, all organizations know, our organizations organization know our email, legal gantag, and then all requests are handled through legal contact email.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. No, that makes sense. All right. Olga. So the way I'm thinking about it is that there are some hiver features that can actually step one, help you make this incoming request structured in a better way, right? Because if your expectation at the end of the day is to have better task management capabilities, hiver is, I'll be very straight with you, right? Hiver is not a task management tool, so it can't do 100 percent of what something like a clickup or an Asana or even Monday can do. But on the other hand, if we can structure or clearly tell requests from it, requests for certain documentation, reason for request, it's for this, you know, hardware that I'm procuring and this is the deadline, you know, basic information. If we can have that received to your team more clearly and that, you know, shows up in hiver more clearly. I'm sure we can automate or even look at a step more, one more step of deeper task assignment and task management. Again, just going at it one step at a time compared to where you are today, right? And just making sure hiver gets better there as well. This is more from an everyday regular hiver usage. And in addition to that, I think if we add AI, it might make more sense that's how I'm thinking about it. Olga, do you think this makes sense from what you're seeing based on your team's reactions and your usage of hiver so far? Something like this, do you think it would help if we start discussing and send you some suggestions on how to go about it?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  So as do I understand, correct? So you propose me to engage in some communication regarding how to make hiver as task manager? Yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No. So we said that we will be able to give you some suggestions on how to make first level of tasks grow up in hiver better? And like I said, you know, we're not a hiver is not a full task management software. So it can't do something like a clickup can do or a Monday com can do. But we can at least look at small changes and tweaks to how you're doing things today that can help you make the first task creation easy, make the first task tracking easy?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Right. Yes, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  very good. Because I personally think that hiver can be our task manager. And if we work together to implement to hiver, some features that hiver works from clickup from Asana and make it the comprehensive task manager. It'd be cool, super and, very cool for our team.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely, capacity.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  To use Asana and so on because we are, very busy and we, very time.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that makes so much sense. And especially with December coming I'm sure you have a lot of documents and a lot of checklist to review as well after today's, call. So, Olga, what I'd like to end today's call with is what we would need from you is if you can send us that checklist, some examples and some, you know, example scenarios, right? Like step one document comes in, this is what we check for. This is the checklist based on this checklist, this is what we would see. And if you could give us some idea on what that full picture would look like including the tasks as well. If you can send that over to us on an email or like a document or something that'll be really great because that'll help me and Leander understand and conceptualize or visualize, how can hiver better help you on that front? And when we're discussing that, we can definitely look at how AI can help you reduce the work your team has to do as well along the way, right? And that way we can keep discussions open and we can have a commercial discussion on AI down the line because from what you're telling me so far from what I've heard, I don't think it makes sense for us to talk commercials at this stage without having some kind of clarity on how a hiver can improve your process and be your process itself and what that looks like. That's what I'm thinking? Yeah.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Definitely. Yes, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Perfect. So, Olga, then I think from the hiver side, you know, you've got the pricing on the website that is list prices. What I'd like to do is spend maybe a week on whatever information you send us, discuss that internally. Maybe come back to you with a suggestion, probably third week of November, if not the week after.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And then we can have a discussion about if AI is needed for this, what would the cost be for that? And then we can go down that discussion route. What do you think?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Yeah. Okay. We can come back to discussion. But if we need to pay extra money, you understand, I need to prove my team that is necessary. And this really can help to reduce our time on our tasks.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Because if.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  I can't prove it, sorry, maybe we are not agreed to pay extra money.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely, Olga. I'm with you there 100 percent, which is why before I gave you any kind of price, I wanted to see how the whole AI and hiver and any extra money can add value before we start talking about extra money, right? So I wanted to take a quick step back, unpack this or discuss this in a little bit more detail. And then we can come together with a more clearer plan and then work towards value, how you can discuss that with your team and then talk about what's the extra cost you're and what that's going to look like. Okay?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Perfect.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So that's it from my end. So I'm going to pass it back to Leander considering we have a couple more minutes but Olga, as next steps from your side, could you just send us that process in itself? You know, checklist? Step one, step two, what does your team do after step one? What kind of tasks do you create? Any kind of clarity? You can give us on the full picture or the full start to finish handling of a legal request, one for external one for internal, that will give us as much information as we need to give you that idea. And then we can work on having a value added for extra money and how we can look at that from there. So we look forward to hearing for that. I mean, getting that from you for now that's it for me. Leander back to you. Thanks Olga. Thank.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  you.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Thanks Raghav. So, you know, great next steps by Raghav. What I'd like to do is I'd like to follow up on this conversation and just make sure that we are, you know, getting having progress, and moving in the right direction. So, I can expect, you know, for, to hear back from you with the name with what you'd like to see with that specific workflow in the next week or so and we'd like to discuss that internally. Can we set up a tentative meeting on our calendar for maybe the twelfth of December so that we can just, you know, pick up on this conversation and update each other as to where things stand and if not, we can move it at a later date. Yeah. So can I put up a tentative meeting on the twelfth of December at the same time?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Yes, all.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Right. Perfect. I'll go ahead and get that done. Do you have any questions for us for in spec specifically in regards to the AI add on?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  No, currently, no. So, I need to provide our checklist. First, this is regarding AI features. Yes. And second, I need to provide how information, how we handle our internal and external requests and how we handle our strategics tasks. So to implement it into like steps for our for, however as a task manager.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's right? Yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Essentially, what we'd like to understand is how we can have hiver's AI functionality, add value to your team, so that your team has less work to do and focus on more of, you know, the legal things rather than having to get these mundane tasks done. So just help AI drive efficiencies within your team. Okay?

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Okay.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  All right, perfect. Well, thanks for your time. All our pleasure. Meeting you as always and wishing you a great weekend ahead. We'll speak soon. Thank you. You.

Olha Semeniuk (semeniuk.olha@gen.tech):
  Bye bye.
