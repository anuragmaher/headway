Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Courtney.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Hi. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Doing well.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice. I appreciate you hopping on the call here today.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Yeah, no problem.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But just to set a quick agenda, Courtney, we'd love to start with a quick round of introductions, understand your role, what got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demo, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps. But just to introduce myself first, my name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the email management client experience space for a little over six years now working with companies like Salesforce and meta. And yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we could help you all today.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Okay. So my name is Courtney. I've been with airsea packing for I guess about nine years now and I manage our domestic team. We're a logistics company. And so we've really experienced a lot of growth recently and that's also come with a large uptick in emails that my team is trying to kind of cope with right now and manage the workflow. So we've started looking around at programs to see if we could just make this a little more organized with fewer notifications.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And just to understand that further, so, are you working out of shared mailboxes, distribution lists? Can you walk me through how the team is supporting emails today?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Sure. So we each have our own email address right now, we're using distribution lists for most of our larger clients and I've only set up two shared inboxes based on those lists in hiver. But really, you know, we have, I would say like maybe over 10 distribution lists set up specifically for certain clients. So basically like a client will ask for a quote. It'll go to one of my colleagues. He books it, and then if they decide to proceed within that same email chain, my team will take over and it will get assigned to one of us.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many people are working through these emails today on your team? Like how many people would need access to hiver?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  So, directly right now, it would be five including me that being said each of our offices also uses their, these distribution groups, to service our clients. So if it, you know, worked out, I could see it becoming more widespread.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And so, and you'll need six off the start to manage. So you'll need six distribution lists that you're looking to manage for your team?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Okay. No. So, a team of five including me and for the distribution lists, we have three right now that are our main lists that see the most traffic, the three that I've set up in hiver. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, I can hop into a product demonstration here. Courtney, just give you a rundown of hiver. So you're aware of everything that it has to offer and how it can help your team better manage, you know, those emails that are coming in, but taking a look at my screen here, right? You know, on the left hand side, you're gonna see a couple different things, one, the personal inbox, so we can integrate with Microsoft's personal email communications here. And then below that are the distribution lists or shared mailboxes, you know, that we're gonna help you manage as an organization. So I'll click into the support mailbox here. And when I do, it opens up some sub views beneath it that helps us manage the intake. So the first is the mind view, everything that's been assigned to me. Then there's the unassigned new emails that have hit that distribution list that need to be distributed via automation or manual assignment. And then there's the team view. So understanding whatever on the team is working on in real time with the status open and what needs to be completed… just wanna pause here. Courtney, any questions so far?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  No, I've been playing around with it for the past few days. So like I have a basic understanding. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So going into the mind, right? I'm working through this email and a hiver tab opens up on the right hand side where we can, you know, organize a couple of different things, right? The first is assigning a conversation. In this case, I'll assign it to myself. The next way we can assign work is a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the emails amongst your team as they come in. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So maybe we've identified an email that has certain keywords in it or certain key phrases, you know, we're gonna route it to that person to work at? Maybe we've identified an email from a certain client that we wanna go to. You know, Courtney… how do you envision the routing happening in your world? Would it be more of a round Robin equal distribution?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Ideally, the thing is it always starts with my one colleague who's in charge of quoting and that was actually one of the areas of concern. How we would do the handoff because we're all on this distribution group. So let's say he gets his quote request, it's assigned to him. You know, he sends the quote, it's marked as complete. I did set up an automation so that if someone replied to the closed job, it would reopen but is there any way to I guess automatically change the assignment from him to unassigned whenever like a closed job goes from closed to open?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, yeah. So if it goes from closed to open, you can do send closed and unassigned. Okay. So if you send an email and then you close in unassigned, the next time someone reaches out to a thread, it'll go to the unassigned section.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that's a good workflow for that. And then we can track like the status whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks and that we're working through these to a resolution, adding those tags for organizational purposes. So you can use these to track queues and where things are in status to create views for your team. And then custom fields. So showing dropdown fields, date range fields, text box fields, value fields to organize conversations. And then the last is the collaborative aspect. So being able to collaborate being like, hey, matt, you can take it from here. Maybe it provides more information and even reroute the conversation. Let's say to matt. Okay, want to pause here? What are your thoughts on this so far?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  So honestly, we've been so busy recently that we haven't been able to really devote as much time to like trying it out as I would have liked. So I think we're still like very much in the decision making process of like, you know, what platform we want to use or if we even need a platform, which is why I just wanted to learn a little bit more about it today.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And I'm happy to extend the trial until the 20 second to give you some more time with it. Okay? Would that be enough time to get your team back in there and start testing?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Yeah. I think that would work.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. So I just extended that as well to give you some more time to test. We also do provide some onboarding experience as well. So if you did sign up for hiver, you know, we can help you get set up and point the team in the right direction for implementation and team training.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we do have some great analytics as well, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So just really understanding things like, you know, workload and performance metrics. So let's say we want to take a look at, you know, the last 90 days of data of this support distribution list here. We can see active new resolve conversations. You know, what our average first response time was as a team, our average resolution time per user metrics, emails assigned, per user email sent out per user, and then their individual performance metrics below like average first response and average resolution time. And then the tag analytics, you know, what are the requests our team is facing? What bottlenecks are we facing? And the themes that we're seeing across each and every distribution list? Is there anything that you would be looking for specifically Courtney from reporting?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  You know, I would be interested in analytics on like response times?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that would be these right here. So showing the per user, average response times, first response and resolution time. So it's taking me 378 hours to respond to an email. When it gets assigned to me. I'm probably not going to have my job on Wednesday. And then we're also showing aggregate response metrics like just overall performance from a first response or resolution time across that support distribution list. And then the admin panel, you know, where you'll set all this up.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You know, managing the members is the round Robin auto assignment that will equally distribute it and you've tested some automations. Some of these rule based automations. OK, got it. So you're aware of those, and then, you know, we also do have service level agreements. So not sure if you've created any of these, but you can create slas to ensure things don't slip between the cracks. So let's say, you know, an urgent request comes in, it's been tagged urgent. We have a first response goal of 30 minutes and a resolution goal of 24 hours. If we're not able to hit these marks, you can choose who to notify to escalate the issue.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  OK.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So like another safety net to ensure things that things don't slip between the cracks and if they do the right people are being notified on the conversation.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  OK. I did have a question about the personal inbox. So because… most of these emails are coming to us through like distribution groups even for some of the shared inboxes I've set up in hiver, those emails are still showing up in the personal box as well. Though. Is there any way to filter those out?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that would be a good question, for our technical support team and I think it might be on the outlook side, right? Because you would want, yeah, yeah, because you wouldn't want the, once they're coming into hiver, you won't need to distribute them to people's personal emails and outlook. So that would definitely be a question for the support team and you can contact them, Courtney in the bottom left at any time by hitting instant chat support.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  OK.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then you hit chat with us and then you can have a conversation with them and they'll also hop in a call if need be.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  OK.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But is there anything else? And then in terms of pricing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I would recommend either the pro or the growth plan, the difference is you get up to three share mailboxes or distribution lists with the growth, you get five with the pro, you get 20 automations with the pro, and you get 15 with the growth. And then you just get some additional stuff as well.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  OK. All right. Yeah. I don't think I have any more questions right now. With the extension of the trial, we'll just continue to kind of play with it and see how we can get it to work for our own workflow.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Would same time next week work for you, Courtney to touch base to see how the trial is going and talk about potential next steps?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Yeah, we can do that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And that's the same time works for you on the eighteenth?

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  OK, perfect. So, yeah, feel free to reach out to me or my technical support team as you continue to test. Courtney definitely want to be a resource. I'll send you some additional helpful information as you get up and running as well. But I'm looking forward to hearing about the trial progress and it's running until the end of the 20 second.

Courtney Mendenhall (courtney.mendenhall@airseapackingus.com):
  OK. Sounds good. Thank you very much.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Thank you, Courtney. I'll talk to you soon. All right. Bye.
