Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  hello?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, Lee, B, this is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Give me one second. I'm waiting to join.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  What's up, Matthew?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, how's it going? Is it Dan? Yeah.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  It's Dan.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, Dan, I'm doing good. How you doing?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Good man. Good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. And then we also got Leiby here. Am I saying the name, right? Leiby?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  No, it's Leiby.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Leiby. Perfect. Well, appreciate you both joining here. We waiting on anybody else who?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Is it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. Well, perfect. I'm glad that you guys reached back out. So, yeah, just wanted to spend the first couple minutes just getting an update on what you're looking for here, just to make sure we're aligned here. And then from there, I can help you get set up if that's all right. Yeah, good. Yeah, Dan, did you do the trial last time or we didn't do the trial yet?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  No, we didn't that's the point of this, right? It's like just quick overview, right? Like Leiby is going to help with the implementation, right? So, it's a quick overview of what the ticket in process looks like. And then it's going to be setting up the trial, so we can figure out how we're going to help roll this out.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Sounds good. And then how many people did you have again, that would be using this potentially?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Not sure, right? Like it depends how we're going to roll it out… but like that, you know, once we figure out the pricing we'll determine how many folks would be doing this?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. And you're using Google suite, right?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Yeah, we're G suite. That's why we looked into this.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Perfect. So, yeah, I'll just walk through some high level of what hiver is for Leiby here, and then we'll take it from there. Does that sound good?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Let's do it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. Can you see my screen?

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, let me know if you have any questions through it. But basically hiver, we're a certified Google partner. You simply download the hiver extension. Once you download the extension, you're going to have these yellow icons in the upper, right here, and then these yellow icons down here. And how that works is you're going to have your personal emails. You're going to be working your personal emails just like normal. They're not connected to hiver. And then down here in the yellow, you're going to have easy access to the shared email inbox that you have.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yep.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  So, I need to assign it to which inbox it goes to?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Did you have any emails in mind that you wanted to use hiver for?

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Yeah, for the salespeople?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Yeah, it'll be shipping, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, the shipping email, we connect it to a folder here. You can add the salespeople to that folder. Then they everyone, they would all have access to it now… right? So you attach the email there. And then whenever somebody emails that shipping email, it's going to land in the shipping folder that I help you set up and it's going to land in the unassigned folder here. So all the emails coming in, they start as unassigned.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And now when you open an email in hiver, you're going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you're going to be able to go ahead and assign it to each other, right? So email comes into the shipping email. You can then go ahead and assign to somebody on your team. That person is now responsible for that email. They're going to get notified up here with the bell icon, and that everyone's going to have their own mind folder here. This is where all the emails they get assigned are going to land. Now, there's statuses for the emails open pending closed. So you always know the status of them. There's tags for these emails, right? So, you know what type of email this is, right? If this is a new order, you can tag it as a new order. These are customizable. We have custom fields here. These are also customizable. Anything custom that you're looking to track along with these emails… down here is the communication piece. This is where you can put notes. You hit the at mention button. Everyone's name in the account pops up and it's like, hey, Cole, can you help on this? And then Cole would get notified up here that I've mentioned him to help on this email. So you can go back and forwards. This is only within hiver. The person emailing in is not going to see it and you can assign this to each other.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'll pause there. Any questions about that?

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Not yet. Okay. Basically. Okay. But this only works if shipping is a inbox, but so, okay, because at the moment, shipping is a group. So someone's going to have to, if it's a group email, who's going to assign it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So actually a group would be completely fine.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  How is it going to work? If it's a group?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So,

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  somebody like kind of owns it, you know, to assign it to other people like that's kind of like what Abe would do for now. You know what I mean?

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Yeah. So like.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  How it would work is, right? We'd have a folder here. We'd call it shipping, right? It's going to be tied to that shipping group email that you have. And then within hiver, we add people to it. So, like, for instance, this ship, let's just say this was shipping, it's shipping at, you know, whatever your domain is. And then I'd give the different people and then all these people would have access to it. So, matt, Yukta, minaj, Cole, all these people have access to the shipping group email, and we'll be able to see it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, basically.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Okay. So this is all in Gmail?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, this is all within Gmail exactly. So, so the kind of the point of having, hiver is that, you know, is that it gives your team members access to that shipping email without them having to log into it. That's kind of the whole point of using hiver. We just, we.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  shipping email is not an inbox. It's a, it's an email group. It's not an actual inbox.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's no problem. It's a group, no problem. We, so we do Gmail accounts, and we can also do groups. And, I mean, our, people are emailing into that shipping email, right?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, yep, no problem. We connect that group to hiver, and then we share that group with other people. And now everyone can see, the emails going to that shipping group, without having to log into that shipping, without having to do anything with that shipping, right? It's all within hiver and it takes care of all that for you. And I'll show you here the benefit of that. Is that now, with that shipping group, you have, you're also going to have this team view in hiver which will allow you to see all the open, all the open emails across that address and who's working on them, right? So, we have open emails here. I can see Cole has five. I have three, I can click on anyone's emails. I can see all the back and forwards. I can see all the notes when the email came in, any changes that were made to the email, I can respond to the email if I have to, right? So you get complete visibility into how all these emails are being handled and all your team members as well. Once I.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Assign it, I see, who it's assigned, then I, once they finish, I can see that it's done.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yes. Yep. So once they, once they're done with this, they just have to simply move.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  It to closed. And then it's going to be that. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. And then it will say down here, this, I changed the status to closed and… it's done. And there's a separate folder for closed. There's a folder called closed. And this is where all the closed emails go. So you'll still be able to see them.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But basically, you know, why a lot of people come to hiver and sign up for hiver is because they say, hey, we have this email or this group where we're getting a lot of emails to, and we need a better way to manage those emails to assign those emails to team members and make sure that none of them are falling through the cracks. So that's a big reason why people sign up and use hiver. Yeah, is to connect those groups to hiver, so that you can assign them to each other. And we could do this for other groups that you have other emails that you have. I don't know if you have some other ones, but like, you know, operations, sales, legal, accounting, emails, any group emails, group or groups that you have can all be managed within hiver.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But yeah, I'll pause there.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Go through the, go through the reporting to verify that everything has been addressed or that all tickets have been answered.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. So we have reporting. You can select on the mailbox that you want to see.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You can select the timeframe could be custom, could be last 90 days and you're going to see in the last, whatever date frame you said. Okay, we got this many emails in the last 90 days. We've only resolved 39 emails in the last 90 days. It also tracks the average response times, resolution times. You're going to be able to see the workload across the team. So, like in the past month, how many emails did we assign to each team member? It's also going to track each person's response times their resolution times, how fast are they addressing these emails? You're also with those tags, we're going to be able to track, okay, what types of emails are we getting? So in the past month, we got, you know, four emails about escalations, or in the past month, we got 25 emails about billing issues, et cetera.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Who applies the tags?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You apply them, anyone can apply the tags, but also, we have automations where they can actually be applied automatically. And we can do that based on keywords as… well. So like for instance, if you got an email and it mentions the word invoice in the email, we can have it so that it automatically applies the billing tag. So any email that comes into that group where the word invoice is mentioned in the email, it will automatically apply the billing tag.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Are you able to take that automation for others? Like if you tag it based on, you know, invoice or finance, whatever does it automatically, then tag specific people correlated to that tag?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we could, you could absolutely do that. Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So that's another big part of hiver is using those automations.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There's a lot of different options here. But yeah, when a new conversation is received, it's how it works is like if this happens, then we want the following actions. So if an email is received and in the body of the email, it mentions the word invoice, taxes. If it mentions those words, then the action is we want it to automatically get assigned to call and then we want it to automatically add… the new vendor tag and I'll be summarized here. So when an email is received in the operations inbox, if the email contains either invoice or taxes, the system assigns the email to call and adds the tag new vendor and you just hit save and it's good to go.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Show me the screen. Again. This shows completion of, I guess I'll attach for the day, cause essentially like for us what we're looking for. It's like it's multiple reasons, but the primary one is to make sure that all emails within the shipping inbox are being responded to and resolved. Yeah. How do we accomplish that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So the best way for that is to use the team view. So this team view here shows you all the open emails that need to be resolved for that shipping email.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  How do you close it? Like, so, you know, somebody gets Jake has his email, you know, he replies and he says this is done. What does he do?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So he can do a couple of things. So Jake can either just move it to the closed status and you'll notice when I moved this. So we have 23 emails in here, right? 23 open emails that need to get, need to get taken care of today. I can move it to the closed status here. You're going to notice this is going to go down to 22. So nothing, as soon as you move it to closed, it's no longer going to be in this view. And another way you can do that is let's say Jake just responds to this and wants to close it. He can also hit this send and close button so he can respond to this email and then hit send and close and it will automatically close this as well. But this, yeah.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  What's what's the reporting, way, of seeing like a completion of total emails like this? So you're doing this based on this view, but like, is there something on the analytics section of this, that shows the same?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. There's something similar. This, this view, is better. This is the view that, are, that I would recommend using because it just gives you a real quick snapshot into it. You can easily see in this view as well. The people that are working on it, right there's. 22 emails in here. Cole has four of them on his plate. Jeevan has one, matt has three. So this view gives you a real time. And then also in this view too, I can come in here and I can even communicate with that person and be like, hey, matt, you need to close this out, you need to respond, please respond.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  That's assuming that all those people, have a license. What if they don't have licenses? How does that, how would that flow?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, they would, I mean, for, this view to work, they would need a license.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  So, what if they don't how does this work?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  If they don't then you just, they're just not, you're not going to see it in hiver?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  So, you're not going to be able to assign them anything?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Correct.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Got it. Okay. What, what's the other view to see completion besides that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So yeah, there's from.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  a reporting standpoint, like, is there no report that shows there were 24 emails and 24 were answered for whatever range of time or days?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, there is. So, this is the view for that. You put in the timeframe here could be, this week could be today, right? Let's just do today, see if you got me, it'll show you new conversations and then resolved.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Okay. Because your example doesn't have anything resolved. But, yeah, okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Fine. Exactly.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Where was this? Where was the view that showed like, time to answer email? Does it, does it show that? Like how quickly was the first reply, to an email?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, you can see that at the individual level. So you'll see the, per, each person's average response times, how fast it takes them on average to respond to these emails, and then also average time to close. So, how long does it take them to close these emails?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  What I meant was, like not targeting a user, but like here's, an email, how long did it take to answer like that specific email? Is there a view for that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for a specific email,

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Like if you want it to like deep dive, right? Like here's, an email, I want to see who answered first and how long did it take? You know what I mean?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, like.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  A transaction log of an email, you know what I mean?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So, so basically, when you clicked on resolve conversations here, you just click on this analyze button here and it's going to show you, how long it took to resolve that email?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Yeah, but it looks like, is, that, is that the specific email or is that like cumulative, it says emails from mailbox number two for Tony. What does that mean? See that? Yeah, what does that mean? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I believe that just means like the, what's it called? Like the thread, the amount of back and forth emails on it?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, but, yeah, it'll show the email there. When the email was created, and then the, time it took to resolve it.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then the other thing we could do is we could set up slas for these emails. So it could be like, if nobody responds to this email within two hours, then it will notify you that it's late. So, basically, you can see these two emails here. They have these red lightning bolts. These are because these have crossed that threshold and they're late.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Is there reporting around that too to figure out how many crossed the threshold?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. Yep. So, there's a view and a reporting for that. So, the red lightning bolts here will let you know that they're late. There's also a view called overdue which will just quickly show you the emails that are late. And then there's reporting for that as well.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So in the reporting, it's SLA reporting… and let me choose a different inbox here. Somebody renamed them. I don't know why.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, and it will show you okay, how many emails today or this month or whatever you want to see were late, right? So there were eight emails that were late. I can see what the emails were… right? When they were violated at, when the email was created, what the SLA policy that was violated, I can easily group them and see, you know, who violated these slas, right? So you, they violated it three times here, Cole, violated one et cetera. And then you can also see things such as like compliance. So like the amount of times that people didn't… violate them.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Got it. Yep. What's custom reporting? What is that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. So custom reporting allows you to just build any types of custom reports, anything that you're looking to track. So it could be anything custom, like new conversations that are, you know, this could be a report based on a certain person, right? So all I want to see all calls new conversations that are associated with accounts receivable, right? So anything custom that you're looking to see, you can just build a custom report and save it so that you can have easy access to it.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Okay. Sentiment.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Kid, Dane, go ahead.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  What's sentiment?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes, sentiment is an AI feature. So, we have an AI add on. It includes all of our AI features. Sentiment lets you know the sentiment of the email. So let me show you in this view a little better.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Or is that just like tone?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So this just lets you know the tone of these emails coming in, right? So these are the open emails we have here are the different tones of it. This one's neutral. This one's negative that's.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  so nice. It'll just.

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  Be fucking pissed off face.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Exactly.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, you know, we got, you got a lot, we got tech. You text a lot of tech support teams that use it and, you know, it's not as they like that kind of stuff. And then, the other AI features that we have, these weren't around. I don't think these, this wasn't around when the last time we spoke… first of all, when you respond to these emails, you can also use templates. So these templates can be shared with everybody on the team. Just go to those kind of like repeatable emails that you get. We have an AI chat, gpt feature here where you can just like fix the grammar, make it more empathetic, but this is really one of the biggest AI features that we have that people sign up for is it can actually draft replies for you. So it learns from the emails that you're getting it'll. Ask you a three prompt clarified question. You choose the prompt that you want… and it will actually draft replies for you.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  One more question I have this view is every user has this view, correct? What if I don't want the user to be able to see what we assign to other people?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, unfortunately, they would be able to see that with hiver.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  And they'll be able to see the analytics as well to see who's doing a good job, who's not, no.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  They won't see the analytics or anything like that. We have different permission levels you can set. But the one thing that they would be able to see is they would be able to see this team view here, which would show who's working on what… but they won't see the analytics if you want to hide the analytics from certain people, you absolutely can do that. We have different permission levels for that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So you'll see there's different roles, admin supervisor member, and they won't have access to that.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  So, technically, the only way to test hiver is with multiple users. One user alone can't really test it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Correct. Yeah, it'd be best for multiple users.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Dan, any other questions?

World Wide Plumbing Supply:
  No, I'm good.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  OK. Quick question. Now, the 1,000,000 dollar question, what's the cost per user?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, it's on our website, we have different packages here. Growth and pro, I think would probably be best for you. We do sell in buckets of five now… and growth is capped at 10 users. So if you have under 10 users, you can look at growth. If you have over 10 users, you have to do at least pro is more expensive because it has added features on it. All the added features that it has are listed down here. Some of the ones that we went over today are the SLA reporting. So, the reporting that shows, you know, the violations, the compliance, customer satisfaction surveys, if you wanted to use those that's another pro feature here, setting up custom dashboards is a pro feature as well.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Can I buy different level licenses? I mean to say for someone that is going to be an admin, I'll pay the 45 dollars. But for someone that is going to be just a user that we need to use to attach emails to him, ticketing, I could just buy the free user or the growth user.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, no, that's not how it works. It is across the entire account.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Okay. And I cannot have more than 10 of the growth users.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Correct.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, really? Yeah, really? What I would recommend is, right, we set up a trial, you test it out. And then during the trial, it'll help us figure out, you know, which features if you needed any of the pro features or if you're fine with just growth. So during the trial, you know, we can test these things out and you can make a decision after that.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  How long is the trial? And how many users can I test it out in the trial?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, the trial is a week long, seven days and you can add as many people as you want.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Okay. So we'll definitely want to do a trial, but I want to discuss with Dan if we should start the seven days today? Or we should see when is the best time that we can actually maximize in seven days to really see if it makes financially sense for us to spend the 50 to 45 dollars a user for 10, 20 people.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, it's up to you. You can let me know and what we can do is we can get another call like this and I'll help you with setting it up the trial so that you can get the best use of it. And then also me and an additional person on my team is just going to be to help out as well with your trial. Just make sure that you guys are using it, that if you have any questions, anything like that. And then, yeah, we could be a little bit flexible with the trial, right? Like if you needed say you needed some, a little bit extra time like, you know, an extra four days or something like that. That's no problem.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  So it looks very good. It looks very promising but we definitely want to do a free trial beforehand. So I would just say let's leave it like this. Give me, give me a day or two. Let's discuss with Dan when's the best time to start the free trial, and we'll get back to you once we do the free trial, then we can discuss actually how many licenses we want and how we want to set it up.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. That works for me.

Leiby Brachfeld (leiby@wwps.co):
  Dan. All good. Yeah, we're good. Thank.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  you. All right. Thank you both talk soon, bye.
