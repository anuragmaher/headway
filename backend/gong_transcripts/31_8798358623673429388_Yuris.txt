Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  that's it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  For.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  big red.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So, email coming in at three P. M on top once that email there's, a link in it, once you click the email and they accept the invite, then it generates a second email with that particular PDF that came in at 315, if you can see that, right?

Abraham Smythe:
  Now,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  what's happening? Abraham, is this is in the source mailbox?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. Is that?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. Yeah.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  This is.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  The main shared inbox?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Now, this is an email that we're switching from to this one right here, where we have the hyphen?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Got it. But is this the email account that you were showing me earlier? The other tab, is that the main loads at tfexpressdispatch? Com. Email?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. So, yeah, let me go back. I connect the inbox. I'm forwarding every email that's coming to tfexpress. Com to the inbox of loads at, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's the thing, right? So, can you show me the previous tab that you were showing me where the conversation was together?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. This one. So, this is the loads at mailbox.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, this is the main inbox. So, yeah. So Abraham, so in the main inbox, if you can tell these emails are all coming in together.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. But when they come, when it comes into hiver, it's getting split the tabs, the thread is getting split.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. When it comes to, hiver, is split and two email changes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We're splitting it.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah, here is the original email. And then after that, when the other email came, it split completely?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  came as another email change except for the PDF.

Abraham Smythe:
  That should be even that source account looks like a different email address actually.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Well, it's the same email thread Abraham.

Abraham Smythe:
  No, no, I'm saying the shade inbox address is different to the one that you.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just was actually showing us, I understand. But it's the same exact email?

Abraham Smythe:
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, how does it work? Yuris? So, does this tfexpress Gmail. Com. Does that forward into loads at tfexpress? Gmail? Com?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yes, exactly. When they came to tfexpress. Gmail. Com, I put a forwarding to the loads at Gmail. And that group?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Is the one that is connected to hiver, correct? Yeah.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  The loads is the one connected to hiver, yes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Abraham Smythe:
  Okay. And the second where the PDF gets generated that's creating a second thread on hiver?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Abraham Smythe:
  Okay. I also noticed that you haven't declared this email address as an alias because it's forwarding it to this, right?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah.

Abraham Smythe:
  Can you go to the shade inbox once, please settings hiver settings in the top… on the top right of your screen? Yeah, no, the hiver settings, click on the hiver menu just beside the bell icon. Yes, that's the one correct. And then click on admin panel over here. Okay? And click on shade inboxes. Now, can you open up the loads inbox over here? Click on it on the left tab. You see an option called alias is just under autoresponder. And, yes, a little below that, below automations, you see AI automations, autoresponder, and then aliases, can you click on aliases just below that, just below autoresponder? Yes. Can you put in the alias email address over here? The Gmail account?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  What email account, the one that's being forwarded?

Abraham Smythe:
  To, yes, the one that the emails are being actually sent to?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay.

Abraham Smythe:
  So, this is the shade inbox address, correct? Which you're putting in right now?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. The loads is the shared inbox, that is the group that we're creating, the email. Yeah. And then we have myself, okay. Three more people with the same under the loads at TF express dispatch email and then got.

Abraham Smythe:
  It.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  a lot of brokers keep using this email. I forward the impacts from this email to loads at TF express? No?

Abraham Smythe:
  No. The one that the emails are being sent to the one where few of your customers are still sending emails to, right? Can you put in that email address over here? Yes, this one, correct? Okay. Click on add. Okay, thank you. You can go back to your Gmail page now. Is there a way that we can trigger this email once again, just for testing purposes? I mean, the one where on the same thread, you create the PDF, right?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah, that would be impossible to do it to recreate because the broker will not do it.

Abraham Smythe:
  Okay. Understood. So, what we've ideally done is let me explain what was happening and what we've changed right now. So as of now, your customers, your brokers would be sending it to the Gmail address, correct? And then those were being forwarded to the shared inbox address, the TFT address which you've created, right?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. Like right here?

Abraham Smythe:
  Yes, it will be probably a filter.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. Whatever email is coming to this address is being forwarded to this email group, correct? That's.

Abraham Smythe:
  the shared inbox address?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah, that we have three other guys, correct? So.

Abraham Smythe:
  As of now, hiver still doesn't understand that. I mean, prior to you've, added that email address as an alias, hiver never actually understood that these emails were being forwarded to the shared inbox address. If that makes sense? I'm not sure if I'm confusing you, but, yeah.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. Can you say that again?

Abraham Smythe:
  Yes. What I was trying to explain is before you've added the alias or declared the alias right now, what steps you've taken and you've added the Gmail address under the shared inbox, right? By doing that step, you're making hiver understand that emails sent to the Gmail address are being forwarded to the shared inbox. So, if you are asking hiver to recognize those emails that are being sent to the shared inbox. Okay? Now, yes. Now, going forward. So, these emails should actually come in the same thread because hiver will understand that that's been declared as an alias, right in the shared inbox. Yeah… if there's a way that we can test it out right now, that would be great. But nevertheless, we, I mean, the support team is always available. If you run into any issues or this issue crops up again, can you click on the hiver menu button? The one that you've just clicked on the top, right? Yes. Over here. Do you see instant chat? The second last option? Yes, you can initiate a chat from here and we are available around the clock. So we'd be more than happy to, you know, investigate this or troubleshoot this further.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. I'll see if that changed the issue. And then I'm going to upgrade before it expires?

Abraham Smythe:
  Correct. Yes. All right.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  There's only three of us.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, so, yeah. You'll see there on the left, yours, it's in buckets. Yeah. Okay. And then actually, before you go ahead and purchase here, I was just looking at your account just cause this is something that comes a lot up a lot. We got one, two, three, four, five, six. You have six people in there. So that.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  they're not sharing the inbox.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Well, let's go ahead and fix that before you purchase here. Okay?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Where should I go?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Click on, users and roles… on the left, towards the bottom, right above settings. Yeah. Okay, perfect. So, yeah, you see how you have these people in there? Yeah.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. So, yeah, that one doesn't need to be there.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, hit that pencil button next to him. Actually, sorry, I click on the, check mark next to their name on the left. And then, delete user… which is in the left, on the bar, right here in the middle of the screen, kinda… you see where it says selected to selected on the middle of the middle screen. Yeah, there's the user. Perfect.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You can just skip this part.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then, so, yeah, so, basically, as you saw on that screen, it's in buckets, right? So you can buy two users or you can buy five users or 10 users. So, it goes in buckets after that. So, it's kind of based on how many people you want in the account.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But, yeah, you don't we don't have, you don't have to purchase with us, on the screen here too. We can jump here, but just, did you have any other questions or are you good enough to go sign up?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. How smart is the AI to distinguish stuff?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's very good. What do you mean by, distinguish?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  I don't know. I'm still trying it out because, I see when you put labels, and we do something specifically, it put the label on because I told the AI what, what, they, label is for, but like, we have a TMS as you can see here, we have this TMS and then from the email, we have been sending the, these things from here, I don't know why it's not showing me hiver now.

Abraham Smythe:
  Yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I think this is just, this browser is probably open before you reinstalled it again. Yeah, just go refresh it.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  What?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah, it's not there.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  yeah, maybe just go back to Gmail.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, let's just use this browser. Let me.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Find an example to see.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  So, we send this.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  I don't think if the AI will recognize, but, well, it's better to ask. And then once I confirm the confirmations and send, I… send it to my, TMS system. Yeah. And then we have, I create this, tag says data track upload that is being, uploaded to my TMS system, but I've been doing it. I've been doing a manual. It hasn't recognized the action. When I do it. I told him, what this label was for, but I don't think the AI hasn't recognized it. So, I just want to verify how smart it is for this kind of stuff. So, I don't waste my time on it. Oh, giving myself headache.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, Jeevan, just correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the AI would be able to recognize that as far as like an action on an attachment.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We'd have to check. I think it should be able to read the attachment as well. But I mean, that's something that we'd have to check, but, yeah, you can train the AI in the AI button. We can help you do it as well. You, we can check whether it'll cover the attachment. I think it does, but I'll have to confirm, but you can train the AI in the admin. In the admin panel, there is an AI section. You can train it there and say this is where we want. This is the kind of emails that we wanted to, tag. And then from that point on, it will be able to go ahead and pick up and tag those emails.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. How do you train the AI?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just click on hiver settings. Yeah… click on admin panel… click on shared inboxes… click on loads, click on the AI button in the middle there. Yeah, AI tagging, and then you can configure AI tagging.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Is it AI copilot? Wait, I'm sorry.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No tagging. Yes, tagging, and then you can hit configure there.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Oh, tagging. Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And then here is how you can, choose the tags that you want to use. You can click add tag, and then you can select that from, data truck upload. And then you can, you want to say, what the AI, needs to do. And, so now you can go to manage tags.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Manage tags.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right there. Yeah. And then you can go in and you can edit it and you can train, you can choose the learning data, and then, you, once you're happy with it, you can edit it and you can enable it.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. Let me, let me try one thing and see if it does it.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yes, it does. You don't have the processing?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  I think that one's being uploaded already?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  It's not… showing me the title side. When I log in, when I click the email, it keeps showing it. So I don't understand why… it doesn't show the tag outside the email?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Hello?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, it should.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  You say there has to be tech on it. If you see it doesn't have it…

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Interesting. I'm not really sure why the tag's not showing up there.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Where, exactly?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Look, when you click it shows the tag.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. Yes, you.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  See it. And then I'm going to put my label on, just to make sure I'm, clicking the right one. It's not showing any of the label at all.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just, just give it a second. Since you've just created the tag, can you just hit refresh here? And it seems like you've got multiple different versions of the same, email address. So that sometimes will cause it to do so. If you just hit the, just refresh the whole screen?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  They haven't disappeared… that's why it wasn't.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  give it a second. Just give it a second to catch up.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  So, you're going to see it's not an extension.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hiver hasn't even loaded here. Do you have any other tab that is open with the same account? Your email address?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah, this is the email address. For some reason, it's been disappearing.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just, hit refresh for me because I don't even see the extension on,

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Let me let,

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  me, put the extension here because for some reason, it's not showing.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. When I refresh the whole thing, it disappeared because when I was trying to, I think I eliminated, I was trying to make sure that everything was working to try to reinstall it. And, yes, when I refresh the website, it's gone, let me put it again. So hiver?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Hybride, extension.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. What should I say? I'm sorry?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'm sorry, one second. No, yeah. So, it was, I was under the impression that the extension was installed. Was that a different profile?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  No, it's the same one. It's the same one. It's being installed in this one.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  It's not there.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  What is it called in the extension?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  The hiver extension, hiver Chrome extension?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we put it in the, the chat as well down there in the zoom chat.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we think it might be because you have multiple, do you have this email open in multiple tabs?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  I will do this. I'll close everything.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Say, say, no.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  I already closed all the Google Chrome's.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  yeah. So, I don't know that one. Yep. And, yeah, go to your Gmail. On this one. I wonder if it'll if it's there?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Let's see. Yeah.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah, I think, it's been deleted?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, let's just go download it again. Yeah, just, type in hiver Chrome extension?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, click on the top one. It's Chrome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. And then, yeah, we want, you want to see if that folder was showing up. Okay. Yeah. So, it looks like, that tag is showing up now, right?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. Let me make sure that when we do… the option of uploading the notes, I want to make sure. I… guess it is.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. I guess, let… me see if I can send myself a new load in one second. Let me see if it recognize what I want them to do.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  These two.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah, it's not recognizing the action of clicking here and sending it. I guess I have to do it manually.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  No.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah, it's not recognizing it, the action of sending through the email to the TMS?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Was that really? The only, way you envisioned using the, AI tagging?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah. Something like that and let's see how it's more positive. I'm.

Abraham Smythe:
  so, sorry to interrupt. I'm so, sorry to interrupt, matt, I don't think, the AI tagging is toggled on for them. Juris, can you go back to the admin panel, please hiver admin panel… go to shared inboxes, click on shared inboxes, select the shared inbox… and then click on AI.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  On the left.

Abraham Smythe:
  Okay. And then configure the right of AI tagging? No, no, not AI co, pilot configure. Yeah, do you see AI tagging toggle on this, AI tagging on the right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Abraham Smythe:
  Click on enable now… yeah, now, you should try it out.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let's try it out now and just make sure you, let's just use the same, go back to the same browser. Yeah, and then just, exit from here, you hit that. Yeah, there we go.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  You want me to refresh the whole website? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Sure. Just hit refresh here real quick, sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So now we have the AI tagging enabled here. So let's try one more time here.

Abraham Smythe:
  But just to give you a heads up, uris, it generally takes AI tagging, I mean, it learns the patterns based on the last 10 emails. So, once you start training it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You'll have to train the data, right? Uris, correct? You'll have to go into the admin panel and choose 10 emails that fall under this tag that you want that you would like to have been tagged. And those are example emails that our AI that our AI learns from. And then from there, you can go in and it'll start tagging it after that.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. Let me take another one. I don't want to repeat the same load in the same system. Sorry, I'm.

Abraham Smythe:
  I'm.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  not sure whether it's everyone, but I'm having a tough time hearing you, uris.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  I say, I'm about to forward myself another load that we haven't uploaded to the system yet.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah, it would be nice when my, when I create the tabs and when we do the actions repeatedly, and I know my people can't forget to put their labels.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  It just would be nice if they forget that the AI would do it by itself.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you're so, so that's the thing, right? We got it's. The AI's gotta have a, gotta have 10 emails, to use to learn from.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  For, for it to start working. So, it's not gonna, it's not gonna start working right away until it has those 10 emails.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. We do. I'll start sending more loads and training the AI. I'm gonna play right now, for the service. Okay? Hopefully, between today and tomorrow and Monday, AI can get trained.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, actually, so, so actually, this, I, I went ahead and extended your trial an extra day. So, you have today, and tomorrow to test it out because, you wanna just let me know. Do you wanna let you wanna let me know? Let me know if you want, to purchase the AI or not? Because it's a separate it's a separate thing.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Oh, so that AI is not included in that packet?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Correct. No, AI is a separate add on.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Oh, I see.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Otherwise, you can just go ahead and otherwise you can just go ahead and purchase. But yeah, the AI is a separate add on.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Which is.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, these are the different, these are the different packages, right? Growth pro, and elite elite's for big companies, you don't have to worry about that. And basically, it's sold. And if you look at the top left there, it's in buckets of two users, five users, 10 users, right? And then the difference between growth and pro, are those added features that are listed under pro?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. So the pro has the AI?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No. So, the AI is a different, I'd have to, I'll send you a quote for the AI, if you actually go to our website, so, yeah, it's a little bit confusing, not going to lie to you, but just go to our pricing website, hiver pricing.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, you'll see the different packages like you see here. And then if you scroll down a bit, you're going to see there's the AI. So how it works is you get access to all the AI features and it's an additional 20 dollars per person per month.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. So inside, if I get the package of this one plus another 20?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Dollars, if you were to get, exactly. So if you were to get growth instead of it being 25 dollars a user a month, it's going to be 45 dollars a user a month, and it's going to give you AI.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Okay. I see. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to start training the AI and see if it does it, the actions are putting the labels by itself and if it really do, I probably will proceed with the AI… system.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Yep. Just let me buy them. If you want the AI, I can send you a quote, and then if not, you can just purchase directly here in your account, okay?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  That's good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, then absolutely. And then as we showed you earlier, feel free to reach out to support in the upper right hand corner if you have any more technical issues, but I'm hoping that things should be fairly smooth, right?

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Fantastic. Well, appreciate it. Yuris, let me know if you need anything.

Yuris Martin (yurisceo@tfexpressdispatch.com):
  All right. Thank you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks bye.
