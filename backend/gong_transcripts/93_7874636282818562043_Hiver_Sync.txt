Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Christine.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Hi, how's it going?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good. How are you?

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  I'm good. I'm a little tired, but today's October so long?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Weekend?

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Yeah. Well, kind of we're dog sitting. So it actually was a lot of time at home but we have a dog too. So it's just been like a puppy party.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, yeah. A double doozy.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Feeding them is like chaos because they all eat at such different paces and are all trying to like eat each other's food. It's fine. It's also funny because we have veterans day off tomorrow, so it's like we had the weekend and then work today and then don't have to work tomorrow. So it feels like a fake work day.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I know. Yeah, we have off tomorrow too. Yeah.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  It's so funny. I'm like, I get it, but I'm like I wish we could have just like observed it on Monday.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's like we could have shifted it back one day.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Yeah, exactly. I don't know. I feel like we do that for other holidays, yeah… but it is what it is. How was your weekend? It?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Was good. It was good. I just hung out in Brooklyn, went to the botanical garden. The park. It was a, very Brooklyn weekend.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Yeah, that sounds so nice. Is it starting to get cold over there yet?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's pretty chilly out today. It's like 50.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that is a little cold.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's like windy but the trees are turning now, so it's a good time for the city.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Oh, yeah. It probably is so pretty. I have a couple of phones that just moved to New York and I want to visit them, but I'm debating if I want to wait till like spring summer or like just make it a trip and get used to the cold out there.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you should either like do it around like Christmas time, if possible or spring, I think.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Yeah, that's kind of what I'm leaning towards that'll probably be spring or something, but, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Spring's a great time. It's great weather. The flowers and stuff are pretty.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Yeah, especially because it's like it's cold in Denver too. So I'm like, well, I don't really want to leave somewhere cold to go to somewhere cold. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  At least you have the mountains there and you can actually enjoy the cold.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Yeah, exactly. We're going to try. I just got my ski pass. So, oh,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  nice. Let's go. Yeah.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Mountains are like already open, which is also crazy.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I know I got to try to make it out there this winter.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Yeah, that's tough. I mean, I feel like it's harder over there too.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's like the good mountains are like still four hours drive. So it's like there's just not much around here. Yeah.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  It's like a full weekend commitment.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Yeah, definitely. Well, cool. I don't feel like I don't have a ton for you.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  I have like a couple things I wrote down. Let me just click into what I wrote down here. Just updating you on everything. We are like more than halfway through the procurement process which is great moving faster than it is last time where there's like 13 steps in the process and we've completed nine of them. So we are almost there. I did also hear from our teams that we might not actually need Alex to review another AI vendor form since we did just have you all review one for the trial. That's still a little bit TBD. I'm waiting on them to confirm that. But if the,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  one that the one that like we haven't gotten signed yet. The, so we don't need to get that signed is what you're saying?

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  I think like, well, did you get sent something… if you were sent something then I think I would sign that, but they were saying they might not need to send over like the AI form but it is still kind of TBD. So if it was sent over to you, I would say to go ahead and sign it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. It was the one that I think you forward me an updated form. I think it was from you, not specifically anyone else.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Oh, yeah. I just sent that to you for review. I thought you were supposed to sign it, but then my security team said they would send that to you all separately?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I still haven't received anything, so maybe just double checking with them to see if that's something we need to do.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Okay. I will ping them right after this and just get like a status check in on that. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Cool.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Okay. Sweet. With all that, like we are making progress, but I think our trial is set to end tomorrow.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  We're also like as we just said out of office tomorrow. Is there any way we're able to extend our trial to like Friday just because everyone's out tomorrow? And then that'll give us like two days?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no problem at all. We'll keep this going as we're kind of wrapping this up here. So I'll just push it out like another 10 days. Oh, perfect as a cushion.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  Okay. That would be amazing. Thank you. And I'll keep like pushing on timing too because we want to get it done as soon as possible.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So should we touch base like same time next week as just like another like potential check in just in case things don't get wrapped up this week?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that would be perfect. And I can email you if they do happen to get wrapped up any earlier. Okay. Cool. So, yeah, I think, yeah, we did get a notification zip on the complete like a couple other things like our payment banking info and stuff like that. So we're doing that now. Okay. Cool. But I think that one AI piece will be good to know if we need to sign anything else. Okay. Perfect. I will check in on that. And then the last thing I wanted to ask you about was if there's anything needed on our side or like if we need to set up more time together when we actually are moving towards like paid services? Like is that going to change anything on our side or is there like a process we need to go through or will we meet with you or will you send us steps like how long? Yeah. So you'll actually get like a dedicated customer success manager. So I'll just introduce you to them and they'll schedule a call for like scoping implementation, workflow and stuff like that. Okay. Cool. Perfect. Well, that works. Yeah, it's been, I mean, well, we've been since August. I think we've been working on this the beginning of August. Yeah, beginning of August. So, I know, I think too, like what happened on our side is when we were researching stuff like then other teams kind of started to be, like, I don't know like so many people got involved and then like people were like trying to figure out like if their team could use it or if they were using something else. And then like our team was like, well, why don't, we just build something, but I'm like it's not the same. It's really not the same. Yeah, you're like please let's not build anything. Let's just buy something. I know.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  I'm like we can layer stuff on if we need to, but let's just do this, please solve so many issues.

Christine Bayliss (christine.bayliss@gusto.com):
  But we're our team's really liking it. So, it's been going, really well but I really appreciate all the time you've spent with us on getting this set up.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, of course. You've been awesome to work with. And if there's anything else I can do in the meantime, just feel free to reach out, but I will, I'll talk to you next week and hope you have a good veterans day. Okay? Sounds good. You too. Thank you. All right. Bye Christine. Bye.
