================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, Ralf. Good morning.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Hey, good morning, Rakesh. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well, thank you, sir. How are you doing?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  I'm good. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely for joining in. I noticed you were at the fire area. We were scheduled to connect in about 10 more minutes, but it's always better to save time for each other. Thank you for again joining in. All right now before we talk business, let me first of all, introduce myself. This is the very first time we're catching up. My name is Rakesh. And I take care of sales at hiver for some bit of us territory as well as the european region. I've been with the company for over four years, have personally onboarded more than 500 teams a lot from, you know, dog training institutions, canine bin, one of those I could still remember that I onboarded back in 20 23. And yeah, we could obviously look at what your major requirements are, what prompted you onto hiver and decide if this is a good solution towards the end of the call.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Very good. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. All right. Now, do you want to tell me what prompted you on hiver? What were you searching for?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Yeah. So the biggest thing is we have a lot of different service offerings and we have just one inbox basically one Gmail account. It's all going to info at wag bone. Com. And then I have mine Ralph at wag. Bone. Com. The info email is being managed by, I would say two different workers of mine are in there replying as well as myself. And as business is getting busier, it's getting too many hands in the cookie jar. We don't know who's taking care of what, and sometimes double answering. And I really need to systemize it. They're also like just forwarding emails to me when it's something that they don't want to answer. So then I get the email, but I really need to now go into their email and reply from there. So it's just like all over the place.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood very clear. Could you also let me know in the info inbox today? How many emails do you receive on an average? Like I'm just trying to visualize how overwhelming it becomes at one point in time?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Not so many. It's not too much, but I think it's going to become more… definitely as we start doing more email marketing. And… I think for right now, what Drew me to hiver is that it's a very, I would imagine more less of a learning curve for the crew to just use Gmail. And, you know, teach them the basics of letting them, you know, marking status tracking and this kind of thing.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, the biggest advantage with hiver is that you're not relying on a solution which is heavy to implement or probably takes weeks or months to go through the learning curve. That's not the case. It is one of those easiest solutions which sit on top of your Gmail inbox, zero learning curve. More of plug and play. And I've literally onboarded teams in no more than 15 minutes. That's how easy the solution would be. And the good part is that even if you've got two workers along with yourself or you may have a couple of more in future, all of us are actually managing info inbox without manually forwarding the emails to each other instead of missing or double replying, we have got the ownership. If I need to pick up an email, raf would get to see, hey, Rakesh is going to be working on this one. You could always pick up the second email. And then there is a complete transparency and visibility across everything that's happening in the info inbox. So that's the idea that everybody login into their individual Gmail accounts and still happen to manage info at the rate email account, for your company, from one Gmail interface?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Very good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Apart from that. So you said you've got two more people yourself third person? Or I mean, are we totally looking at three people inbox management? Or do we have more folks today?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  I think that's really it. They, yeah, the two people I'm talking about, are the, they're… my lead dog handlers and they switch off when they're there. So it's just taking care of, they both have the same set of abilities to take care of the customers at that time. They're the head when they're there. And then there's me, we're a team of about seven people. And soon… I would say soon we're going to have somebody who's dedicated to customer service, front desk and marketing.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Yeah.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Right now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  If I were to ask you,

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  yeah. Two users. I think I'm thinking to just make it work for two years users, see how it goes. If I need to add more to make it clear who's taking care of what we could do that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Definitely. You can always start with two and of course, scale it up. There are there no challenges at all with hiver, let me quickly share my screen and show you what hiver has to offer. And if you come across any more questions, just feel free to ask me. Let me just quickly get it done. Okay? Now, do you see my Gmail inbox? I'm logged into my test account here?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So all two of you guys, like both of you guys would simply log into your individual gmails. We don't need to log in into info at the right inbox that's number one. We need to simply log in into our individual accounts. Hiver running on top of it, this is a little extension. It's a Chrome plugin that needs to be installed on top of our individual Gmail accounts. Once that is done, anything in yellow, sitting right here is hiver sitting in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, the very first thing you would notice is that if there is an email coming into your personal inbox, it goes into your inbox. And these are your private emails, Ralf. So if I send an email to Ralf at the right inbox, email address that's your email. But at the same time, if I send an email, let's say I need to drop my dog for a daycare, and that email goes to your support inbox, which is your info inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You would have an access to the support inbox right here. So basically, that's going to be a shared mailbox, where both of your workers would be actually working from within their personal inboxes. They would see the brand new requests in the unassigned window. Here. Now, when they open the brand new requests, look at the email, they would see what the email is about or need to drop their dog for a daycare. Look at what the context is. And from this activity panel, you would be able to, or they'll be able to assign these conversations to each other. Let's say if I need to work on the email, right? So if I just assign it to myself, I would say this has something to do with the daycare. I can just maybe tag the email manually or I can look at the automation workflows at the backend or imagine if this email was something to do with maybe, you know, any other instance, so I could just go ahead and create more custom fields here. Something like, let me quickly show you the interface on what the custom fields would actually do for you. Basically, it is helping you to it's going to be helping you to triage emails, better organize the data. Better. For an example, let me turn on this type of request. Okay. The same email. And in the mind section, now, I've got these five emails to work on. And if you could see from the team section, how many total requests are there? You will be able to completely see the workload distribution. So Rakesh has got five requests. Yukta is working on one. If Rakesh takes a day off you as a manager can actually look at those emails, pull those emails up and reassign it to somebody else who's available to work on it. So amongst your two folks, you could absolutely manage all of that is happening without forwarding emails to each other. So I go to mind email section. Again, I pick this email up. This is a request for a dog pet care, daycare. What is the request about? Is it a daycare? Pet grooming? So all of these are different services that you offer. And this is how you could actually create these views, the filters and of course, I mean organize your data much better. Secondly, when you want to talk to your colleagues, you don't have to forward emails to each other. Rather your colleague would simply assign ticket to you. So you will be the owner instead of forwarding. I would just assign the ownership and I would just add mention that, hey, Cole, can you work on this one? This is for your information. So that's how you could talk to your colleagues internally without you know, having to have manually forwarding those emails. Once I become the owner of the email and I start to reply, my colleague would immediately get an attention here that, hey Rakesh is already working on it. It would definitely eliminate a chance to have two emails going at the same time. So it will stop, it will eliminate the double responses or, you know, over communicating with the clients. Yeah. Then is the email templates for all the nature of queries which are repetitive in nature? Your team doesn't have to type in so much. Again and again, we can just use all of these templates for standardized responses. So far? Anything to do with the frequently asked questions, we can train hiver AI. It would help your agents to draft a response. It could be like, hey, how much do you charge for daycare? Do you have a bathing service? Can I celebrate my pet's birthday at your campus? All of those are those questions where hiver can help you generate the responses on your colleagues' behalves, and that all will depend upon the knowledge source we insert in hiver. So in hiver, we could say, hey, these are the frequently asked questions and knowledge base. Let's just upload that. And if there is an email coming in hiver, AI can help you generate the responses, drop those responses for you. Cyrus. All right. Is this something in line with what you're looking at today?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Yeah, it is.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. So all the requests that are pending, you could just move into the pending section. Look at the ones which are right there. The red tags are the overdue responses where you haven't been responding to the customers in time. The ones which are closed, you are done with the resolution. These move into the closed bucket. So if there is another response from your client, when you are closing a conversation, it again moves into the mind section or the unassigned section, in case your head dog trainers are unavailable, because probably they are engaged in training, so they can keep themselves away from making sure the new response on their existing email chains will actually go into the unassigned bucket. And from there off, you can actually go ahead and pick these email conversations up.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Any other questions? Any doubts as such? Now, this was a very basic interface. By the way, I mean, we could do a lot of advanced functionalities at the back end wherein you could say, hey, as long as these emails are about day booketing, can I tag those emails automatically? Yes. Can we assign it to a specific trainer? If this is about a specific request, if these are refund, can you just pull it put into a refund bucket? All of that is absolutely possible, along with auto response, which is more like, hey, thank you for contacting. This is your ticket number. These are the working hours. All of that are going to be like traditional ticketing module functionalities. That is by default possible.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Okay. Are you able to see a customer history from, I guess their email?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. As long as an email has the entire chain to it, you will be able to see the entire chain. For an example, I go to the team section and let me see. Okay, now, this email has multiple chains to it. So I could see the entire chain. Now history here is if the same email has been appended by the customer and there are threads to it, I could go through the email chain or I can simply let hiver summarize this email for me. Like maybe if this is a long chain complicated request, I don't have to go through all of that. Hiver literally can take care of all of that for me. And I can save this as a note that's one way to look at it. Another is how many times this customer in the past contacted me and I want to look at the historic data. I can go to the contact bucket here. And this page will tell me there was another, you know, communication from the same customer in the past. So I have an option to look at the history or the historic emails. So two ways to look at it either the same email with the multiple chain threads to it, or altogether a different email which can be found inside the contact bucket.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Okay. And so everything on the right over here where you are now, basically, we get an email. It's going to be unassigned… sign it there after reading, you know, what it is or I can send a lot of the signs.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, absolutely.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  And then we would, I would just go down.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The moment you, assign it to somebody, it would, the emails would start to splash in the mind section for that representative?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Okay. And then setting the, if you go back to the side there, I just want to see. Yeah. So status, once you set it to closed or pending, does, are there like auto emails that the customer gets or nothing happens unless I tell?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It, okay. These are the statuses to triage your emails. This has got nothing to do with sending a response or not. We are actually looking at the response and if this needs an auto response, you can always say, just send a thank you note because we would be working on this email later. So that is an automation workflow by the way. But once you need to work on the email, you could use the templates here. And let's say this customer is asking for a refund because he's not happy with the service provided. So I would say, okay, Rakesh, you joined on January the fourteenth, you're eligible for a 50 percent refund. Now, this could be improvised a little bit more. Let's make it more empathetic. I would say, so I could go ahead and generate these AI responses, right from my within Gmail. And once I'm actually sending this response, then I can go ahead and close it. Meaning I'm just resolving it by processing the refund… in a perfect world. You are still not resolving it. You can actually put this email into pending and use a tag called refund. So as, and when you need to process a refund, you can always go into the pending section and look at the refund requests right there. So this email is about refund. This is about refund and whatever. Whenever I need to process the refund at the back end, I can drop another customer an email. Hey, the refund is done, check in your bank account in about two days and then you close it. So basically, these statuses are to ensure that what is the stage of the customer communication by default, all the communications are going to be in the open because that needs your attention. As and when you are done with the booking, let's say I had an event, I wanted to celebrate a birthday for my pet. The event is over, customer made the payment. We are all happy. We would then close the conversation and what you can still do on top of it is send a quick snippet survey for the customer satisfaction, trying to understand how happy they are with the level of service. So that will be something like you insert a customer satisfaction survey at the bottom of the email. Okay. Let me quickly show you. Yeah. Sorry. Go ahead.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  What's now? I'll let you finish.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I wanted to show you about the customer satisfaction survey. That is more like you're keen to understand how happy your customers are. So that's where you could go ahead and, you know, set this up as and when you automatically close a conversation, so you could set up either happy sad Smiley face or you could just ask, would you like to recommend our services to your friends? Yes. No, maybe you can just do all of that as well.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  You have also to like get Google reviews. Maybe I should just make a template for that or I only want to ask them… if they were happy. I guess I don't want to send it to people who are upset with us, that kind of thing.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. What you can do is then let's say I go into the automations workflow, and as and when I close the ticket, it actually triggers a quick response to the customer with the template to fill a Google review. Let me show you what exactly you could then do as, and when you happen to close a ticket, the status is updated. And what I want to do is if the condition is that we happen to change the status for an email into closed, you then want to actually trigger a condition? Okay. No… I would just simply delete this, but I would want to add a step here action that you want to send a quick notification, send a reply. And this is where you could actually go ahead and say, hey, thanks for your business or however you want to write it, right? I would personally like to understand if you are happy with the, however, right? And then you could insert a quick Google survey form here and again with that, if you, yeah, I mean this happens when you actually close the ticket and this gets a quick email follow up generated that you're not manually doing.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Cool. Okay. Very good. What split conversation I saw on the email?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So that's when yourself is working on a ticket, but you need to forward that to a specific representative in your team. Either you have an option to simply assign them, but let's say this email conversation is with regards to a customer request, but you need to order something from a supplier with this request. So basically, I'm sure, you know, when you actually go ahead and edit the subject line, it splits the conversation, right? I don't want to show the older conversation and it's more like a newer conversation. So basically you're splitting it in a way that you can actually have a new conversation with your new vendor with respect to your customer in communication. So your customer doesn't get to know, but you can always go ahead and say this needs to be worked upon. So basically you're splitting the conversation for future reference.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Got it. Okay. That's not. I don't think that's something I need. Now. What was the other thing? Let me see. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So you would make use of tags when I.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  mention people, yeah, go.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Ahead.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  When I mentioned somebody on my team, where would they see it? Yeah, in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The top bell icon here on the top, they would get to see the notifications. And if you assign them the tickets, they would get to see in the mind section, they would turn on the sound notifications. You could also turn on the email notifications as such. And the same solution works on hiver for mobile. So they can even have the hiver mobile application even if they are on grounds or they are traveling whatever it's absolutely possible to just look at those emails?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Okay. We get requests inside of Instagram messaging. Is that something you guys deal with as well? Or that's not a not at the moment. So it's going to be a different platform?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, it's not the case. It's a very genuine and valid request. We don't have it at the moment. We are working on it by quarter next one year. I mean, by first quarter, next year, it should be out. But at the moment, we can help you sort your info emails, even the chats on your website, even if you want to just make a chat bubble on your website and customers want to just chat with your bot or have those conversations with the open, I mean, online agents or even if you have hiver and whatsapp for business, we can help you manage the whatsapps also. So all of these are going to be just one Omni channel to manage the multiple ways, however not with Instagram at the moment.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Okay. Very good. I think that's really it anything else?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I mean, there are hundreds of things, but I don't want to confuse you. Your use case is very simple. It's very easy. Yeah, I.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  don't want to get confused. I want to just start using it. And then as things arise and I see.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. What?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  My questions are then I'll deal with it then.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Now that's the most intelligent move. I would say, I mean, I always recommend my customers not to look at everything in one go. If we don't have a solution, let's just solve the basic problems, begin with it, train our team. And as and when we grow move faster, you want to look at the reports, then you want to improvise on the category of emails that are absolutely, you know, taking long to respond, then we look at the knowledge based sources, self help portals and everything you are looking at a solution which is actually scalable in future.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Very good. Okay. And in terms of the setup that I need to do to get my team going on it, I think I set up a shared inbox, I can break it down more granular so that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So at the moment you have info inbox, and you?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Anything specific?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Not really. All we need is, yeah. So not really, I would say the only requirement that we have is an access to this info inbox. Like you have info at the rate inbox in your Google workspace. Second is the users should have their individual logins so that we are able to bifurcate the emails and make the ownerships to these emails, right? I'm assuming everybody in your team, like all these people who are going to be working on these emails, have their individual logins. Am I correct in that?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  So, right now, they're just using the info email and they.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  don't have individual logins.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Yeah, I can split them up then I'd be getting three users, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That is correct. And if info has info, yeah, is info at the rate, inbox is a user account for you or is that a Google group?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  It's a user account?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, in hiver, even if it is a group inbox that could still work even if it is an alias or a distribution list without incurring an extra cost on Google license, you can still make it work. You can probably ask Google support to move your user account, which is info at the rate into a group and then create three logins in Google workspace, like however it functions, but we would require individual logins to be there so that everybody log in into their individual gmails, and still manage hiver info inbox right? From their screen setup.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Got it. Okay. All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  What do you think is the next step from here? Do you want me to assist you with the setup and everything?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  I don't think so. If I can try myself and then reach out if I'm stuck, we can do it that way. Yeah, absolutely. But I think I'm pretty good with it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Definitely. Rolf. What I can do is I.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  do all this stuff like that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You don't have to do chat. Jpt, let me send you a quick installation guide. Very easy to set up. Just refer to step by step direction and help yourself, set it up. And should you still come across any question or you need support, we've got world plus best support team which is available. We take pride in it. So, we have got online folks available and I'll still be the point of contact. Feel free to write back to me. What I would love to do is maybe reconnect again on Friday for just about 10 minutes and see the progress. If you require any assistance. If you've got more questions, we can always address all of that for you. How about that?

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Yeah. My router, I know was unplugged and it's getting choppy. So, no.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Worries.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  yeah, Friday, we could reconnect what time?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Perhaps the same time? If that's okay, just for about 15 minutes. Yeah. Okay. I'll call it hiversync. And in the meanwhile, I would assume that you would take out time set up.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Hiver.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sorry, go ahead.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Yeah. Let's do that Friday same time. All right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Let me send you all the information needed to get you started with hiver, the quick installation guide. And should you need any further help, feel free to write back to me Rolf. I'm just an email away from you.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Okay, amazing. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You're very welcome. Thank you so much for your time. Enjoy the rest of your day and we'll reconnect on Friday. I've already sent you an invite by the way.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Thank you, Rakesh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right, great. You, take care, sir. Goodbye.

Ralph Kramer (ralph@wag-bone.com):
  Take care. Bye bye.
