Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Shabri, how are you?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  When users sign the share button?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you hear me?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Hey, sorry, no worries.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  At all. I'm good. Thank you. How are you?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  I'm doing good. Thank you for asking.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. No worries. Shall we get started with the discussion then?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So, Shabri, just a quick introduction from my side. My name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver as well as your point of contact, I'll be helping you with the evaluation. From here. I understand that you spoke with my colleague Hari and gave a brief in terms of what exactly you're looking for. So I'll just try to build on that, understand a bit more in detail and will show you how hiver looks like and how it could potentially work, solve the challenges that you're currently facing with the workflow that you have. So, does that sound good first of all?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So, if I understand this, right? You are an it service company, right? And this is something that you're looking for your it support team which is distributed or managed by about five people. And you guys are sort of using a generic inbox wherein one person sort of monitors all the emails that are coming in and then they notify different individuals. They log in and then they accordingly pick those emails up. Is that the correct process?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Yeah, somewhat similar. But again, it's… not that the dedicated engineer can only look at the emails. Everyone has access to the it to desk mailbox, all of our engineers. And then we have few people. We have only five members working as engineers. After that. We have few people assigned for each customer, say, for example, person a and B is assigned for customer B, customer. One B and C is assigned for customer two, like that, right? So, and,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  all these customers are writing to this generic email address?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  No, we are actually managing their it, and then we manage the mails in such a way that whenever they send the emails to their it help desk, a copy will also get delivered to our it help desk. So that from a centralized location, we can actually view the mail.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So we.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  managed to do the internal forwardings. So each customer have their own it help desk mailbox, whenever there's when whenever somebody sent an email to them, we will also get an email in our generic mailbox so that we also, we all are aware about that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. So basically, you're providing it support or a tech support to your, clients. Basically, that's what your service is for, to. So the companies basically are outsourcing that it support with your company, right?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  That's right? We are providing it support for SMB customers within one of the it park in trivandrum which is called technopark. So, we have few customers around there, and we are slowly expanding, our areas of service outside. So we are also looking for few engagements from abroad and that's where we stand now. And we are, very small and very recently formed. It's only eight months. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So,

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  we only have eight members. As of now. We are a very small lean team.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. So Shabri, help me understand this a little more in terms of, I understood what your offering is. But in terms of your client, so if I am your client, and if my customers are writing to me, let's say as a company, I have a specific email address, let's say tech at the ratehyver. Com. So my customers are writing to tech at the ratehyver. Com with their queries, and whenever they're writing a copy or this email gets forwarded to your team, so then you guys can.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  sense no customers customer. In fact, it's only our customer say, for example, if Iver is one of our customer where we are providing tech support and you are one of the employee in Iver who needs, some kind of requirements on your laptop to work, right? In such scenario, you need to write an email to your, it, help us whatever your domain. Com and we manage that forwarding in such a way that whenever a mail comes to that mailbox, we from atticube side, we will also get a copy on our mailbox so that we also know there is one email which has been raised by Yukta either can be an incident or it can be a request in one of this category. So that in one centralized mailbox, we are getting all the mails from different customers.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many customers do you have in total?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Currently, three customers to be honest on the it support side, but we are also having one more customer on the transformation side. So we are modernizing their info, doing some kind of… revamping their, in their, it. So currently we have four customers and not everyone needs the ticketing solution, but only three needs a ticketing solution. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This requirement or this ask is coming from the customer? No, no.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  The customer is not at all worried, but we need to have some kind of telemetry on how our engineers are performing, how much volume of work we are getting. And for that, we are looking for a cost effective solution which can help us to provide such details. And we are also having a challenge with some of the emails which are getting when the, when there are not many emails which are coming in one one single day, there is a chance that one email out of them might get missed.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  There are chances of course, because then if you have only one single place, all emails are coming there and then everybody is. So all the emails gets forwarded to this common email address or just a few?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  No, all the emails are getting forwarded.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do you have a generic email address with your company address, right? Okay. So let me just share my screen, Shabri, maybe to start with and to get yourself used to this process, you can use high versi, in terms of the cost. I completely understand as you start your business, you would want to look at, you know, in terms of the Roi for each investment that you make for your internal processes or for external, hiver does provide a free plan as well, right? Wherein it allows you to set up one shared mailboxes, you can do all these things in terms of assigning those tickets or emails between yourselves. And then, of course, we have certain paid plans which has these automations, where like you mentioned if an email, if there is a designated person working with a specific client. So any email that comes from that email address and gets forwarded to this shared mailbox should automatically get assigned to them, right? So you can set up those automations as well and can look at those paid plans to begin with. Too. So before we discuss that, let me just show you how the platform looks like. Okay, how it works. So as you can see on my screen, I'm currently logged into this URL, called app, hiverhq. Com. This is where you'll be accessing hiver. So in order to use it, what you need to do is log in using your outlook credentials that you have. Okay, and all the five people, five to eight people, whoever needs to be part of hiver, they all will use their outlook credentials. They will log in here. Once you log in, you will be able to manage your personal inbox as well. So it's not like that only that you are handling the generic inbox that you come here, but you can actually manage your personal inbox as well. And then below this, you see these are the shared mailboxes that I am part of today like finance operations, healthcare support. So likewise, we will be creating one shared mailbox that will be connected with your tech support, email address, at which all these support related emails are getting forwarded. Okay? And we will add all the team members who needs to be part of it, so that we have one generic inbox for everyone's visibility, you do not need to give access to anyone to this account. There is no more confusion, somebody just logging in by themselves and then doing some things or performing some activities or you are forwarding those emails to an individual inbox. And then you don't know what really happened there. So all of those cases will come down as you would have a singular place to manage all these tickets that are coming in, right? So since you mentioned that, you know, all everyone or all the customers that are writing to their company's email address, and that is getting forwarded to your domain. So that's how it will happen. That will not change. You will receive those emails as it is, those are getting forwarded here. So you will see them in the unassigned section. Any email that comes into this inbox, you will see it here. Just tell me one thing like when an email is getting forwarded here, do you get to know this is forwarded from this email address?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  No, it's not forwarded. So if Yukta is sending an email from your domain, when it reaches our destination shared mailbox for tech support in our tenant, we will still see that this email has been sent to Yukta sent by Yukta and sent to ithelpscouthiver. Com, or whatever your domain, okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  we only see that it's actually sent to these two, I mean from, and send us the actual work. We are actually getting BCC in the form that we don't know the actual.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. Okay. So you're getting BCC, so you anyway are getting those emails and it comes and the BCC email address you have, and you said that not everybody is logging into this tech support account, right? So what is happening like people, then you guys forward these emails between yourselves?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  No, we all are having teams accounts. So currently, we are using teams channels as the central point of repository. So whenever an request or an incident comes in, we have a dedicated channel for each customer. We put a message with that email and then stating that there is a new item which needs to be looked at, and whoever is working on, they will actually work on it, and then update on the same thread or as a replay so that we understand how it went off.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So do you then reply also to these emails or you don't do anything?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  We will do the response directly?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You do the response, right? So you will be replying to me, right to Yukta at hypo.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Not me but the engineer, whoever is processing that they will be responding.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Whoever from your team will be replying to me, right? So I will get a reply as a customer not from my company, but I'll get a reply from your side that's right? Okay. So I think that setting will remain as it is. Instead of having to do having to see those emails in that inbox now and then using your teams to then coordinate on these emails who is going to be working on this ticket like that. Then you would have all these members be part of this inbox, so that whenever an email comes in, you can then assign it to whoever needs to work on it. So that every time you don't have to discuss it in the team's channel from here itself, you can give the ownership. Let's say I assign this to myself. This means that it's in my end section. I am going to work on this. Once I've resolved this issue, I can just come here and reply to the customer, right? While replying. Since it's a support use case. I'm sure you would be receiving a lot of repetitive sort of inquiries or queries on a day to day basis. So you could potentially use templates as well. You can create it for everyone's usage. And instead of always, you know, composing your responses, you can just use certain templates to let the other person know that this is resolved. You can also collaborate with your teammates, right? So right now, as you're doing it on team's channel. So here, while the ownership will remain with one person at a time so that we know who is responsible for that ticket, you can still collaborate with your team members here in the notes section. So in case I'm working on this ticket and I need a help from my colleague and I want him to work on this with me. I can just ask him to review this, right? And we both can converse in regards to this particular ticket here, right? So multiple people can be invited and we all can, you know, communicate and any activity that you're performing on email, everything gets recorded as well. So if I'm assigning any conversation to myself, changing the status from open to closed. Since I have now worked on it, everything will be marked here so that we know who is, you know, making what changes on any email?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  And what will happen if the user responds for the user itself, send another email on top of this?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Then it will change to open again automatically. And this will again come into the mind section so that the person can pick it up and.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  what will happen if the user says, thank you for the final email which we are sending as the confirmation, will it reopen it again?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, of course. Yes.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  But why should the ticket get reopened? If the user says, thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But see, as long as you're getting a response in that response, there could be anything, right? What if that person is asking for something in that follow up email, so you would not want to miss that, right?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  And that email will get upended towards the existing email?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, it will be on top. Yeah. But what you can do if you don't want such emails wherein there is a thank you written in the body of the email, and if you want to automatically mark them as closed, you can set up that automation in the backend, but I just feel personally that's redundant because I mean, it's just one off thing that at least, you know, and it's good to see that. Okay person has acknowledged your email and then you come again and then mark it closed and that's it, it's going to go away. Got it, right? So.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  I understand about the functionality. Now, let me ask you. The teams part is also something that you have mentioned on the website, the teams integration can also happen. So, which means no, is it there or no?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no. We don't have teams integrations yet. Okay?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  And you have integration with office for the sixth year, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Like what would you want to use within?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  For accessing the shared mailbox, because I was trying to connect with my office for the sixth year id, of course.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It is connected with your office for the sixth year. So, you will be configuring your email address, creating the shared mailbox on that. And that's how hiver is able to configure all these emails that are coming in… but it's not going to connect with any other apps, if you want to connect it with your outlook calendar or teams channel or teams chat. All of those are not going to be there.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  And the ticket number will be there whenever a ticket is getting generated or an incident or a request, whatever may be the category.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  For the ticket number, like would you want to use it for your own purpose? Or you want to share it with your customers?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  With the customer also, because they want to have some kind of tracking number, so that it is easy for us to trace from our side too.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So for now, we wouldn't have a ticket number since the purpose here is for you to make it much easier and let emails remain as emails. So that when you are responding to any email, you can also use your personal email address if you want. But ticket number is not going to be there for now.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Is it something which is in the roadmap?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We would have it because we do have it. I'm sorry, we have it in our Gmail product wherein you have conversation id associated with each email. So I'm assuming that we would have it here in outlook as well very soon. But currently, we don't support that. Is that mandatory for you?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Yeah. See as we are actually trying to slowly grow, we want to have a reliable system where even though there are hundreds of emails coming in, we need to have the ticket ids or the request number which is going back to the user, so that whenever we communicate back, we have that as the reference number, which will be easy for us emails. The problem is there are many emails which are coming on the same subject line. So, for example, the HR from our customer a, whenever they want to onboard a new employee, they will send an email, new employee onboarding. So that will be the only single line on that subject line which may not be easy for us to identify for which user it was referring to, right? Similarly, HR.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is like from where like from your company or somewhere else?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  From the customer's HR. So in your case, if hiver's HR is sending, there is a new reporting coming for Yukta, and then they are sending an email asking for enable the it related stuff. So we need to get the office of certified id, their laptop, their softwares, all the things. But again, all the new employee onboarding, they will be sending as new employee onboarding the subject line,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, it will be difficult for you to search the conversation. Yeah, yeah, I understand. I mean conversation id could be useful in that case. But then we also have tags here. So with tags, you can actually categorize your emails then of course, if you create a tag which is for HR related queries, or onboarding, you know, assistance or something like that.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  No, that tag will also help because see, it's not about if it is a query related with HR or if it is something with finance it is with, for which user that particular email was triggered for say, for example, today, we have two onboardings. Tomorrow, there will be one another onboarding for a new user. And day after tomorrow, there will be another five onboardings. So there will be multiple onboarding and offboarding emails which will be coming with the subject line, new onboarding request or new offboarding request. So, these emails are actually a little confusing because we may miss one of the email because of the fact that all the emails from our standpoint looks to be the same with the subject and the body. It's only the name which is getting changed. And that is the reason why we were saying we need to have a better tracking where whenever a new email comes in with that subject line, we need to have the ticket id created. And then the response from that point onwards needs to have the id also appended, on the request on the subject line.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So what if you search like by users only, like even if you have a conversation id, you'll be putting this id here and then go to that particular conversation, right?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  If you have access to this environment, you can try to send with two emails with the same, subject line is new user onboarding, one for Shabri, and one for yougta. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You don't have to search it only for subject line even if it's there in the body of the email, but.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  The subject line is the entire subject line is the same, right? New user onboarding. It's the only static element which they are putting because they are using a template on the out from the out, they are using a template. And that template is made in such a way. So there are similar items where we see that we need to have a proper tracking number which can help us to identify if this request was for yougta or if it was for Shabri, or if it was for another user easily by calling that particular reference… id?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah. So in that case, I think then you should be looking at, you know, proper standalone ticketing tool that if you're looking for like all those functionalities of a ticketing solution and have those ticket id associated and then have the ability to track on the basis of tickets that are open, then I think, you know, having a more comprehensive ticketing system might work for you. Yeah.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Anyways, you can explore the options from your backend team. I know that it could be there in the pipeline which can come in the near future.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I can check this internally if it's in near future. I can inform you on the email otherwise, yeah, we could wait. And if you're still exploring at that time, we could reconnect then and then take this.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Yeah. And by the time since, anyway, we are already here, I just want to understand about the licensing plan. So you have a free tire then a premium tire, there are three options available, right? So how is it? We have three growth pro elite based on the functionalities.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That you require, you can make a decision. I think growth should be okay for you because it will give you the analytics part. It will have your slas, and all of that pro will have more advanced functionalities in terms of getting further analytics on the SLA as well that you have set up for the team or having csat business hours and all that. So between these two plans, anything, any plan could work for you?

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  All right. And can we go with a mix and match, maybe only for the growth only for the leads and the managers, and then for the plane engineers who are on the field, the free plan?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no, that's not possible. Everybody will have to be on the same plan.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  All right. So, I got some more insight, but again, I'm still deliberating… on how it can be helpful in our use case. So maybe I will wait for your response on the option to have ticket ids and then I will continue with the evaluation. I will continue with the next steps, whether we need to connect with our shared mailbox, and then see how it's actually working. And then give a try. If… in the real ticketing sense, we will have a look on how it is going to help us.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Sure. Let me do that. Let me connect.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  With the product team and see in terms of the timeline, if it's in the near future, I'll definitely inform you on the email, and then we can resume our.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Evaluation.

SR (sr@atticube.com):
  All right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  All right, Shabri, thank you so much for your time. Take care. Thank you. Thanks, shukta. Bye, bye, bye bye.
