Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  hello? Hello?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Hey, Destiny. How you doing?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Good. How are you?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  I am doing well. It's Friday. Any fun weekend plans?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Cleaning.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  cleaning. Yeah, sometimes it's fun.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah, it'll be a real party over here.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, if it makes you feel better, I'll be packing for a move, which is also not that fun.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Well, are you moving anywhere fun?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Just within still in Denver, but just moving houses… but, yeah, the old, packing up all the stuff. So I'll be busy with that. Hey Misty.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Hello?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Good to see you again. It's been a while.

Misty Warren (mwarren@conservice.com):
  Let's see. I think Michael was able to join. Let me double check. Yeah, he did say he was joining so we can give him another minute.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  A minute or so. I think that's everything from your side, right?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay, Destiny. Do you know?

Misty Warren (mwarren@conservice.com):
  If Michael's still able to join?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  I think he was planning on it. I can chat him right now.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. We're only one minute over. So, Naresh, I just want to make sure we were in fact waiting for him.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  He might not have realized that it got moved up.

Misty Warren (mwarren@conservice.com):
  Oh, yeah. That's right. I think he accepted the new invite though, so.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Is it starting to get cold over there in Utah?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Not as cold as it normally is.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I've heard that across the board. We haven't had snow here yet, which is apparently one of the latest in Denver history. So we'll see… all right while we're waiting for.

Misty Warren (mwarren@conservice.com):
  Michael, I just want.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  to introduce and reintroduce some of the folks on our side, he's been in some calls before, but not always in all of our calls, but just want to make sure everyone was aware. So I have Raghav who's my partner in crime. He partners with all of our accounts together on the account management side, a little bit more the commercial side. But Raghav, I mean, I think you've met with him before, but, you know, if you wanted to add any notes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, no, I think you're good. I've met Destiny and Misty enough times over the last few years that I've been here. I'm just going to, I'm just waiting off because I'm still dealing with a bit of cough and flu, so that's it. I just don't want everybody to see me with a box of tissues, but back to you, Eric, pleasure meeting everybody again.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Well, I hope you feel better, Raghav, and then I also have my colleague Anurag who's from our product side and is really leading the charge on the AI front. So, we just want to include him here to add any additional color if need be, or answer any potential questions you guys might have as we walk through, you know, our AI capabilities. Hey, Michael. Nice to see you.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Hey, sorry, I had to grab something to eat. I got a bunch of meetings, so I had five minutes to bring.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  something together. I know the pain that was me yesterday. No problem. We're just, I was just doing a quick round of intros to some of my colleagues that aren't on every single call. And the purpose of this call. Glad to hear that we finally got in some sign off to start incorporating some of the AI features.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Just wanted a little bit of context, you know, Destiny. I did, you know, I know you mentioned you saw a banner, so to lead off with that, we can disregard that date that we have there that is not accurate for your accounts. I will lead off by saying this is a paid add on. With that being said what our intention has always been for the conservice side and what we've had conversations with your team and both the account managing team is really, we want to trial this until the end of December. We want you to start getting hands on and seeing, you know, the value of this for the teams before we start even having any conversations of potentially adding to this. So what I want to do today is really just walk you through some of the capabilities that we've chatted about in past conversations, a little bit of what we have coming in the pipeline. And this established next steps for what this trial period will look like. Any questions from the conservice side on any of that?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  So, I know you said that we'd probably discuss it later on about the actual add on portion of it. I was just wondering if it was 20 dollars per user. I think that's what the email said for the AI portion of it.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So for context on pricing is that's our list price, right? That's certainly not the price that we'll have for you. That's just the list price that we have on our pricing page. Part of those discussions will be around. Conservice. Obviously has a high volume. So, I can't tell you right now off the top of the bat, what that price will be, but it will be lower than that 20 dollar price point… but it gives us, you know, a rough estimate at least.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yep… any other questions that you might have or anything specifically you want to make sure that we cover?

Misty Warren (mwarren@conservice.com):
  All right. I'm going to start sharing my screen. I'm sure you have questions as we go through this. Let me make sure… I get the right one here.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  All right, perfect. So within your admin panel, you will see a section, you already have access to this. But for our hybrid AI, keep in mind this is per shared mailbox. So these settings, you know, if you only want to trial this for certain mailboxes, these do need to be enabled on a mailbox level, the ones that I want to walk through. So first, we have this bucketed in two different categories. So from an AI agent perspective, this is going to be things like our tagging, our sentiment analysis which I believe we've chatted about in the past. So to configure, I'm going to start with the AI tagging just for context. Obviously tagging is something that your team is already doing. It's a way for us to categorize emails that can then maybe power workflows. If we tag something as like a refund, maybe automatically assign it to a refund specialist. You can obviously automate this and you can do that through keywords. The thing is sometimes it's a little bit more nuanced, and it's hard to decipher every single keyword that we might need to add into an automation. And so this is where AI tagging comes into play. We can come in here and we can add from our existing tags or we can even create brand new tags and we can do things like for any sort of categorization. So if it's like a new invoice, for example, we can add those tags into the AI. What our system then needs is we simply need 10 emails, you notice here. We need 10 emails to be manually applied with that tag in order to train the system of when it should apply that tag. So these, in this case, these are still in what we would call a learning phase, right? We need 10 of those emails to be applied. Oh, I don't have any on this one but you'd also have an area where those are now past the learning phase and they're now in the section to start automatically applying the tags, you'll notice here that we have descriptions here. Oops, these are not generated yet, but it will automatically generate descriptions of when a payment dispute should be tagged. You can go ahead and edit those descriptions. So if there's more specifics that you would want to be applied to when we're applying that tag, you have a bit of control of those descriptions. So from a setup perspective, it's simple adding these tags, manually applying those 10 tags, it won't retroactively look at past tags. So it'll look at 10 tags that we've added manually from this point, then I can turn those on.

Misty Warren (mwarren@conservice.com):
  Let me see if I can actually find an example. Let me switch to another mailbox. Okay?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  So you notice here, this is where we can then say if we want those to automatically apply or not. And this is the description that we have for when a billing tag is applied. I can add on to this if I want, so that's the setup perspective. I'll go into more details, but I'm going to pause there. Any questions so far on how this works or specific to your teams, how you might envision this being applied?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  No, we've kind of messed around with it with the past week since it's been approved by the security team. And I think the AI tag portion of it is pretty self explanatory when it comes to training and adding new ones.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yep. And I don't know if I can find an example, but the tag will be denoted there's like a, I don't know the right word for it. So I just call it like it's like little.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Diamonds like a star.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Exactly. So it'll denote that this was applied by AI, and you'll also be able to if it was a false tag for any reason, you can flag that. We will say that we are seeing extremely high accuracy rates in the 95 percent range to start as you can imagine with anything AI that gets a lot more accurate as we go along. So you can see, it will denote that it was applied via AI in the tags.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Are there any scenarios that you think that we're not currently applying tags maybe through automations, that because we can use AI for a little bit more nuanced scenarios that would be worthwhile starting to tag those and categorize those types of emails.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  I'm not exactly sure if this is what you're referring to but like for the custom field for us, if that was able to just auto apply based off of the signature, that would be really helpful because right now I can't close the emails to avoid my team just closing them and not filling out those fields. But other than that, I think that the AI tag portion is working great. And if we need more, we can add more, we're just doing a couple like five test runs so that way we can monitor them for accuracy before we implement it on a larger scale.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yep. And can you clarify on the custom field? I didn't quite pick that up?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah. Sorry. So for the custom field, we have it where we can mark who it's coming from client billing account management. And in the emails typically in the signature, it'll say like billing manager, account manager, that sort of thing. So if AI was just able to grab that and plug it into that custom field, I would make things a little bit faster.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. So it sounds like you have a custom field to denote like where internally it's coming from, which team? Okay? So you want to know if it's coming from account managers from billing. And then you denote that with a, and that's manually being applied. It sounds like right now I have to look at it, see it's from which team. And then I add that to as a custom field.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Gotcha.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I would want to see one sample email, Eric, if possible. Yeah. So.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let's do this just for sake of time Destiny. If you want to maybe show me an example, you can email me an example. I'll work internally and see if that's something, you know, that our AI, you know, if that's in the works or something that we can maybe explore.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Yeah. We should be able to use AI extract to be able to, you know, get that information and put it in custom field. I think that's the use case here. Yeah.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So I'll start a line of communication, Destiny. But if you can just send maybe one or two examples of what that would look like and then we can dig on our side.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yep. Absolutely.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Perfect. All right. Any questions on the AI tagging before I move on to the next part of AI?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  All right. So the next part is our sentiment analysis. I think from our past conversations, this wouldn't be applicable to all teams. But if I recall correctly, Destiny, maybe your team, this one was something that was of interest. So very simple from a setup perspective, it's you know, it's simple. It's toggling it on or off and deciding do we want a three point rating scale or a five point scale? I personally prefer a five point. I think it's just a little bit more granular, more specific. It's from very negative to very positive. The other option is just a positive neutral negative. So up to you, but I do prefer the five point scale just like the AI tagging. We do have descriptors here which you can, you know, add to, right? So if there's something very specific to your team that you would want to flag as something that's you know, deemed a very negative conversation, you can add this in here from a, what does this look like on the front end perspective? Let me go to one of our mailboxes. Let me see if this is a good example. Okay? So if I'm in our mailbox, now, you'll notice that we now have some sentiment scores here from this view, right? So I can see the neutral ones, the negative ones. If I then click into an email, you notice on this one is flagged as negative. And if I hover over here, it's going to tell me why. So email expresses concern about a potential billing. So it's looking at the context of the email and then it's rating it as this thread evolves, right there's back and forth. This can update. So it'll show current, but it'll also show past ratings, right? So if this started off maybe as negative and is now positive, I can see that, right? So this is good in real time for if I'm working this email, I can see what this, you know, what the sentiment is. I can even see this, you know, as I'm looking at the inbox, what I think is even more powerful is we can then use the sentiment scores to power for either workflows or added visibility. What I mean by that is there's a few things we can do. So first we can create customized views, so we can use those sentiment scores as a filtering mechanism across the entire product, right? So if I wanted to create a customized view and I only wanted to see our very negative conversations, I don't have any. So let's include negative, right? So I can filter those out. And then I could actually save this as a customized view. And I can in real time just see all of those conversations that maybe are not going well, that might need some sort of intervention from maybe supervisor or leadership. So that's the first piece. The second piece is, I can also then include that same filtering mechanism into an automation. So what we're seeing a lot of teams do is, so they might say when this sentiment is updated on any conversation and that sentiment is usually we're seeing this with negative. Obviously, there's some things you could do with positive, maybe leave a review, something like that. But normally we're seeing this with our negative sentiments. And then I can add an action. So it could be as simple as maybe add a follower, add Destiny as a follower to these types of emails. I could reassign it. I can add a tag as escalation, I can auto reply, right? So there's a number of things that we can do just depending on how you want to handle these. And again, keep in mind this is in real time. The AI is looking at those emails. It's in real time, adjusting that sentiment rating. And then this allows you to power something within your workflow or as simple as added visibility.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  What questions do you have on this front for sentiment?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  The only thing that I was wondering about the sentiment is it seems like it marks things as negative if there's not a response or like a resolution, is that safe to say? Like there's a couple of them where it gets marked as negative when it says mailbox not found. Is that like typical? Just like if there's no way to resolve the email, then it marks it negative automatically.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Sorry, when you say mailbox not found, can you clarify?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah. If we send out an outgoing email, usually my team for collections, it'll say mailbox not found, if the email is not valid?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. So it's like it's an auto response? Basically. Okay… Anurag. I.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Know that there's a way to train it. I was just trying to get more like in depth of what it's looking for to mark things negative versus positive.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we have a description field, right? So we will need to update that description to help you for these specific cases, right? So, and… you can also test it in your emails, right? So whenever it is marking it as an urgent or non, sorry, negative or not very negative, right? You can come here and change the description and it will start working for you in that manner.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Okay.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  And Anurag, if I, if they like move these to let's say neutral. I imagine the system will also learn that these, you know, it's always these like bounce back emails that it should learn from that and maybe update, the.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  way that it's learning, no, this learning, no, no, this learning, we have not added over here. It is there in the tags. So, in auto tags, if you report email, right? So there it will learn but not here.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Okay. So the sentiment doesn't have learning capabilities except for in the descriptions quite yet?

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Yes, you are right.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Okay.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Good question.

Michael McCuin (mmccuin@conservice.com):
  Eric, do you know what the reporting looks like on this? Would we be able to pull say for the month? And, you know, we started out with 15 negative and we moved up five of those to neutral. Anything that way that we can, you know, kind of do a high level for any type of, you know, monthly reporting to higher ups?

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Change of sentiment is something that we are working on right now that is not present in this particular view. But yes, that is something that is on our roadmap.

Michael McCuin (mmccuin@conservice.com):
  Okay. So right now, we can see what's live. And as that changes, that will change these. But as far as like a history that's being worked on.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Right. So this is the current state, of the conversations, right? So, at this point of time.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  But yes, we have got a lot of requests around sentiments… changing from negative to positive that information, is very useful.

Michael McCuin (mmccuin@conservice.com):
  Awesome. Thank you.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Yep. Good.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Questions. Anything else on the sentiment side?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  I think that that's all I have right now for that.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Switching gears. I'm going to move over to the co pilot, right? Some of these you're actually familiar with AI summarizer is something we've had for a bit AI compose. So obviously being able to draft emails or refine emails, these are now encompassed in this AI. The big difference here or the big addition is this ask AI. So something I wanted to talk about this is what we talked a lot about on site is our knowledge sources. So ask AI is essentially our AI co pilot where within an email, let me go to an email. I can hit this AI co pilot and I can summarize conversation. I can draft replies and we can feed the system knowledge sources, right? So if there are like how to process a refund, if there's documentation on how to do that, where you then simply want to have that information for your team to automatically like input that information? I know we talked a lot about like the teams are using help juice. Do you have internal documents that your team refers to that maybe we can use as just during this testing phase? Do you have maybe how to's or refund policies or things that your team would be referencing as they're answering some of these questions that come in?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  We do have some yeah, at least for my team, we have like… ones that reference imports as well as what different forms are used for and who can fill them out. So we do have a couple like Google docs that we can submit. And then we have the help juice docs. And then we have like a quick contacts list. Like if it's coming from this department or references esg billing, then it would go to this person or this email.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. So especially during this, you know, trial phase, I think if there's some of those documents that we can upload download and then upload here as sources. That would be a good testing, you know, start to the testing regarding help juice. Is that I've heard, you know, from all the teams I've talked about. I've gotten different kind of insights on help juice. How do you guys feel about your specific teams on the billing side? Do you have help juice in a good place? Is it managed? Is it up to date? Are you referencing that frequently, what's the feeling around that as your knowledge source? And how you guys use that as an, you know, within your teams?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  It kind of depends on the topic. I know myself and my team, we've updated a couple of the KB articles that we reference. I know for a fact that some of them are a little bit outdated and not quite as up to date. But like the source information is usually still good on this. Okay, there just might be a slight policy change.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Gotcha. The reason I asked, we're obviously exploring other areas of knowledge bases. Hiver's, knowledge bases. I know we're exploring things like notion, right? So I just wanted to get an understanding of if we start exploring this, how confident do you feel that help juice is in a good state where it's actually a reliable source. If we were to get to a point where right? We could integrate?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  I think for the most part, help juice would be a good source if that was something that we wanted to continue using. If we choose to continue with the AI portion of it, at least for the questions, while it comes to specific tasks, all the steps might not be there. But like seeing questions, what different departments do, all of that information is pretty accurate in help juice.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. For the time being, like I said, let's get maybe some of those handful of sources that we know your teams would be using, say it's a Google doc, we can download that and upload it into here. We can also include snippets. So if there's anything that you wanted to write as a snippet as a knowledge source. And then lastly, we can also include, let me go to an email. I can oops, where did it go… for any closed conversation? I can add it to the co pilot. So if there's like a response that you really want to use as a great example of how to handle certain scenarios, we can add those as sources as well. Any questions on this? And then Anurag, any questions for the conservice team, just about knowledge sources in general, that would be helpful for us?

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I also wanted to ask, so you have certain information available in the help juice, right? Do you think there is some amount of knowledge which can be… gained from the responses which are sent over the email, do you think there is an opportunity to grab knowledge… from there as well?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah. With my team having such a wide variety of issues that come up to us, I definitely think that learning based off of how we respond to certain emails would be really helpful with the AI tools?

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Also, when you say the knowledge will be useful, right? So what kind of email conversations will be the star conversations? So the conversation which gets resolved, right? Would… be the conversations most likely that are kind of our star conversations to look for, right?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  I'm so sorry, could you repeat that?

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  So the knowledge source from the responses, right? So when do you think we should, you know, learn from the conversation? So I am assuming that when the email gets resolved, that would mean that whatever we can learn from the emails will be important, right?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah… I think definitely, when it's once they're fully resolved… one thing that my team struggles with is closing emails prior to them being finished. So I could see that maybe causing some issues if the AI was trying to learn from slowly closed emails.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  So you're saying you don't close it from the right panel? Is it, if you see on the right panel, you don't use this button to close, is it?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah. We do. They just, we're working on it and I tell them not to, but my team will close them even if it's not fully resolved. So on the right hand side, it'll say close, but we just ask the client a question rather than it being fully done. They don't utilize pending as often as they should.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Do you think if, while somebody is trying to close, if we can just show a warning that there is some unresolved issue in this email? Do you think that will be helpful… if AI can identify that some problem is not resolved?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah, that might be helpful. I also think maybe having a send and tend option as well as the send and close option would probably prevent a lot of it as.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Well, We are also working on a feature named as AI QA, which is called as, you know, quality analysis, right? So you will be able to see how many agents are actually closing… the email without fully resolving the, without… fully resolving the issues, right? If you look here, right? This average score, completeness clarity and tone, you will be able to see, how much they're actually replying, right? Or how many, how much, how many emails are actually completely resolving, right? This is something that we are kind of building. This is an AI native feature.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah, that would be really cool.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  And sorry to interrupt Anurag. I know we're at time. Do you have a few additional minutes or you guys have a hard stop?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  I have a few additional minutes. The other two tend to be a little bit more swamped with meetings than I do?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. So apologies for the time. I will, I'm going to go at least through this with Destiny and if you need to jump, Michael, missy, no problem. She can give you the rundown. I want to show you a few last items before closing out here. Should take no more than five minutes. So just to round out with the co pilots, I'm sure you've seen this.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  But so this lives here in the AI co pilot and this is where we can summarize draft replies and insert those directly and that will be tying in with those knowledge sources that we mentioned, right? So if I needed to draft a reply, we could automatically draft that, pulling in some information from those knowledge sources and insert those in so that's would there.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  be a way to train that? Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but would there be a way to train this if like the reply wasn't accurate to what the email needs?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Anurag, I'm going to lean on you on that question.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Sorry, I could not understand. Can you please repeat once?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Yeah. So if we did the draft a reply option on the AI and it wasn't accurate to what needs to happen on the email, would there be a way to train it? Saying actually, I think that this should happen instead? And then the AI could learn from that.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Yeah, right. Right. So thanks for asking that question, right? So we are actually building a module named as coaching AI. Okay? So the supervisors, right? They can actually review what kind of answers are being answered and they can actually train the AI to let know that, no, this is not the right information and this is the right information and you can actually make it learn based on what you want AI to respond to. But yes, as Eric is showing, right, you can always give more commands. You can customize it based on what kind of draft you would want to send.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  All right, perfect. And then the last thing to bring us home, this is actually prototypes that I started showing as Anurag was started talking about the QA, this is not available yet, but it will be, and this is what we're calling AI QA. I think this came up from all the teams I spoke with especially on the account management side, but I think with your teams as well is this will be a way for us to QA the responses that our teams are delivering, right? So we'll have different categories, greetings tone, clarity, complete lists, right? So as we're analyzing the responses that your team is going, we'll be rating these different categories. What that then looks like here we were showing the reports is right? We can start understanding based on those different categories across our team, how they're performing, right? This can help with coaching or automatically qaing those, I think your teams are manually looking at maybe a handful every so often, right? So that can help on this front, if we can have those different categories and looking at the performance across time and across team members.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  And I know time's a little bit, but what like specifically is it looking for QA? Is it just like if it's been, oh, I see it right there. It says completeness tone… is there, would there be a way to, is this like where you can do the description of what specifically you're looking for like you can with the AI sentiment or is it just like general, this is the standard?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah, Anurag from a, you will.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Be, yeah, you will be able to, you will be able to customize it based on your needs.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Okay, awesome.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  And then last thing I wanted to show is just like what that looks like for your agents, right? So we'll start having more prompts of as I'm writing an email based on those suggestions, those categories that we have, right? Analyzing in real time and saying, okay, maybe we need to add a greeting or maybe we need to make it more professional, whatever those categories that we have it'll look at those in real time and add some suggestions for improvements.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Okay. Awesome. Yeah, this is super cool.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  So, this isn't available. Oh, go ahead.

Anurag M (anurag@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Sorry, this is for the agents, right? So we are expecting that more they use this feature, the reporting will be better, right? So we have built this in order for, you know, helping the actual agents who are replying payments.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Perfect. All right. Well, apologies for going over a few minutes, but that's everything we wanted to show you. So in terms of what this looks like, we want to give you this access through towards the end of the year, just keeping in mind the holidays, I think December is probably a good day. So it gives you more than a month, about a month and a half to work through this.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Obviously if you have questions as you're working through this, happy to help or jump on any additional calls. And then I'd like to schedule something towards that end to review how things have been working out. And if it makes sense of, you know, discussing any more next steps, any questions on the conserva side of anything either on the AI capabilities or, you know, kind of what this trial period looks like?

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  I don't have any questions right now Misty, what about you? Nothing yet? I will reach out though if there are any.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. I'll send a follow up. Also just included some documentation on the capabilities in case you forget or want to look through it again, establishing the timelines. And then, you know, in the coming weeks, I think I'll work to get something set up for some future conversations.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Okay. Awesome.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  All right. Thanks everyone for the time. We're excited for this.

Destiny Roche (droche@conservice.com):
  Thank you.
