Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  I think we… were all, they did a good job. Whatever the issues were from their standpoint.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I was flying out of Boston. I was supposed to fly out on Thursday, got delayed four hours while I was in the airport, then canceled, stayed another night, delayed four hours. The next day took 30 hours to fly 30 minutes back to New York from Boston.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  That's crazy. I know a couple people put holds on rental cars just in case they had to drive back so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Everyone was ready for all sorts of ways. Yeah, I couldn't even take the train back. All the amtrak's were sold out. Couldn't even take the amtrak back.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  That's nuts?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You know, I appreciate, you know, you guys hopping on. I saw Manoj just joined. So he's a solutions specialist here at hiver who's going to be, you know, assisting us with the conversation today. But yeah, just kind of wanted to, you know, use this time to help you all get set up with hiver and answer some of those questions that you had over email. So I'll just kick it on over to you and then Manoj will assist us here.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Thanks. I think one of our main problems is at the moment that the way the filters are set up. So I'll step back. What we did this morning, right? Was actually turned on our purchasing inbox and set it up as a shared inbox through hiver so that it was connected. And now we're seeing the filters, we have the filters that are coming through from hiver, and we have the filters that we're currently getting. We have set up through just Gmail generally, not too big of an issue. Just what we're seeing so far. The problem that we're seeing right now is that those filters are not bypassing the inbox. So they're not going to their designated folder. They're being assigned to that folder, but they're also staying in the inbox, which is something we're not used to and we don't want to happen. Is there a way to have the filters work? So that the emails are bypassing the inbox and moving into just the folders that they're already labeled for.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So if I understood, right? These filters are part of your purchasing inbox?

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Correct.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So now, users, okay. So you, sorry… no, go ahead. Okay. So the users are logging into purchasing app, and when they log in, they're going to directly go into the Gmail folders, where their emails are, and they answer through that account, right?

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Correct. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So they're not going into their personal emails. This is just in the purchasing shared inbox. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. So, the thing is once you have hiver, these users do not have to log into purchasing app, right? They'll be logging into their individual accounts and then handling the purchasing emails from within the shared mailbox, right? Correct? Currently, there is one user and one, but like only one user in the account. So rest of them are, I understand, like rest of them are still logging into purchasing app. But what basically might happen is your Gmail filter to skip the inbox might trigger right away. But then when hiver gets the alert, do an API call to sync the same email, right? It might get pushed back to the inbox. So it all depends on like which syncs first and which triggers second.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So when it, like, you know, this is something that the users might be experiencing if they keep logging into purchasing app?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So what we're recommending Manoj is just to test hiver with the teams logging into their individual inboxes with the purchasing associated with hiver.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Yep. You're still seeing it even in your own inbox, not passing just into the folders. It's staying in the inbox as well, correct? Yeah. So, which,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I think it's also because this does get sent to purchasing. So it gets sent to purchasing and my personal inbox.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  That's going to be the case. So if it gets sent to like, is there any way, even if they're working in their personal inbox that it doesn't go into the inbox, it still goes directly into a folder that they have, whether that be in their personal or just in their, in the purchasing inbox. Okay? So, like,

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  so, even that is going to be like a repeated steps that you'll have to follow because the filter might trigger for the first few emails, right? And then still Gmail is going to recognize your logged in email address present anywhere in the email chain and that it'll get pushed back to the inbox?

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  So, how do we get it set up so that it's not going into the inbox, is there a way? Okay?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So… right now, it depends on the workflow, how you work. So, our recommended workflow is that let's say that you are logging into your individual accounts and handling the purchasing as a mailbox itself. Now, while responding to emails, you start responding using purchasingad but have your own email signature present so that your end users still know it's coming from you, but it's coming from the purchasing email address. Yeah, you maintain the conversations within the purchasing email address, so that those emails will just stick to the hiver folders. And your inbox is clean of only the emails that are directly sent to you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you're going to want to add everyone into hiver and you can create a setting where it's like send as shared mailbox id, and then it won't have to go to people's personal inboxes anymore. You'll just be all working out of hiver with that collaborative view and all that stuff.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Even through there, it's still going to be sitting in your inbox in your personal email. Is that correct?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you'll log in with your personal email and you'll have access to the purchasing inbox in that folder on the bottom left from hiver. So above it, you'll have your personal inbox, which you click into. And right below it, you'll have the shared mailbox where everyone has visibility.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I can just give you it'll look like this, right? So… you know, you have my personal view up top, which is like all my personal emails. And then below these shared inboxes, in this case, the legal team, shared mailbox, where we'll have, you know, things associated with this shared mailbox?

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  If we… put everybody into either today?

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Experience would be similar to what we're seeing today. Do you think that would clear up any of the issues… we put them in today? And we had them all working through hiver, like at least here, like when we're looking at the purchase like in the shared inbox, like I can just archive these. It still goes to them. But if we move to hiver today, we don't have those filters.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We can create those filters in hiver, so they're called tags and they work very similarly. Yeah.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Yeah. I'm just saying like if we were to move them all into it today, like currently in hiver, we don't have like the filters or the tags created right now. So like, but are they going to be able to manage it how they normally do by going to a folder and saying these are the, these… are this vendor that I need to handle or are they going to see everything in a running list? So that's what you're saying these tags over there. So like within purchasing, I mean does each person like, so like we, some of the payment, some of the ways we make payments are like wire requests. So a lot of times in the purchasing inbox, agents would have their individual like wire request folder. So that way they can go through and review wire requests. All at once. Do those tags go like by agent or is it just a general, hey, these are all wire requests, but it doesn't really? Okay. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So it can be a combination, right? You can create customized views for yourself that are requests for you. You can have standard reviews that are org wide that everyone can see or you can also just have the tag view. So it's very customizable.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Guys, just an additional question. So right now, does… maximum of your workflow depends on the filters that are there in the purchasing inbox?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And would it be all right if you guys could show me those filters like what kind of filters they are?

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Yeah. So we tried to do that in the past of trying to export all of them. I mean there is a ginormous list and some of them are very outdated. So we don't have anything that's really clean that we can do. But let's… say if you try to export them, so we… can get essentially the… code in the background. It says this XML file does not appear to have any style information, blah, blah, blah, and it's literally like the coding of each of the filters. Would you be able to do anything with that information?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  I can ask the engineering team, right? I can, you know, if you could share me the file, I can just ask them what kind of filters they are, or let's say that if you could get screenshots, I can ask that as well, whether we could replicate that. But just an additional question here, does most of your filters include like emails coming from certain people having certain keywords assign it to. So and so person and add a tag maybe in hiver?

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Correct.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Will that work as an automation setup for you?

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. And these, so what kind of identifications do you have right now? Like is it just the email domains which is like which has more number? Like do you have certain customer base for each user who's handling them? Do you have setup like that?

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  I have some that are based off of the, who they're from and the subject line. Okay. Some that are just who it's from. I'd say most of them start off with who it's from, and then kind of having some like sub filter or sub labels that might get split off like if it has a certain subject, but I'd say like.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Handles that supplier.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. And.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  This is something we can implement pretty quick. So like, you know, if you did, you know, move forward with hiver, like this is something where I dedicate and we can help throughout the testing as well to test this. But like throughout like a further partnership like someone would actually create all this for you and map out to your entire process. So just something to keep in mind as well.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's something we could definitely, you know, do in a number of ways by our rule based automations. We can also create bulk automations with like excel sheets where it's like, you know, from this vendor map to this person type stuff.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Dylan's sending that over now. So just let us know if there's anything that you can do with that file, the way that it is, if we have to get put it together in a different way. I don't know how quickly we'll be able to do that, but, we can try to work on it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's perfect. I think.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  The goal was kind of start with, we wanted to get the purchasing inbox connected and then kind of have some other people join in on the testing of working in like their personal email using hiver. Yeah, see what their thoughts were. But then we jumped, we came into a couple of the issues of like conversation view was off in purchasing. So that kind of created some redundant emails and then the labels not being skipping or not skipping the inbox. So I just want to make sure like if we bring, I want to bring a couple of people over to help test hiver, but I want to make sure that the rest that we're not bringing over to test are still able to function as they would in purchasing without changing that process. Were you able to leave the purchasing inbox? Do.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  you want to touch on that? Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, it's about, we are not going to make any drastic changes to your purchasing inbox right now. The issue that you guys are facing that the emails are still part of the inbox, that might be one off case because we need the emails to be present in the inbox to be able to sync into the shared mailbox… because if it's archived, if the inbox label is being removed in the source account, right? When the initial API call happens and the email is not present there again, there are high chances that emails might get missed. So that is the one scenario that's going to be little complicated for the users who are logging into the purchasing inbox. But apart from that, we do not touch anything. Your emails are still, every email is still going to sync to the source account. We are simply fetching it to the shared mailbox, right? They'll still be able to reply from the purchasing inbox, and the replies will also sync across all the users. So there's not going to be any missed conversations as well.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, but I think that's a good next step like getting some team members in there to get a feel for it… and we can use maybe the call tomorrow to talk about any questions that the team might have or something like that.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Yeah. All right. Well, we will, I think we should leave the system how we have it set up today. Try to get a couple more people on it and just see if we can work through this. If it becomes unbearable for the team that's still logging into the purchasing inbox, then we may have to pull it and try to work it a different way. But, and we'll try to live through it for the next two days and then see what we can do from there. Just keep an update day by day.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. That sounds good. And keep us posted. We're here to answer any questions and we can hop in and call whenever need be. And if you know, if the team really likes it and they think it's going to be beneficial, maybe we can work on getting the whole team involved in hiver as well and do like a training and stuff like that.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Yeah… we can definitely talk through that as we get closer to December.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, but no, that's that sounds good. So I'll talk to both of you soon and let us know if there's anything else we can do in the meantime.

Alec Pool (apool@ecstuning.com):
  Sounds good. Thanks Cole. Okay. All.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  right. Bye.
