Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Morten, can you hear me? Yes. Okay, perfect. There we go. Hi, how are you? Doing?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  I'm great. Thanks and you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you. Shall we get started with the discussion or expecting more people to join in as well?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  We can just begin it's perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Great. Thank you for scheduling this session with us today. My name is Yukta and I'll be helping you with the evaluation. So before we begin, I would just want to understand in terms of what you're working on today, which made you sort of look out for a tool like hiver in the market so that accordingly, I can assist you from there.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Sure. We are looking for a tool for our support team to help minimize the time we spend on queries, we get every single day. So we're looking for some kind of tool that can work together with our auto management system and with our website and all the materials we have and all the information we have about materials and fabrics and so on. Got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It, could you help me understand how this is done today? What, you know, how many people do we have in the support team and how are they managing these inquiries as of today?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  We are six people working in the support team and we get everything directly in outlook mail, and then each people have like different areas to work with. But we get the idea is that we get so many of the same problems every single day. So we can take out, hopefully we can take out maybe 50 percent of that just with some easy AI platform. So the goal is to find something, that can help the everyday work for the support team?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So you receive like repetitive sort of emails related to same topic discussion on a day to day basis that you would want to automate in some way? Yes. Got it. That makes sense. Do you have a generic email address at which you're receiving these emails today that everybody's logging into and then picking up? Yes. Okay. Got it. Any specific trigger that sort of makes you think that you need a better process of course automation is one that you mentioned anything else that you see is causing friction?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  No, not really. I would say we're just looking, to scale the business and not to just add more people to the support team. We want people that to get focused on the things that actually need to get focused on. And then all the easy part just skip it, and hopefully get some AI agent, to help with the all the easy questions.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah, makes sense. And are you the one who is sort of heading this team today? Could you tell me a little bit about your role as well?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Yes, I'm a sales manager, and I'm also doing like research and development. So, I'm like developing and go around to see what we can add to the business, to scale it and to improve, the different areas, of the business, support and marketing, or sales or the production team. So, so I'm not the, I've been working at the support team. So I know everything that's going on but I'm not the head of support or not working at support.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So how is this going to pan out like once you know, as you are evaluating these tools currently, and if you like the tool, are you the one who's going to be proposing this for the support team or how is it going to move from your end?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Yes, it is both for the support team and also for our CEO who's going to have the final wording.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And will you also be part of this in case you implement something for the support team here? Would you also be part of that, you know, shared inbox that we would be creating? Yes.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Yes. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And is there any timeline by when you're looking to implement this or you have just started the evaluation?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Just here in the beginning of the, yeah, 20 point six. So, yeah, hopefully in the first couple of months?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Cool. I think I can show you what we have, and then we can bit from there in case this resonates with what you're looking for. Let me just share my screen quickly. Let me know if you can see it.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  I can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So just a quick introduction. Morten hiver is a AI powered customer service tool that helps you sort of streamline all customer service function and also make sure that we are scaling and doing certain things through AI and making sure that we are only focusing on having those fruitful interactions with the customers on a day to day basis. So, hiver works on this URL called app, hiverhq. Com, where you log in using your outlook credentials. Like I have done here from my email address, this is what everybody will do who needs to be on hiver. We would be creating a shared inbox that will be connected to your support generic email address that everybody is logging into today. So that we avoid doing that. So that we know at all times which user is actually responsible for what. So that we can define clear ownership associated to each email that is coming in. So as you can see, I have my personal inbox connected here as well. So in case you want, you can also connect your individual email address so that you don't have to hop between outlook and hiver. And then below, you have your shared inboxes. So since I'm part of different departments in my company, hence I am, you see different inboxes here, like finance, HR, operations, sales support. This also means that hiver does not just cater to one department in a company which is support. But as long as you have a generic email address, you can also expand this to other departments as well. For today's. Instance, we'll take an example of support. Assuming that this is the one that this is how it's going to look like for you as well. We will add all six to seven individuals who need to be part of this. And how this is going to flow from here, is, you would have these sections that will define your day to day workflow. We would want to make sure that we automate most of the process as well. So all the emails that are being written at this email address are going to be coming in this section called unassigned. There could be chances that we can create certain workflows in the backend. So, for example, if we know emails related to a certain topic are all handled by Yukta, then we can create those automations and workflows as well. So that such emails get automatically assigned to her. So that they don't land into this section called unassigned. For now, I have one email that is sitting here. I will go here and you would have this activity panel on the right side from where we can actually do a couple of things we can give the ownership as to who needs to work on this email so that we have clear transparency. Anybody can do that. And let's say I want to assign this to myself. I will find this email sitting in the mind section here. So the mind section will be different for each individual depending on what emails they are working on today. From here. As I start working on any email, I will have my AI co pilot to help me drafting the response here. And this is going to be helpful when we talk about the repetitive emails or the emails that are more contextual. We need certain information to be able to respond here. So the AI is going to work as your personal assistant. We will train the AI on your company resources. You can feed your notion PDF, anything that you seem relevant here for AI to train and understand about your company. And while I'm working on any email, I can ask AI to either draft a response for me, reading this email that has come in. I can ask any question here that will help me sort of be able to get to this email. This is one way other way would be for all standard responses. You can also use hiver's email templates, repository. When you can actually store all the repetitive responses that you keep sending to your customers, right? Wherein I don't really have to then write the entire response. I just pick the right template that I see relevant. I just insert it in the email, fill the placeholders right here and then just hit send, right? So this is the way that we can respond to emails and specifically what you mentioned in terms of making sure that we close such emails a lot faster, right? Once I'm done, I'll just come here and change the status from open to closed. Since I've already worked on this email and not expecting any more response. Any questions so far from the workflow?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  No, it looks like pretty much the same as using copilot in outlook. Okay? When opening the AI chat on the right side, it looks pretty much the same as copilot.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, but this is sitting on your, you know, ticketing tool. Basically, here you're also, it's not just the AI that you're working with but you're actually managing the entire workflow from, you know, assigning emails to different individuals, creating workflows on the backend depending on who needs to work on which email, so that it gets, you know, assigned to them, which you are not able to do today in the outlook by having everyone logging into the same account, right? With that, you're also able to track the progress as to, you know, whether this email is currently open, whether it's in pending or it's already been closed, which means it has been worked on. And with that, you can also categorize your emails with the help of tags, right? So as soon as an email gets assigned to, you can actually see the email and understand what this email is about without having to really go through it. And that gets done with the help of tags here, right? Abc tag is applied on this email. And likewise, you can create your own repository or a bucket of tags that are important for you, that will help you sort of categorize your emails into different categories, right? So that we can automatically apply those tags as soon as the email comes in or we can manually apply those tags to sort of differentiate each email from, you know, one another. And when you go into the tag section, this is where you can see all emails related to one topic itself. Right now. You might think that tags is also something which is available in outlook. You can actually label different types of type of emails into different tags with the help of automations there or rules in outlook. But this is where, you know, that remains for a specific inbox itself. So the core idea here is to make sure that we have that understanding of ownership, right? The ownership is the most important piece that you are going to be solving with hiver. That may not be done today with the help of, you know, everybody logging into the same account and working on those emails. Does that make sense? Or do?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  You have, yes. Okay. I think actually, I like the idea of people logging in on their own but still having a, all the different mailboxes, their own mailbox, personal mailbox, everything goes to the unassigned and then afterwards gets to the main box and so on. So, yeah, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I mean, that is one. And also, you know, if you go into the team section here, this is your central hub, right? For everyone to be able to see. We have 23 open emails right now. But how are these distributed between different individuals, right? This visibility, also you get here wherein, you know, okay, Jeevan has one open email that he's working on. Manoj has one that he's working on. And from here, we can actually do a lot of collaboration between each other as well because let's say Rakesh is working on four emails. And if I click on any one of these as a manager, if I want to understand what's happening on this one, why is it still open till since December seventeenth, right? So I can just drop him a quick note in this section called add a note and I can actually add mention him, ask him for an update or please update on this one or, you know, put any message for our internal communication, so that we make sure that Rakesh is the ultimate owner here. He has the accountability to close this email. And multiple people can still collaborate on the same thread, right? So this is something that could be useful as well. And if someone is out of office, you can just easily go ahead and reassign those emails to someone else so that we make sure nothing slips through the crack and we are on top of these emails. Do you think this aspect of it is important to you? Or is this something that's not really, you know, that much of a priority?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  It is, it is very important. Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. So this is the basic workflow that I've just showed you Martin. Apart from it, we have analytics to see different metrics you can put up in SLA to make sure we are responding to these emails on time. Any, are you interested on, in any of these things?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Yes, yes. But I think the most important part is to, can this one? Can it be connected to the, our auto management system?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Which system are you using?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  It's called trade TR a ED?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  TR a ED?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  TR a ED trade? Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Trade, and what is it about this system? We do have open apis and some native integrations as well. Could you explain to me as to what exactly you would want to achieve with this integration?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  I want to have to get the AI to answer on delivery dates because, we make furniture, so, and pretty much everything is made to order. So, the lead time is six to eight weeks and it can depend. And due to Christmas or holidays or some production malfunctions, it can vary sometimes. So I want to have it to, when a customer asks us what's the delivery time, what's the expected delivery time? It can check directly into the order and see, okay, the expected delivery time is the fifth of February. Yeah, something like that. Oh.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You want AI to train itself on going into this system that you have, and then auto responding to these emails?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Yes, exactly.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And what this system is about again?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Yeah, it's just for orders, pretty much just orders.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  No, TR a E.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Tra.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Ete… is this the right? Yes, trade.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Com.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. It's an ERP solution. Got it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Perfect. So, we do have integrations, right? So as you can see under apps here, we have certain native integrations as well, like with Netsuite, Jira, Salesforce, Trello, and all of that. And I'm sure that this integration that you're talking about can be achieved as well. We can integrate with trade. And with this integration, what it's going to help you is when you're working on any email without having to go into that system to understand delivery date or other details, those details are going to pop up right here. And you can actually get all the details that you see here. So it will give you the delivery date or all information in regards to this particular order that you're currently working on or exchanging emails on so that you can directly, you know, put those details here and inform the customer accordingly. But the ask that you have, which is AI to read into your ERP, that is something which is not possible today with hiver because hiver as of today, from the AI knowledge source perspective, it only supports knowledge base from the external sources. It supports documents, team like company policies, notion documents, or you can put certain documents, right? Which are static, right? So, these are the kind of sources that currently our AI supports, it's, not going to support, you know, something dynamic which is changing on a day to day basis.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Okay. But if we can like upload documents with all the delivery dates, maybe?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Each week? Yeah, it will work. Okay. Sure. Yeah, it will work. You can do that, then absolutely AI will train itself on it and then it can help you. If the email comes in asking, where is my delivery date? How does that look like? You can just ask AI to draft that response for you? And you can just put it in the email and it's good to go.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Okay. So it can work if we give it some documents, something update something maybe each week?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can do that. Yes. On a week on week. I think that should be okay on a day to day basis. I would still not say it will work perfectly because then daily, you would not want to upload documents in AI. So I think weekly is still doable. Okay.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  And then if we have a lot of information about all the materials, fabrics and so on, we have like a big in house academy guide to all our products and everything. Can it be implemented in some way? Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can absolutely upload it here in the hiver AI.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Okay. Yeah. Okay. Sure.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. We actually do a seven day free trial as well. So I would highly recommend if you want to try that, I can help you with the implementation. We can set up this account. Even if we set up the account connecting with your email address. Nothing's going to change in your additional outlook account. The team can continue working as how they're doing. We would just recommend to have at least two to three people for the testing so that you guys can see how it's actually working for you and further implement it. If everything looks good?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Yes, I would like that. So then I can check it and test it and see how it's working. Yeah, we can do, I guess the AI is learning from all the answers we give it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, it learns. Yeah, exactly. So the AI works exactly as what knowledge you put in there, what documents you put in there and accordingly, you know, it sort of trains itself on those, you know, information. Okay?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Perfect. Okay. Yeah. But if it's possible to get some kind of free trial to test, it would be, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We can do that.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  It would be very good. I.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  can actually help you setting it up right now. If you have the password to this account yourself, we can actually set it up now or we can schedule a meeting probably tomorrow if that suits you better.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Let's just set it up now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then share your screen with me if you can. And then we can get started.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Can you see my screen?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Now, I can see it. Yes. Could you just click on start free trial? Please… continue with Microsoft? Yeah… email.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect here or you could just put your company phone number, what… you're comfortable? Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  See you… here. You put the support email address?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Yes, I have just put mine. Oh, I have to do it. Yeah… but can I put something else just to not link up or ruin the support team's mail as it is right now?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Nothing's going to change in their outlook even if you put the support email address here, it's all going to just remain in hiver if that's the concern. Otherwise, you can use a dummy account as well.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Okay. I'll probably use a dummy account.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Just make sure that you know, the password of that email address. So to authenticate?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's a user account, right?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  It.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  has its own password?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  No, it does not… just put it in.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Okay. Yeah, nope. Okay. Otherwise, I could just do it tomorrow probably.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can try the other email address that you were putting bha, one. Yeah.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  But I have to, I don't know the password for that one.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then in that case, you'll have to get the admin approval from probably the it team so that to approve hiver as a third party tool that you would like to use and add in your Microsoft family. So that is going to be a one step that you'll have to get done before we get started with hypo. Okay?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Sure. Okay. Well, I know they are not here today, so I'll probably have to do it some other day that's.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  fine. Whenever you are not the admin of Microsoft. I'm assuming, right? You wouldn't have the admin. Yeah. So I think that usually gets done through id. So you could just get that done. Hardly will take about two minutes for them to get the clearance. And once you can just continue with this, it's very easy to set it up and we can then reconnect, if not tomorrow, just to be on a safer site probably on Thursday, and I can help you with the rest of the process if that helps?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Yeah, we can, but yeah, let me check with the support team before, and then I can get back to you, and we can, and we can see how it's working.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is it okay if we just put a placeholder for Thursday around the same time for a quick?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  No, I'm out first.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  I didn't have to be, no, it's not good as well. Okay. Let me probably get back to you tomorrow. Yeah?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Tomorrow. I can also connect just, no.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  But yeah, I will talk with the team tomorrow, and then I can get back to you and then we can maybe arrange the day next week. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That also works for me. You can let me know or do you want to put something for next week on the calendar just to make sure that we are not missing on this? No?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Let me get back to you on to tomorrow. Then. I know, no, yeah. What's what's working and what's not working? No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Problem at all. Then. Let me know. I think the only thing that you need to done, you need to get done is the admin approval, anything that you would want to discuss as well with the support team here. Would you want to include someone in this evaluation?

MortenCoffAndersen:
  I think for now, it's probably good. I probably just have to test it and see how it's working and see if it's something we can maybe implement in some at some point. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then let me know. I'll share the details with you with the email and horror probably can follow up or you could only let me know as to how you would like to proceed. And then accordingly, we can take it forward. Yes.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Let's do so all.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right then. Thank you so much Maureen for your time, take.

MortenCoffAndersen:
  Care. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries. Bye bye bye.
