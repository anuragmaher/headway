Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hello? Hi, migdad. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hello? Can you hear me?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hello? Yes.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Just give me five minutes, Yukta.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Five minutes. It's gonna be a little longer, okay? Then?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  At least one minute.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes. Shall we get started with the discussion? Yes, perfect. Could you also help me with your name? How do you pronounce it?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  You can call me migdad.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Migdad. Okay. Great. Thank you, migdad for scheduling this meeting. I'll be helping you with the evaluation. I know that you have set up the trial with us with the shared inbox support at the rate. If you could just help me understand what exactly you're looking for. I can accordingly assist you.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Okay. So, we are into financial services and we are dealing mutual fund distributions and stock blocking. We are based out of Kochi and we started the company 10 years back, okay? And we are dcb licensed stock brokers and amfi licensed mutual fund distributors.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  And so the challenge we are facing is that, you know, we are providing most of the support through the emails and we have a different department like relationship, sales and dealings, and there are different departments in there. So everyone is having a separate email id, something like support at pentad, in dealings, at pentad, in relationship at pentad, in, there are so many emails out there. And now, what happened is that we shared the credentials with all those employees who are in the department. So like if I'm working on the support desk, I have the access to the support desk and I know the password of the support desk email, and I'm logging with that email id in my Gmail. Similarly, all my colleagues who are working on the support desk are using the same email. Now, the problem is that if somehow someone is resigned from my company, I need to reset the password just to restrict him access in my email. So when we reset the password, I wanted to share the new password to the entire employee. It will be a tedious process. So all of a sudden our HR is going to, you know, change the password, then we are unaware of it, and we wanted to come up again with a new password. So this will be a tedious process. So we thought of why don't we create a single shared inbox, where we wrap the support email id into a single tool and we give access to the employees to that tool. So whenever someone is coming, I can just get their access that's it. The rest of them, they can continue with their inbox. So that is why I was exploring their product and I came to know about your one. Yours is hiver, right? Yeah, yeah, hiver and massive. Let me see if something is there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, massive.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Yeah, massive.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And do these people have their own individual Gmail accounts as well?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Yes, they have that as well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many email addresses you're looking to manage? Like you mentioned support is one and there are others as well?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  I'll tell you around there are 20 emails.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  20?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  20, correct. And.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  how many people do you have in each team?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Around six to seven?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Six to seven people?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Yeah, yeah. Say six. Got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It. So as you start implementing this, would you want to implement for all 20 teams that you have in the company? Or would you want to start with one or two and then progress, how are you planning to do this?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  That depends on your product. If the first thing is, the most important thing is I wanted to connect with three accounts, immediately, support relationship and dealer support relationship.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  dealer relationship and support?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. These are the three main inboxes that you want to start with, immediately, right?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Correct. Okay. And how many people go ahead? How.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  many people do we have in these teams collectively?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  As I said, on average, seven, seven, 1,421.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Cool. And is this the only reason that you're looking to sort of implement a tool like the password sharing in terms of the process that you are handling? Like everybody logging into the same account, picking these emails up and then handling. Usually, we keep hearing a lot of pain points in terms of not having proper visibility emails, getting missed duplicacy of work. And all of that, are these also some of your pain points or is it just the password sharing thing that is the main trigger for you to do this? The.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Main reason is that the visibility is not an issue because we are getting access to the single account, right? So I know that, what are the unread emails? And if some emails are related to my client, then I open that email and I respond to it, that's it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Then. Have you explored Google group option? Like turning these emails? I did.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Yeah, I did. But the problem is that, you know, I can receive the emails from external parties in Google inbox, but I mean, Google groups, but I cannot initiate external emails to, I mean, I cannot initiate external emails. So that is the problem.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can send emails from using the same group email address as well, but.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  I tried, you know, how that is possible? Because I'll do one thing I'll share. Yeah, one second, I'll share my screen and show you. So here as I'm sharing my screen.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  I hope my screen is visible to you, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, I cannot.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  One second.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Amen.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  How about now?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Now, I can see the screen.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Okay. So the thing is, so we were using, you know, cpanel, old godaddy, that email, default emails. And now we recently decided to switch to G suite. Okay? I'm in the process of migrating the account from cpanel to G suite. Now, what happened is that, see, I tested, I can receive emails if I initiate an email to support at pentad, in, I'm receiving those emails. But when I start conversations, I don't have an options to send. I'm only having, I can choose from my account, but I cannot choose to whom to send.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  To whom to send, you will have to put that email address, right? In the to section, there is no to section. So basically, this is a new conversation support itself. So when you are sending an email, this is going to the support inbox itself, right? You will be using your Gmail account in order to initiate any conversation, right? Whoever you don't have to send emails from here. So when you use Google groups, that does not mean that you have to come on this window. And then you manage these emails, how Google group actually works. Is you create an email address on a Google group? Let's say support at the rate is your Google group account, you add all the seven team members who needs to be part of that group. Now, what happens instead of everyone logging into the support inbox, and then, you know, working on those emails, these emails get distributed to everybody's individual Gmail accounts. So if someone writes at support at the rate that email will go or will get copied to everybody's inbox and individually, so that everybody will receive those emails and that's how they can pick those emails up. They can reply on those emails using the same support at the rate email address, or they can use their own email address as well. That's how it works. And if they want to initiate any conversation, they can always send an email through their Gmail account itself. You don't have to come here to send any email.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  mentioned.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  that currently, you're not fully on Gmail, like on Google workspace. Is it? Yeah.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  We set up the accounts but, you know, there are emails in my cpanels. Now, I'm in the process of exporting those emails to this gsport, okay? And importing those emails to here. Yeah, have.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  you gotten all the email addresses for the team and these generic 20 email addresses that you mentioned?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Yeah, which I've already done it. I've already created the users email, and now those group emails I'm yet to create. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So I would, if you have not created these group email addresses, I would suggest that you can create instead of creating a username and password with the support or relationship or any other email, just create these as Google groups and these are for free. They do not even Google doesn't charge for you to create Google groups anyway. So create a Google group. And I think that will resolve your problem of sharing password. You don't really have to purchase another tool to, you know, unless you have other pain points as well, which you mentioned, there are not right at this point. Thank.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  You so much Yukta. But the thing is that I was initiated, I mean, when I had this pain, I started with the Google groups and I was explore some solutions and I came to about Google groups and I created this supported pentad. You can see that supported pentad. There is no user accounts in this name supported pentad. And I've just created from here. But the problem, as I said, I don't I'm not fully aware of it. But when I'm trying to send an email which I'm receiving here, but those emails didn't come to my inbox. Have you added?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yourself as the user?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Yeah, I did see here. I have already added mine as user. Where was that?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you look at the members? Can you go to the members?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  So there?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is a warning sign next to each email?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  So,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think there is some setting that is missing and that is why you are not able to receive these emails.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Okay. Got it. Then. I will do one thing. I will explore that. I just, you know, as a new to groups, I thought that it is something like a slack where I can create different groups and, you know, I can have all the external and internal conversations from there itself.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that happened. Yeah. So once you create the group, you don't have to come here. All your emails go into everybody's individual inbox, whoever is part of that particular group, right? So that's how it works. Currently. I think it's not configured fully. So I think that you have to do, and once that is done, I think then if this works out for you, then you can do it. You can continue using Google groups only or otherwise you can use hyper because then I'm not sure about the cost and budget as well that you have in mind because currently you're migrating, you have just migrated from gpanel to G suite now, hybrid then will come at an additional cost, right? I can show you if you want, you can create shared inboxes and hybrid works on both whether you have a normal account with username and password or it's a Google group. For for hybrid, it does not matter, right? You just, so this support inbox that you have created in hybrid, you have chosen the group option, right? It's a Google group. Yeah. So you can, yeah. So you can create these inboxes then in hybrid. So the difference you will notice from Google group and hybrid is if you have a, Google group, like I said, distributes all the emails to everybody's, individual inbox, everybody will see those emails in their own inbox. And then they will pick those emails, work on it, mark the support in CC so that everyone knows at all times who has responded to. What with hybrid. There wouldn't be any confusion because then the, all the emails will come into one place itself. So then everyone who's part of the support inbox and hybrid, they can see this inbox right within their Gmail itself. And from here, if you click on the support inbox, you can unassign email, track the progress, see who is the owner of that email? What's this? What, what is the status on that email? And do everything to manage that particular inbox and likewise others as well.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Okay. So how is your solution different from missive?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Missive is a close competitor of ours… right? They also do the shared email address, shared mailbox solution. The difference that you would see is in the maturity of the product hybrid is a lot more cleaner, a lot simpler to understand. It sits right within your Gmail itself. So it helps you sort of be able to handle your personal account as well as manage your shared inboxes as well. We missive is, I think a team of… hiver is a, you know, more advanced. We have a team of about 300 employees working. We have a strong customer support. And in your case, since you require a lot of shared inboxes, the team is also large. I think the kind of support you would get is also going to be different. I mean, you would have, you can rely on the team at all times. So these are going to be the differences, main differences between missive and hiver. Have you already looked at missive or is this the first product?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  So these are the two products. I got it. So I think hiver I got from marketplace and missive is actually referred, my friend, one of my friends. And I just, there was one more product, I guess front. Com. So these are the product three products I finalized to use. Yeah… and how many. So, do you only handle emails or I can connect my whatsapp and everything to this hiver account? We?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Support whatsapp as well. What all channels you want. So.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Currently we are using, we have Instagram and we have Facebook and yeah, these are the two other channels. No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We don't do social media. So Instagram won't be possible. We only support email, whatsapp and live chat. Okay?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  And live chat is also you having, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right. Live chat is also available. You?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Got it. Okay. Social.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Media like important to you, is it a must have as well?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Yeah, it's, very important. We are receiving around 100 or 200 messages every day because… including the comments, okay, not only the messages, including the comments. So we are having some founders or influencers and they used to create videos and all. So when some videos are gone, there is going to be a discussions in the comment box. We receive all those comments and we review those comments and as well as we get message to messenger and Instagram and all. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So Instagram is also going to be a must have like, you need to have this channel as well. Definitely.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Yeah. We have around three Instagram accounts and three Facebook accounts. So we have a total of a six, this one, what is that? Social media channels like a three in Facebook? I mean, Facebook and three in Instagram. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So in that case, then hiver may not work out for you, right? Because we don't have social media, yes?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Let me see if there is any chance. Definitely, I'll try it. Your one. And just, I saw it and it looks very clean and neat. That's why I thought of take a trial and yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Also just curious like your role in the company. Are you handling the support team? Like what's your role? Okay?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  I was actually, this is my family business. Not one of, my relative is the founder of this company. So I am here in handling everything. I'm handling it and I'm handling the product and I'm also handling the marketing activities. Okay. Yeah. Got it. This is my phone got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It, no reason you can keep exploring the tool. Let me know in case you are interested in further evaluating it. In the meantime, you can explore Google group as well as one of the alternatives. And yeah, since now you also mentioned Instagram which we don't cover. So yeah, you may want to look at. So are you gonna like implement all the channels together? Like it, is it not going to be like you want to start with an email or are these other channels also are equally important to you? No?

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  It is equally important because I wanted to call, I will be, I said in a dedicated person to handle all the conversations. So I want, I don't want him to handle a different dashboard rather than that. I want him to pay, look only one dashboard and manage all the conversations. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. Then? No, yeah. Thank you so much for your time. And yeah, all the best, I hope, you know, finalize the right solution for you.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Take care. Bye.

Migdad Muhammed (migdad@pentad.in):
  Okay. Bye.
