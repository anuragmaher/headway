================================================================================

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Christina.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Hello? Can you hear me?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, I can. How are you?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Good. Sorry, I went to go heat up my meal and then I got pulled somewhere else. I'm so sorry.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, all good. All good. I appreciate you hopping on.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  No, I appreciate you doing this. The times for a lot of your demos are a little weird. I figured you guys are in different time zones, so this is good. So I appreciate this.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. And where are you based out of?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  We're in California?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I'm based out of New York.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But no, I appreciate you hopping on here, Christina. So just to set a quick agenda, I would love to do a round of introductions, understand your role, what got you interested in hiver?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Okay, perfect.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I can introduce myself first. So my name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the email management, customer experience space for a little over six years now working with companies like meta and Salesforce providing CX solutions. And yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can help you out.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Great. So, I'm the practice manager here for labryo, fertility. We've been around since the end of.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  We have a lot of shared inboxes for our staff. And, you know, we're a small team and for quite a while, it's been working with the general rule of thumb market unread now that we have so many hands in some of these inboxes and some of them are kind of time sensitive. We're looking for a tool that can help. We don't want to, we like the shared inbox right? Delegated access through Google because we use Google workspace. But emails are falling through their cracks now. So we're looking for something simple, right? We don't need anything too crazy. We're looking for something where, you know, like maybe certain things are said, they get assigned to a specific person, you know… or, you know, someone delegates them? But basically, we don't want emails to get lost is the long and the short of it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many different emails are you managing as an organization? And how many people are managing these emails?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Just me. Okay. I'm not the it person technically, so makes my head want to spin. So, in other words, I'm not a fan of managing this. So we have two inboxes that are currently shared. We are in the process of adding a third one. Yeah. So it's… just so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Are you the only one that will need access to a tool like hiver or are there other people who are also responding to these emails?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  So other people are responding to the emails, but I would be the only administrator in managing it, I guess, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And how many people are responding to the emails themselves that would need access to a tool like this… one two?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Actually, no, sorry. We have three shared inboxes because that department's about to grow.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  We're planning to add a fourth. Yeah. Okay. So that's actually more accurate. Sorry, I'm just thinking to myself. So then one, two three… I would need access to respond to emails, two, four, five… six, seven… seven. I guess.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Eight. Yeah. So let's say like, you know, eight to 10 like in that ballpark. Okay, that makes sense. And so you're going to have four total. Once you add the new mailbox, you'll have four total that you're managing as an organization.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Yeah. Okay. It's just, it's getting to the point where there's just, you know, people are, you know, it just, it happens with the growth of a team, right?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  So people aren't necessarily taking responsibility. Yeah, you know, they read an email or an email falls through the cracks and things aren't being answered in a functional manner, I'll be honest. I'm probably one of the worst culprits because I have like five inboxes. I have to check.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It's.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  ridiculous. And I mean, from my perspective is, if there's emails that are like going into other inboxes that mentioned my name and they could come to me that'd be great. Yeah. So I only have to check from one place. I don't know if hiver does that, but that's just a me problem. Not anyone else. I'm sorry, I'm going to eat lunch, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, no, no worries. And we actually do have a consolidated view that if you're assigned conversations from, you know, four mailboxes, you can see where all they are, but just kicking off the demonstration here Christina, you know, what's nice about hiver is we are a certified Google partner, right? We live within that. Google workspace takes about five minutes to get up and running one week to, you know, implement hiver from an automations SLA and reporting perspective, but everyone is going to log in with their normal Gmail login, right? And then on the left side is where those shared inboxes will live that you're managing as an organization. So, these are the mailboxes that I have in this demo, the customer success finance, healthcare, info, operations and support. For this example. Let's take a look at the support shared mailbox. So as I click into it, it's going to open up some sub views beneath the support mailbox that's going to help us manage the intake of communications. So, the first is the unassigned view, new emails that have hit the shared mailbox that need to be distributed manually or through automation. The next is mine, every email from the shared mailbox that's been assigned to me. And then there's the team view. So understanding Christina, what is everyone on your team currently working on in real time in this mailbox? What's outstanding, and what needs to be completed? Okay. Just want to pause here. Any questions so far?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Sorry, it's very hard to get my attention. Can you go back? Sorry. I think I wasn't understanding. So, so… let's say, so these are all the individual inboxes, they don't have to use the delegated access anymore. Am I understanding that correctly? Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's correct. So they'll log in and see how I'm logged into Cole at hiverhelpdesk. Com. So they're just going to log in with their normal work, personal email address and have access to the delegated mailbox mailboxes on the left hand side, got?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  It, so do I remove their delegated access or no?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, you can, that is not an issue at all.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Do I leave it or do I remove it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you can remove it? So once you hook up the mailbox, everyone will have visibility into these conversations on the left hand side for delegation and collaboration.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Sorry, I'm okay. Sorry, you, can, you have my attention? I ignore everyone else?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, going into the unassigned, right? The goal is to have unassigned zero, I'll click into this email. And as I do on the right hand side, a tab is going to open up where we can take some action around the.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Email, sorry, before you get sorry before you get in this, I just want to make sure like I understand. So like if I leave delegated access, is that going to affect how this works?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, it won't cause they don't need to be able to log into that email anymore once like hiver is going to mitigate that issue of needing them to have delegated access because we're bringing it into hiver.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Got it. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, the first thing we do is assign a conversation. In this case, I'll assign it to myself. The next way we can assign work is a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the emails as they come in. And then the next way is like skill based routing. So identifying keywords in the subject line, identifying keywords or phrases in the body of text, and then routing, you know, based on those key.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Identifiers. So let's use a real life example. One of the common things is patients will man… God. Sorry, I'm just, yeah, I don't even know how I even managed to spell this. Like, I really don't even know how I managed to even spell this. Like I wasn't even hold on. I gotta go to napkin. I took my computer.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no worries. No worries. Take your time.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  I was out of office for like 10 days. So yesterday was my birthday back. So things are a little crazy. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, no, no worries. No worries. I.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Guess maybe I'm just a little worn out here. Okay? So let me use, give you a real life example here. I don't know. I'm going to clean my keyboard. I don't have to turn off the computer without like typing 20 things. So one of the common things that we have is we have patients results, right? That they send in for their treatment. Now, sometimes it may be for a specific coordinator moving forward. It might be multiple coordinators, right? That may be able to handle it, say someone is out sick or something like that. So the reason why we have this shared inbox is like if someone's out, they can be assigned, like everyone can see it, right? So I'm from what I'm understanding with how hiver works is like if an email comes in there's obviously some kind of smart way AI or whatever that's like? Okay. So we're going to assign this to Jane and Sarah type of thing. So if Jane starts working on it, then it goes out of Sarah's inbox or does Sarah still see it or like how does that work?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So if they start like let's say, Sarah starts working on it, everyone can see everyone's conversations in the team view, including you Christina. So you can see what everyone's working on in real time once it gets assigned to them. So that's you know, that's the purpose of hiver to have everyone have insight into what's going on, who's been assigned what. And it makes it very easy for people to pick up with others left off. Got it.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Even if it's been only assigned to one person.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. If it's been assigned to one person, because right now we can do one to one assignment. Modeling. We do have the ability to assign to teams by using tags. So you can create, you know, teams based on tag types that are all customizable as well if you want to route it to like a queue or like a pod, for example.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  What if we don't even want it routed? What if we just want everything to come in and everyone has access?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then you can just route to the views. So if you just want to keep it into the unassigned section, you can keep it routed to the unassigned section and then you can manually distribute it. It's totally up to you.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Well, what if we don't want it necessarily even assigned?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So if you don't want it assigned, then it goes to the unassigned section, but at the end of the day, you want to ensure that someone's taking ownership of it, right? Like you want, like that's the way that no one's going to trip over each other's feet and both be responding to each other's email.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Okay. So in other words… if an email comes in, we can leave it unassigned, but you're… saying?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Sorry.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  So if we have them come in… we say to the team, hey, we don't assign them, but you, are they able to take ownership? I guess, is what I'm trying to ask?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, that is the assignment. The assignment is the ownership being like I'm owning this communication from here on out.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Got it. So once they take ownership of it… okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. And then they can track the status, right? Whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring we're working it, you know, through a resolution that nothing slips between the cracks, got it. Adding those tags. For organizational purposes, we can add these tags, leveraging AI. We can add these tags, leveraging automations, as well as just manually adding them, and then also tracking request types like drop down fields. So this is a customized drop down field I created that can organize the request type specifically. So let's say this is an NDA request and it will push it to that NDA queue for us to track and see what's going on with all those specific conversation types.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Is there a way? So for when you, so… this whole thread of conversation, right? I see you can do like link conversations there. If like this whole thread, is there a way to summarize the conversation or, you know, to print it or something?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you can summarize it. Yeah. So summarize it right here. I just hit the AI summarizer, which gives me the entire thread and then you can save it as a note if you want.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  How about like we want dates and times like of the emails? Like is there a way? Because normally the way, so the reason why I'm asking is we will document this in our emr system as well, right? So our communications get documented that way. So one of the ways we've been doing that is we'll hit forward and when you hit forward, it has all like the date, the time the email. But when we just copy that and we just put it in our emr system, does that make sense?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, the normal date and time will just pop up in Gmail, right? So, like showing here, it's like October 30 first 2025 644 PM.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Okay. So, is there no, because you can't copy that in. So like usually like if you hit forward and if you have an email?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, what specifically would you want to be copying the date and time for?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  So that we can put it into their chart to show that like the communication?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, you want to log when they've reached out to you into their chart into another system? Yeah. So that would just be a manual process that's not something we could automate today. You would just have to see, hey, they reached out this X amount of time to log into another system. I.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Understand that. But what, like do you mind doing me a favor? Can you hit forward for this email? Yeah… scroll down. Okay, perfect. As long as this doesn't get affected right there, cause the, what you see from the from date subject that's what we copy from. So then that's what we do. Do you see what I mean? Cause it's just so much easier instead of trying to find pieces, we found that we just hit forward. It gives you all the summary of everything that you need. And then they just copy the rest of the message. Does that make sense?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. And this, but this is all also living up on the top of the original message as well like forwarding this, for example, like you'll see October 30 first 2025 644. You still have this at the top of the message as.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Well, no, I know that, but it's not very easy to copy and paste.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah, it's.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  very inconvenient because then you have to pick each piece that you're copying. If you just go down here, like if this is like a written text email, they can just go, from the written text from the patient and boom just copy and paste it into our emr system.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. So, yeah, you still have that capability as?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Well, I just want to make sure that doesn't get taken away. So, is there a way besides the AI to do more of a summary then I guess is what I'm asking?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So AI is the best way to do that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So by hitting AI summarization that's how we do that today or you could use like our AI copilot on the right hand side to also summarize the conversation.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  And then,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  and you can copy and paste this from the summarization here. Okay?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  And then, are you guys hipaa compliant?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, we are. We're hipaa compliant. Happy to sign a baa. We work with a lot of healthcare companies across the world. And then we also do offer collaboration aspect, right? Christina. So being able to collaborate internally, I can send this notification to matt. He'll, receive the notification, you know, up top, he'll, then click on it. It'll take him to this thread where we can keep talking back and forth once we decide how we want to reply, we can, you know, but just by hitting the normal email reply, we have that ability to populate email templates for quick responses. Great. And then once we deem the conversation done, we can either send it pending, send it closed or send it closed and unassigned.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  And then their signature is automatically added because they're in their own inbox. So, because right now with delegated access, people have to change their yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So people can create their own signatures. So if you want, you know, to cater to like more of a personalized experience where it has their individual signatures, we can 100 percent have that. Okay. But what are your thoughts on this so far? Christina?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  It still seems a little bit too much for what we're looking for, we want simplicity.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So this is definitely like a, very easy tool especially for Gmail clients, Christina, because you're just logging into your already familiar environment and something to note as well. We do offer dedicated customer success managers. So they'll help you implement all this. They'll train the team to ensure a smooth transition. And I noticed you are the only one on the trial. So far. What I also do recommend is you adding other team members into the trial to get like a test run with the greater group.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  No, no, I'm not trying to be difficult. It's just, I don't have the most it savvy people. And then when you introduce something and it's only for a week, I have to deal with their complaints. Oh, I don't like this. I don't like that. No, no, no, sorry. I'm just, they give me headaches.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no worries. Definitely don't want to, you know, inundate the team want to make it as simple as possible. And I'm happy to provide a training session with them as possible if they want to see this as well. I mean.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  They would need to see it as in like they've been assigned stuff like they don't need to understand anything beyond that because, yeah, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then in terms of analytics, we can also see some good baselines like performance and workload analytics. So, let's say we want to take a look at the last 90 days here. We can see active new resolve conversations over that time period. What our average first response time was as a team, our average resolution time… individual performance metrics. So emails assigned per user emails sent out per user. And then those individual performance metrics like, hey, what was my average first response time over the last 90 days? And what was my average resolution?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Time. Yeah, we're not too concerned about that because sometimes things need to be respond quickly so, you know, they need to know how to prioritize for themselves. Yeah, I think that our only thing that we're just looking for is just to make sure, I mean, just to make sure all conversations are addressed.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, pretty much just like the management side of it, you're not really looking for analytics, you're not looking for anything along those lines, just strictly the management side of it.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Like if an email got opened by someone, right? So, I guess my only concern is if someone opens an email, right? And then they walk away or they forget about it. Does it still stay unassigned?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes. So, it only gets assigned to someone if a, they respond to it. So it'll automatically assign to them if they respond to it or if someone delegates it like this?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  So then if I see in the unassigned there's like 10 unresponded emails. Can I see who opened it and looked at it and left it be?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So no, you can see things like down low, like who's applied tags, who's responded? Who's been assigned stuff like that. But from opening emails, we're not able to track that today.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Because that's the other aspect that we're just kind of looking for it's like, so someone opens an email, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, instead of opened unopened, we treat like we have the similar mechanism, but it's for assigned unassigned.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Yeah. But the thing is because we're not looking to necessarily have someone assign it directly to them, right? Because it gets shared.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But wouldn't you want someone to be responding to the emails and like conversing with whoever reaches out.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  No. So, the thing that we're looking for is like, so something goes into unassigned, right? Or like basically comes into the inbox, the most notorious thing that we've seen people do is they'll open the email and then they'll be like this, right? And they just pretend like, oh, I didn't see it, right? Yeah, that's what we're one of the things that we're trying to do. So you're telling me is like if an email comes in, it will sit in the unassigned inbox until either I assign it to someone or I give people permission to assign or they take ownership of it, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It's either you're going to manually assign to someone or someone's going to manually assign to themselves or it's going to be a combination of our round Robin that will automatically do that for you and assign it amongst the team or?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Because the most common, a combination of skill base.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Yeah.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Because the most common excuse we get, oh, I didn't see that email where we know they've looked at it, right? But we just don't have the proof.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. And I think the round Robin will help because it's like it's pushing the work to the team and it's showing what's assigned to them. So it's like there's no excuses like, hey, you've been assigned this email. This has been in your workload the past 30 minutes and there's been no response. So that's how we do that. I.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Don't know if they'll like that. So, for, to summarize an email comes in, it goes into the shared inbox, it sits in unassigned. Either we utilize some smart rules to automatically assign it to people or we manually assign them or people take ownership of it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's correct? Either we create automations on the back end to just take that ownership off your plate. Christina. So you don't have to worry about it and then you can monitor it as it's happening or it's going to have to be manually done where you're distributing it, distributing the work or people are just going in and responding themselves. So it's either going to be, you know, an automated or a manual aspect depending.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  There is a way to assign multiple people, right? Not just one per email.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, that would be using our tags so you can create team pods using tags. So, you know, multiple people get alerted when something comes in… but I know we are coming up on time here Christina, I know the trial, you know, is running.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  So, what's the cost? Remind me again? Because that's going to be the other thing you said?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You needed four shared mailboxes, right?

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, for the cost, it's 45 dollars per user per month and we sell buckets of five. So five, 10, 15, 20 users. So for 10 users, it would be 450 dollars a month or on an annual basis, it would be actually you would need hipaa compliance as well. So it would actually be the elite plan which is 75 dollars per user per month. I forgot about the hipaa compliance. So for 10 users, it would be 750 a month or 9,000 annually.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  That's going to be a hard sell.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  there's so much stuff. There's so much stuff in there that we don't need. Like all we just want to do is just know who's opened an email and who's going to respond to it. We don't need any of the analytics. We don't even probably really want any of the automation rules that's a lot of features that we would just not use.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And, you know, we're able to get creative around that pricing for teams, that might not need additional functionality in that elite plan. The, the reason you won't move forward is because of pricing. If you deem this a fit for the team, we can work on that 100 percent.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Yeah. I'm going to tell you management is just not going to that pricing. No, they balked at 25 per user. So, because I'm just going to be honest, it's just because they're not too interested in the metrics they're not too interested in that. We just want a simple system to make sure that a given email gets open. It doesn't fall through the cracks type of thing. Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  OK, perfect. So I can send you this high level information after this Christina with our pricing page call, recording additional stuff that you can share internally. If there is interest, you know, get on another conversation. Do a team training, go over pricing? Happy to talk that through further. But it was great to connect with you today and I'm happy to be a resource as you keep evaluating our solution.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  OK, great. Thank you, Cole. Thanks.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Christina.

Christina Lam (christina.lam@labryofertility.com):
  Bye bye.
