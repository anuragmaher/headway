================================================================================

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on Clayton?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  We'll stop you in one second.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, how are you? What's going on?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  What's up, buddy?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I appreciate you hopping on the call here today, Clayton. So just to hop into it real quick and set an agenda for the call, I would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role. What got you interested in hiver? I did review some notes that my team sent me so I do have some background, but maybe just a quick summary on your side would be helpful. Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Sure. This is pretty straightforward. I'm migrating away from Hubspot, right? We're an airplane parts supplier.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  And what Hubspot does that I'm finding difficult to replicate is the shared inbox environment with some round Robin assignment. We don't use AI, we don't use knowledge based articles. We don't use AI for conversations. We can't automate responses to customers. This is a big E commerce business, but it's not normal. We don't upsell, downsell, cross sell, we don't black Friday sales. We don't coupon, we don't do any of that. It's hard to do demand generation because we sell airplane parts that are hyper specific, right? Right? You don't just buy it because you think it's pretty, you buy it because yours is broken… and it's hard to go break somebody's airplane to make them buy parts from us, right? Yeah… what we do differently in our industry is E commerce. Most people in our world, do not, they put parts on the shelf and wait for the phone to ring. Whereas we have more E commerce people than airplane people because our website is a pretty big deal. It's difficult to do what we do digitally. It's difficult because airplane parts make it difficult. The sheriff doesn't show up. If you put a Toyota part on your honda, but the fucking faa will show up if you put the wrong part on your airplane, you committed a tragedy, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, a lot of regulations, right?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  What we do well is airplane parts and customer service. And what I've been using Hubspot for is a big chunk of it is shared inboxing. I have a sales, you know, sales ad, email address comes to an inbox. Two people share that inbox on my sales team. It round Robin assigns the emails and, you know, you get the one you get and you work it and you move on to the next one, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  That's what I need to replicate. The problem I'm finding is that I've got five of those. Now, three of them are sales related. I could actually consolidate, but one of them is our purchasing inbox where somebody… on my finance team answers and responds to people that have an airplane or a parts inventory to sell to us. This is really the only place that any kind of templatizing becomes useful. We have some templated answers for things that we respond to quickly airplanes we don't want or something, right? We have some kind of canned responses for that. It's still manual. It doesn't go out automatically because somebody's got to look at it and decide that's not an airplane we want to buy. But then they can, you know, include a snippet that says, hey, we appreciate you whatever, blah blah, blah, right. Move on. Yeah, I found some other tools that do one Omni channel kind of inbox, but it just doesn't work the way I need it to, you want?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  To keep them separate, you want to separate every inbox in its own environment. So you're keeping the separation of church and state and all that stuff. Yeah.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Yeah. And certain people need access to certain things. Some people like myself and my sales manager need oversight. You know, we need to be able to see who has what.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 100 percent.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  100 percent. So we've used Freshdesk in the past and that's still not, we can go back to Freshdesk. I mean, it's kind of ticketing system worked the way it did, but it's expensive and I like it. And I like the way the Hubspot inbox works, and it looked like your system kind of worked the same way.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And just curious, what are you paying for Hubspot today? I think you mentioned it was a pricey solution. What is that per year?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Right now, it's about 40,000 a year, but we use other pieces of it. We have, we have that we have sales seats, we have service seats and we have marketing seats. So it's we're not using it just for the shared inbox. I.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Guess, I guess how much from a shared inbox perspective?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I mean, it manages those handful of email addresses that are a big, you know, a big input to our business. When we do a ton of email, you know, marketing on top of other stuff, you know, that generates an email from a customer. So, so it's… a lot I have like… we have some things set up for our returns, our refund process, but it's really not complicated. It's not nearly as complicated as it needs to be in Hubspot. You know, it creates a ticket. You got to close a ticket and it ain't that it ain't that hard. Yeah, but the forms are, you know, you submit a return form, you get an email. It tells you what to do after, you know, my returns manager has a, has some record of that, right? Like the CRM part of it is useful, but it's not worth 40,000 dollars a year. It was about 30 when we took it and it's just steadily gone up steadily, gone up. And now it's priced itself out and I'm at I'm 60 days from the end of my contract. And I don't want to renew. You got to find a shared inbox solution?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent and I think you came to the right place that's exactly what we help teams do.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Clint everything that you're looking for is what we have to offer here at hiver. But just to understand further, are you using Gmail or outlook from a company outlook today? Okay. Got it. Let me, just share my screen here and I'll show, you know, how we're working with some of the clients and helping them manage those shared inboxes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And it sounds like just from what I'm going to cover today, like you're just looking for something that's going to help you better track emails, ensuring that people are working through them as well as manage those five different shared mailboxes that you have as an organization.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Yeah, the round robinning is kind of a big deal in that sales inbox nowhere else. Does that really matter? But in the sales inbox, that's something that I kind of critical to us but.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And we have that as well, that's a feature that we have, if you'd like to enable. So, it's equally distributed and we can touch on that also.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Gotcha.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But taking a look at my screen here, Clint, you know, what's nice about hiver is we are built for teams that are heavy, heavily at leveraging email today within outlook. That's why we created this solution, teams that are managing shared inboxes, shared communications and you need better visibility, better collaboration, to ensure one, that things aren't slipping between the cracks and two that we just give it, give your team a lot better, collaborative aspects within those shared mailboxes that, you know, require that. But you'll log into this with your Microsoft sso, and you're gonna have access to a couple of different things on the left hand side here. The first is your personal inbox, so we can integrate your personal inbox for, you know, those personal communications from outlook, and then below the shared mailboxes. So, this is our HR, shared mailbox. This is our healthcare, shared mailbox. This is our sales and success mailbox. And the last one here is our customer support. Okay? Any questions so far?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Does, the personal side, does it work? More like outlook or part of the problem with Hubspot is, it doesn't really work well as an email client, right? The, the shared inbox that the sales stuff is going to, is okay. But… I, and I can't take like, you know, Jessica, on my sales team, I can't put her personal email in Hubspot. So she can also manage her emails from hubs from that also.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, this will give you the ability to manage it from here. And as you can see, we built, this is, I'm in my personal inbox now, Clint, as you can see, and it looks like an email client. So, I'm, just logged in. This is an email and I can hit reply. And then we have all that email client functionality.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Can you create folders and storage and things like that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can create templates, we can create, folders with tags so these tags can create different folders.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I see. Okay. So, you just, so you tag the email that's how you organize it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Okay. And then going to, the shared inboxes right below. So I'll click on the support one here for this example. So, when I click into this Clinton, it's going to open up some sub views beneath it that's going to help us manage the intake. The first is the mind view, everything that's been assigned to me, the unassigned section, everything that's hit this chair mailbox that needs to be distributed out. And then the team view. So this is where, hey, within this specific support mailbox, what is everyone owning and working on in real time? Clinton? This will give you that, you know, real time visibility to understand what's outstanding and what needs to be completed across the team.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  And those 16 people are just your team basically.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  This is, this is, yeah, this is, all signees. This is 16 conversations that are open across email that are being worked through currently.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  But the people in the list, are your people or those are people that sent you the email?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  These are my people. So, this would be, this would be your team that you're like, hey, what are they working on in the sales inbox? Okay. So this will give you that high level of visibility to understand what's being worked on, what's outstanding from your sales or purchasing team. So, let's go to the unassigned, right? I'll click into this email right here. And on the right hand side, a hiver tab is going to open up, on this email. That's going to help us track a couple of different things, right? First is assigning it. So, the first way we can assign is by manually doing it. The next way we can assign work from shared mailboxes is the way that you're looking for Clinton? Is that round Robin. So as the email comes in, we can equally distribute this amongst your sales team as well. And then we also do have the ability for like a skill based routing approach as the team scales. So, maybe, you know, there are certain specialists on the team that handle certain parts, requests, like things along those lines, we can identify those types of emails by creating an automation where it's like let's identify an email that has a keyword, in the body of text that relates to this specific part of a plane since it's you know, we've identified that this part is being requested about. Let's assign it to this specific sales specialist or something. Okay? Any questions on those assignments or views, how.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  broad is that logic?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For like, yeah, so it can be keywords or phrases, right? We can take a look at both of those in the subject line and in the body of text of the email. We can also take a look at like the domain of the email as well. You know, if it's coming from a certain client, let's route it to this specific person.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But, we can get pretty granular with that. What's nice is like with hiver, like you will have a dedicated customer success manager with us as well. And like, so we're not just going to sell you this and be like, good luck. Like we're going to like, you know, partner with you, implement this and create these workflows. And then we can track like the status, right? So, whether it's open pending or closed ensuring nothing slips between the cracks and that we're working through things to a resolution, adding those tags for organizational purposes. Great, really helpful for understanding, you know, what's coming over a certain period of time in analytics. And these also can be used to create folders for query types.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Any questions on the statuses or tags?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  No, no, that makes sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. And then the last thing here is the, you know, collaborative aspects. I'm going to send this certification to matt. So these notes will live on the right hand side of the email in perpetuity, you know, throughout the history of the conversation. So, I just sent matt a message over here to bring him to the conversation. He'll receive that notification on the left hand side here, Clint, and then he can click on that notification and it'll take him right to this thread where I have mentioned his name, and we can keep having that conversation, add attachments, whatever it might be as we decide how we want to respond.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then everything is timestamped and logged. So we can see who's been assigned this conversation, who's added certain tags? What's what's happened with it? Everything is timestamped and logged as an activity.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then going into the, you know, response of it, we do have that ability for templates. I know you mentioned like maybe in the purchasing inbox, there'll be a use case for this. We can populate quick responses with the template. Yeah. We can insert customer satisfaction surveys if you want to gauge client feedback, whatever that is. And then we also can do a shared draft. So, if you want to respond to a client but you want more information or to collaborate on that draft, you can share this with the team before you ship it out, with a certain quote request, whatever it might be.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Want to pause here, Clint, what are your thoughts on this so far though?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I mean, it looks like it looks like it solves my problem. A couple of questions, you know, let's say I have a handful of, like you have HR, healthcare sales and support. I imagine those are all, you know, it's HR at hiverhq, com or whatever, right? If you're not assigned, like let's say someone has your healthcare group, your shared inbox, but not your HR. Do they see the HR or is it just not show up for them?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  They won't even see it. So you will only see what your, which mailbox you're associated with. So, if I'm just a part of HR, I'll just see this and I won't see healthcare sales or support.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay. And then as an admin, I guess that probably weren't the same way, right? Like I would be whatever boxes I'm assigned to, but do I have any insights into, like if I was an admin, can I see your personal inbox or, is there a way to see that? Or is that gated to the user?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, not, so you can see what they're working on within the mailbox, the shared mailbox, right? So you'll be able to see what's been assigned to them from the sales or purchasing or HR mailbox, you have total visibility to that. Okay. You won't be able to see into their like personal work, email address inbox though.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  But the, but the personal is really a clone of outlook without.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Which, like I don't think you need access to, right? Cause that's just their personal communications, yeah.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  If they chose to use their outlook instead of that, does it sync or is it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it's a read write integration. So, what happens in here happens in outlook, what happens in outlook happens in here? It's a total sync.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then we do provide, would you be looking for any sort of analytics as well?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I, it don't hurt. I don't track a whole lot of that now. I mean, I can see it. I know where to go to find that, but it would be helpful to see, actually be helpful to see, some time data. You know, when did an email land? When did it get responded to? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For sure. So, let's take a look at the last 90 days of data, right? We'll take a look at the support mailbox. So here, we can see active new resolve conversations over that time period. You know, just understanding the volume, what our average first response time was as a team, our average resolution time as a group. So, just understanding how we're performing, are we providing a great experience, emails assigned per user, emails sent out per user. So understanding the workload distribution within that shared mailbox, who's working? What, who's doing the most? Is there unfair lead distribution happening? Which it wouldn't because the round Robin just things of that nature though?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Sure. One of the problems, one of the problems with Hubspot, and, these metrics is time, you know, we come into work in the morning like our office is open at seven 30, right? We walk in at seven 30. We might have orders and emails from six different countries, right? Right? And part of the problem with looking at how long are my people taking to respond to an email? Is it's really difficult to tell Hubspot that we're closed at midnight, right? Email hits at two o'clock in the morning. The clock is ticking. Does your system see that? Like does it recognize that my people are here from seven 30 to four? And if it comes in overnight, you know, it doesn't the clock doesn't really start ticking until seven 30 a. M. Is that a?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we can do what you call business hours. So you can create and manage business hours so that things are only being reported on with it then?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I see. Okay, that's helpful.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then a couple other analytics, right? We do have, the tag analytics actually, the user analytics are really helpful. So, understanding, you know, from an individual basis, what is the team's average first response and average resolution time? So, you know, how they're performing individually and… then tag. So understanding, you know, why, what are the hot topics our team is facing over the last 90 days? Why are people reaching out to the sales mailbox? What are the, like the parts requests we're getting most often? What are the sales requests we're getting most often and things of that nature?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then going to the admin panel, I know we are coming up on time here. This is where we can, you know, set up their shared mailboxes. So, you know, setting up the mailbox here, whether it's outlook, user accounts, shared mailbox distribution list, whatever it might be… and then going to that actual mailbox to, you know, add the members who have access the round Robin, auto assignments, equally distribute that those conversations, automations… for different purposes, right? So, this is one where it's like a billing automation where it's like, you know, new conversation comes in. We've identified in the subject line of the email, we contain the words, quote and billing, let's assign this to Rakesh our billing expert, and add the tag billing to organize it. And then the last thing here is the SLA policy. I think this could be helpful for, you know, your sales team for making sure things don't slip between the cracks. Yeah. So, essentially, we can create a sales SLA policy where if they don't respond to an email within a certain timeframe when it gets assigned to them, send you or someone else a notification. Yeah. So let's say new sales request comes in. We have a first response goal of an hour, and we want to resolve this in 72 hours. If we can't hit these metrics, choose who to notify to escalate that request.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Gotcha. Okay. So, what does this cost?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, for, and how many users would you need?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine right now, I'm at 10.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, we sell buckets of five. So, if we say five, 10, 15, 20. So if you start with 10, it would be, 450 for. Okay. So, 5,000, 400 dollars on an annual basis for 10 users.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Say it one more time, 5,000?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  5,000, 400 dollars on an annual basis, for 10 users,

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  If I want to take it month to month for 60 days or something, what is my monthly?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Monthly would be, 550 dollars per month. So, it's a 20 percent increase on the month to month contract. You can always go go to the annual for savings later if you'd like.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  And can you email me like, what plan that is or?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, so it, so it's the pro plan. So, it comes with, you know, up to five share mailboxes you can manage comes with, 20 of those rule based automations, and all those other, functionalities I showed, you know, the notes, the reporting analytics, templates, it comes with all that stuff I showed you and, I can share the pricing page as well after this with more details. But just curious, what, when would you be want? And if you started on, let's say the monthly Clinton, we will provide you with a, customer success manager too, to help implement all this. Okay? So, when would you want to be up and running with something like this? Does it seem like you want to move forward like sooner rather than later?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I need to do this now. I have 60, six days until my Hubspot contract expires. Yeah. So, you know, I need to pull the trigger on something and I've tried a couple solutions that were kind of pitched the same way, but don't really function that way.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I, I'm I mean, I gotta go. I don't want my Hubspot, to, I don't want to carry over my Hubspot?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Contract, right? So, you want to just get the team up and running. So, what if we did this? I could send you the monthly contract to kick this off ASAP. I can introduce you to the customer success manager who's going to, you know, implement this with you, so we can start with that transition.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I mean, that sounds good. What you send me a monthly contract is I'm assuming I can turn off the auto renew, and if it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Doesn't yeah. So, you just have to email, you can email me your support. So, if, at like 60 days, you know, you're like, hey, we're not gonna like keep doing this. We will essentially, just like, well, you won't, have to renew like you'll just work for that. So, we'll work with you.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay. Yeah, let me, let's send me that. I've done a lot of hunting and this looks like the solution. This looks like what I need but I just, I gotta try to break it to make sure it does what I.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. This is a very standard use case for us too, so we can treat these next, you know, two months of setting it up testing, setting up their shared mailboxes, training the team like this is very standard for us. And then, and… then, we can essentially just go from there.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Perfect. Thinking, send that over soon.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'll send over and so I'll send over the executable contract for 10 users on the monthly. Once you sign Clinton, I will introduce you to a customer success manager for us to kick all this off.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay. And just for clarity, this is not a big deal, but you don't none of this integrates with any social media, communications like Facebook messenger or anything like that. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Not not today. Okay. We're we're you know, that we will be building out channels in the future, but what we do really well is exactly like, you know, shared inbox management that's our bread and butter for apple clients.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Shoot that over to me. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And would, the same, would, what time tomorrow would work for you just to touch base? So I can, start with the introduction to the success manager.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I'm probably not in the office until about 10 o'clock Mountain Time tomorrow, good?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that's I can… do, let's… see… I can do one 30 est. So that would be, 11 30?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Yeah, that's fine.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, I'll shoot this over for one 30 tomorrow for the customer success kickoff? Awesome. So, I'll send you over that contract, right after this, we're looking forward to kicking off the partnership with you and, we will, we'll touch base tomorrow.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Perfect. Looking forward to it all.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Thanks Clayton.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Thanks, man. All.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Bye.
