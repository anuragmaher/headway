================================================================================

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Aiden. This is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, Matthew. Hey, Aiden, how you doing?

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Good. My apologies. I was in the zoom for my next meeting. I was like, I'm going to send this email. I wonder where he is. And then, no, no, no, I was in the wrong place. So my bad.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No problem. I have faith. I was just sitting here. I'm like I have a feeling he's going to show up.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Well, you got me. You got me. So essentially, honestly, we haven't done too much in this space, not something that was super top of mind, but saw the offer. And I was like, honestly, I'm loosely familiar with what you guys do. And it is an area where we could definitely use a little bit of help. So I'm not sure it might be a little bit early for us right now, but, you know, I think so I come from a customer success world and I think there's a big opportunity for us to do really well in terms of that. And I think that there's a lot of tools we could be using a little bit better right now. I don't think we're really using much at all. So as we start to think about that, just thought it would be worth having an exploratory conversation.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So got it. And are you guys a Google suite company or Microsoft suite?

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Google suite?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Google suite and you're not using Zendesk or any of those other help tools right now?

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Nope. Nothing right now. So, all of everything has really been through Hubspot, which is pretty rudimentary for a company as large as we are. We have about 100 clients right now.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. And then a couple more questions here. So really just wanted to spend the first minute or two just learning more. And then I can get into it totally. Yeah. And how about a shared email address? Is there like a support email that people reach out to? Okay. Yeah. So all.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  our clients get their own Zeni email. And so if they reach out to. So for example, if hiver was a client, it'd be like they'd have a hiver at Zeni AI and anybody on their team. So they get a controller and they also get a couple reps under them or not. Reps is the wrong way to put it, but bookkeeper other like financial folks in there as well as our customer success people.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Yeah. So either it's like a technical thing or more of a product thing or just wanting to talk through something, the right person can jump on it from there.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And is that like, that, that's particular email they use? Does it get routed to particular support people? Is that how it works? Okay? Interesting? Got it. Okay.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  But essentially, we're an agentic company. And so we're always really excited to learn about different agentic solutions for issues that we're not solving for, you know?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So just a little bit about hiver been around since 2017, over 200 employees, over 2000 customers across 50 countries with teams using our platform ranging from small businesses to some of the largest companies in the world, companies like capital one, openai, samsara, just to name a few across all different industries. And then, you know, a big reason that people come to us is mainly around these shared email addresses that they have.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Gotcha.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. So basically, what happens is companies come to us, either they're using something or they're not using something and they're like, hey, we got these shared addresses and it's really unclear to see who's handling these emails. We have to forward them, CC them to the right person. They have to manually route them to the right people. No unified view of past conversations have to switch between different platforms and no measurement of performance. So basically that's kind of where hiver kicks in. Gotcha. Yeah. And then there's AI components to it too so that we can help you respond faster, deflect a lot of these incoming inquiries provide consistent on brand communication and reduction kind of in manual effort.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Gotcha. One question I have right off the bat. Sorry to interrupt you, is there a way for internal tickets to be flagged? So, one of the things that one issue we had a couple of days ago was onboarding a new client and it was a lot of me going around to different people being like, hey, can you help with this? And I know it's this person, you know, and things like that. Could, it would also be able to route like internal help, absolutely. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It could be internal or external facing cool. And basically, yeah, hiver in a nutshell helps you do all this within Gmail. Helps you automate this busy work all without kind of switching a tool. So let me just go ahead and get into it now. Sure?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You see my screen? Yep. Awesome. So, so a big difference between a lot of these other platforms out there in hiver is that we're actually, we're certified Google partner. It's an extension. So, you'd simply nice.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Yeah, that makes things easy.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You simply download the extension. You'll see these icons up here on the right and you'll see these icons down here on the left.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  In the case that you didn't want the extension, we have a web application as well. Currently, it's only compatible with Microsoft, but it will also be compatible with Gmail too, but, you know, it's like 50 50 honestly, as far as if people prefer to work out of Gmail, when people do prefer it like it's usually really good like they love it. And then there's some people that are just like, I don't want to. So, that option would be there.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  The one thing I need, I would need to look into is a lot of our folks, on the finance front. So, the controllers and the people who are really owning the relationships they're on front, so they can be collaborative in terms of those, like messaging back and forth, but the support team itself is on Google. So, I would, I'm would there be any gap between, you know, cuz obviously front is gonna be a different system and it's still gonna be running through Google. They wouldn't be able to visualize all the, these pieces in that, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, the finance team. Yeah. Well, we wouldn't recommend the finance team use both front and hiver, But everybody else would be fine. Okay, cool. Yep. And, yeah, I mean, you know, for transparency, we, you know, hybers, I mean, front would be like a direct, competitor, to hiver.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  It, it would be in a way, but there's not as much of this like support routing and things. We can do it. It's helpful in the collaboration front and seeing where things are bucketed like this. But there's no, like, at least as far as I know, no way for us to be like, oh, they got this email. This goes to this person. It's still a lot of like, oh, I can at least tag somebody in here, and get the right person, but it's not like thinking about that for us, you know?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You're saying you're saying front doesn't do that.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  We can tag and like walk through things, but I can't be like, I can't like smart match like, as I don't know the right term for it, but like, hey, there's this issue, like, but from what it sounds like is depending on what the issue is, you guys will route it to the right support people to be able to help?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  With that. Yeah, yeah.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  That would still be like on front, where the limitation, is we're able to see and like have a conversation about the email before it even goes to the client. So, there's like a way to kind of chat through things before we respond and tag other people who might need to be aware of it. But the issue is it's not like routing things to the right person. So it's still the pain of like going in, copying and forwarding it, figuring out to the right person. So, competitor in this piece, sure. But I think that's like one thing you guys could lean on, in.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Sales or something interesting. Interesting. I'd be genuinely shocked if they couldn't if they couldn't do that, have you maybe try reaching out to them? Because that's pretty standard, in this space to be able to do. So, they might be able to, if you hit them up about that, especially cause, yeah, I mean, you know, as far as the space goes, we know, we kind of view front as fronts like the expense, the most expensive, but also the most like capable in this.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Space. Yeah. Okay. I'm obviously, I'm not on that team. I'm just the one kind of I'm the first vet in terms of these tools. So that came on before I was on board. So maybe that is there?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And there's also different packages to like the different things that these helped us. And even we have packages too. So you might be on a package that doesn't have that. But yeah, basically where hiver lands too on this, all this is that hiver is just hiver is also very powerful. We do the routing thing very well. But it's also easy to use. So that's the thing, you know, like people come to us and they're like, you know, we use Gmail, we have these emails and we need better ways to manage it. And we're not, we don't want to go buy a front. We don't want to go get a zen desk. We don't want these like, you know, expense expensive solutions. We just need something, you know, kind of middle of the road and that's really, where hiver is, gotcha. But basically, yes. So down here on the left, you'll see these folders and these folders are connected to those shared email addresses that you have. Right? So like, you know, we, you know, for instance, that one where you mentioned like we're different customers have different addresses for each person. We, that's a bit more complicated for us, but we can do it. We BA, we can basically set up mapping on the backend where it's basically like, if matt, you know, matt, email for anyone from hiver emails in, then it goes straight to Aiden.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Gotcha.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So we can set up customer mapping like that. But just to keep things simple and how I have it set up right now, you know, let's just pretend this was like support at hiver. Com. Every single time somebody emails that email, it's going to land here in the unassigned folder.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Gotcha.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And now, when you open these emails, you're going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can go ahead and assign it to people. They would get notified about it. There's statuses open pending closed. And there's tags so that you can categorize these emails. Now, with those three things here, they can all be automated. We have tons of different automations so that they automatically get sent to the right person. We have AI, which can automatically apply tags, which can then automatically go to people. We have automations based on domains like, for instance, where you said those, each customer has a specific domain. So we can set a mapping so that it goes to the right person. But yeah, a lot of different things we could do as far as those tags being applied, and then automating and going to the right person. And then down here is the notes section. This is kind of similar to something you mentioned too. You hit the add mention button down here. Everyone's name in hiver pops up and you can communicate with each other on this email.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Gotcha. That makes sense.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Everything's tracked. When the emails received, changes tags, et cetera, you can reply directly here within hiver, you can do email templates, for those kind of reoccurring emails, you might have AI chat, gpt, fix the grammar, make it more professional et cetera. Yep. And then also an AI co pilot, which can actually draft emails for you. Nice, it learns from your emails. Then it asks you a three prong question and then which prompt you choose it'll, draft it. It also can be contextual, it can reference things like a notion, articles, it can reference documents, and it can also reference a knowledge base.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  So, would it be able to reference like let's say I talked to the client like a month ago about this, and they bring up this issue. Again, would it be able to reference that past email thread?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Sick. That's cool. Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And, yeah, yep.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  No, go ahead. Go ahead. I'll save my question for after no.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Go for it.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  How, what's your guys' pricing model? Like, are you guys doing it like per ticket per seat? Like, how are you guys typically?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Per person, yeah, per person, gotcha. Yeah, per person that needs access to the system, our pricing's online. I'll email it to you as well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Cool. We have different packages obviously. The more expensive ones have more features, right? And they're all listed there. This is why this one's more expensive. And then there's also usage limits too. So it really just depends on how many people you want or, you know, basically growth's capped at 10 people. So if you have over 10 people, you're looking at pro or elite?

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Yeah, we'd probably have like 100 folks.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So you are definitely gonna be looking at pro or elite?

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Gotcha. And tip. So it sounds like this would be something where we would probably if we were to go with this, we would move moving off of front and kind of bringing everything onto here. I'd wanna have everything on everybody on one platform versus kind of be split, you know, what are the typical kind of pushback? Somebody who might be on front kind of give you like what is the challenges of kind of migrating that over? Or do people, you know, are people just like, oh, okay. Cool. Easy enough. Like, what is the switching pains there? And I know obviously you don't wanna give me a pushback to give you. But like I'm just trying to understand like what have other people kind of in my spot been thinking about or asking about? Yeah. And it seems cheaper and it seems like you guys can do pretty much everything we need.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So, I think that's really why people come over for front. I mean, it's a little different with each one but with front, it's basically that like basically come to us or they say, hey, we realize we're paying too much for front. We think we wanna just use something cheaper.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And, you know, these are the things that we need to do if you can do them. Then we're open to switching and, you know, once we determine if we can do them or not. So that's one thing you wanna, we wanna make sure that, we can still meet all your requirements, right? So, if there's things that you're doing in front, we wanna make sure, right? I would say that, no, I don't know off the top of my head some of them, but there are a couple of things that front can probably do that hybrid can't do yet. So there's that you wanna make sure it's a good fit. But if it was a good fit, it would just depend. It sounds like you only have a smaller team using front so far or is it a?

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Lot of people? Yeah, it's not the whole company. So we just have like a, very, like the team leads. And like the controllers are on front. It's not like all of our support people and that probably is a reason, or probably a byproduct of it just being a little bit pricier of a solution. Yeah, where, if there's if it's a situation, where, like, if, like, it's not broken, like we don't have any pain with it, right? But if we can save money and there's features that we're not that we're paying for on front that we're not really using or getting value off of and we could get everybody on this for like a similar price, would make sense, right? So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, then I'd say, I would say the biggest thing coming over from front would, is, won't be too big of issue for you, but it's basically, just like, you know, we have tons of people, tons of data on there. And yeah, it would just, it'll be, you know, not the easiest process to transfer over to hiver, but basically how we do it from coming from front, if you want the data from front to come into hiver, that's a possibility, you can export it and import it into hiver. But not everybody necessarily needs that data. You can just start fresh in hiver moving forward. And then also, you get, as far as the onboarding and stuff goes, hiver is fairly cool, fairly quick and easy just again. And depending, you know, 100 people, I don't know everyone's workflow, it depends on what we want to do. Yeah.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  And, it's also, a lot of that team is in India, so not all of it is in the U. S. So like W, like do you need everybody on a call for an onboarding? Can it be asynchronous? Where you just get our, like internal it folks and a couple of leaders on the call and then we can deploy the rest ourselves?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And we're very flexible with the onboarding, you'll get a dedicated onboarder here and yeah, whatever's best for you guys to meet and interesting enough, a lot of our teams in India too. So maybe the India hours could work out and we have 24 seven support. But yeah, not everybody needs to be included for the rollout. Again, it's a lot of it's contingent on, how complex you know, a lot of the setup's going to be, and how many people and things like that. But, no, as far as like you, since you only have a small team using front, it should be fairly straightforward and our team's quite flexible as far as, onboarding and hours and things like that?

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Cool. Okay. That sounds good. Is there anything else I should be thinking about? Or essentially what I'm going to do after this is, talk to our CRO, understand what we're spending with front, seeing, are we using all the features there? Just as we're thinking about 20 25 spend and what we're going to do in 20 26 tools wise, and budget wise?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Just a couple other things here. So, basically, like, and, and anybody on, in your company who has the shared email address could use, could benefit from hiver. So, I know that you guys, your customers are like accounting and things like that, but also for your accounting team. So, accounts, payable accounts, receivable, they could use, they could use hiver, HR teams, often use hiver as well. So like internal, like I was saying internally, right? Like when you like, do you have an HR email internally that you reach out to? Got it? So like, so they could benefit, from using a hiver. So basically, it could be the different departments support, et cetera, can all be set up here. And then, and then the team view here. So basically, for, each address, you can see all the open emails across your team. You can see which emails are late. You can see all the back and forwards here. And then we have quite a few integrations as well, which could be helpful.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, we have an open API. So if there's anything not listed here, then we can absolutely explore getting that connected as well. These are just the native integrations that we do have.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Sweet, no, Hubspot is the most important slack's most important. So that, that'll get us there. Good. Our support is on, Jira, mainly so that those all, I think that's all we would need. I don't think I would need the other kind of sales tool that we wouldn't need our revenue stuff or anything like that in here. The Hubspot connection would probably be able to handle any of that in terms of deals and matching anything like that. So, I feel like, from integration perspective, I think this is good. Thanks for showing me this cause I would, I would've had to ask you this question anyways later on once I remembered it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yep. Exactly. So, yep, Hubspot Jira, slack?

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  And is that quickbooks connection that works with quickbooks online, right? It's not like it's all the quickbooks tools will connect to that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes, cool.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  I've come up with a like, to, since we sell accounting stuff, we've had a lot of people say no, I'm on quickbooks online, and then we actually signed, we're like, oh, it's on desktop like we need, it didn't take us way long to move everything over. So, now, I'm just in the habit of asking that little glass question there. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, you know what? Now you're now, you're having me doubt it. I've never, well, I honestly have never.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  That's probably, it's probably quickbooks online and my accounting hat is taking me way too deep. So I would, I wouldn't worry. Well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'll tell you something like I've been here for almost a year, and yeah, I've signed up dozens of people with that quickbooks integration. I've never asked that follow up question and I've it's, never been a problem. So, but yeah, I'll most.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  I would say like, is you're probably mainly selling to like, you know, tech companies and larger companies as well. They're not gonna be on desktop. The desktop ones that we see are like home services, things like that aren't as necessarily as they wouldn't be the folks coming to you guys?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Well, actually, no, we do. We do sell quite a few, home service businesses, small businesses as well too. But yeah. And then the last thing I would just say before we jump off here, is the reporting so that's another big thing, right? You can select the mailbox, you wanna see, you select the timeframe could be custom could be last month. And you're gonna see things such as like how many emails? Like how many emails did we get reached out to last month? How many emails did we close out last month? And you can slice and dice this data however you want. You can slice it by person, you could do it by tags. So with those tags, you can say, okay, last month, we got 100 emails about billing issues last month. We got, you know, 40 emails asking for a cancellation request.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Gotcha. See. And, that stuff is really helpful cuz it helps us track like what are the trends that, you know, go hand in hand with that stuff too?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And then also it'll for like more of the support teams, you can see things like the workload across the team. Also, it measures… performance across people's, emails. How long is it taking people to resolve these emails? You can also include things like customer satisfaction surveys.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Do you guys run into like Planhat or tatango, or those larger customer success tools, as competitors? Or is this more a tool that could kind of go hand in hand with something like that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So this is, yeah, this is kind of separate really, you know, this is, like more of the help desk space and not necessarily like the customer success.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Gotcha. Would you, I feel like I didn't see it, but I wasn't thinking about this. Then you guys don't have like a Planhat or tatango connection or anything like that. No, gotcha.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But again, we have that we have that API, open to exploring it if.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  If it's not something that we have right now. It's just as we eventually build out our customer success functions more, we're gonna need to bring in a tool like that, right? And so, I'm just thinking like in the year after that, right? Like, would it be something that could work with a system like that? We have to pull it out? My thinking is, though, since you guys connect to Hubspot, and that's also pulling from Hubspot, that it would, the connection could probably be fine. There might be a wonky thing, but it's I'm like once again over complicating things. I'm just trying to think.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, sure. No, that's good. That's a good question. It's it's gonna get, I get quite a lot especially from like, you know, directors of support or VPS of support. They, they, they're thinking similar things. And then, yeah, custom reporting, of course, create custom views. Any, anything you want, slice and dice it, dashboards and all this is exportable as well. And then just lastly, I'd say the thing about hiver, not only is it affordable, you know, easy to use, but quite powerful. A lot of people really like us because of our 24 seven support. So, we have 24 seven support. You get a dedicated onboarder, someone's always available to either hop on a phone call with you or chat right there. So, a lot of resources.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Nice. Okay, awesome. Sweet.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And that's, that's pretty much it. I think that was good.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Awesome. Well, I appreciate it, man. I think it's one of those things where we're probably still a little bit ways out, but I think this opened me up that like if we are like overpaying for front and not using the full capabilities, they're making a switch could make sense? Okay? So, I'm glad we had that chat or this would have been something that I was thinking about like this is a six month out thing or year out thing, but it's like that's the case, there's a world in which we move by end of year. I have to have those conversations. So it's not like I'm saying we're gonna move super fast here, But I think you helped me understand that there could be more value today when I'm thinking about you as a front competitor versus, in addition to that stack.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, what I'll do is I'll just email everything to you today, please, if you can, yeah have those internal conversations. And then if it makes sense to reconnect here, maybe before the end of the year or anything like that, let me know. Otherwise, I'll just make a note to circle back maybe a little bit down the road.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Yeah, I'd say, so send me everything if you don't hear from me by like thanksgiving, I'll at least wanna like, I'm a sales Guy too. So I'd rather, at least just like give you an idea like, hey, is there a possibility this can happen or not? Or if it's like a, hey, this might happen or it's a six month thing or maybe I go talk to my boss. She's like, no, I love front to death. I'm never leaving, right? I just, I have to have that conversation and see from there. But typically, from what I'm seeing this could make a lot of sense for us.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Well, then, yeah, I'll keep it, keep an email out and just like you said, if you could let me know either way hugely appreciated.

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Yeah, no, there's not, there's nothing I hate more than an uncertain pipe, you know? So, if it's not anything there, I'll let you know, or if it's a, down the road, I'll shoot you straight. But if I don't if you don't hear from me by thanksgiving, just follow up with me and I'll reach out, but I'll probably have these conversations Monday Tuesday, my one on one with her. Okay, see if it makes sense.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. And I appreciate it. You got, this was from LinkedIn, right?

Aidan Lilani (aidan.lilani@zeni.ai):
  Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
