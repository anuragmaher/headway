================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  oh, oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Herman. How are you doing today?

Herman:
  You hear me?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hi, I can hear you. How's it going?

Herman:
  Yeah, very well. How about yourself?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm doing good. Thanks for checking in. Yeah, no problem. Hey, Herman. I'm going to be video off. I'm dealing with a little bit of bandwidth issues. So, hope that's okay. Yeah.

Herman:
  Yeah, no problem.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, pleasure meeting you. I'm Raghav, I'm with the account management team here at hiver. I've been with the hiver business for about eight years working across our gdm roles. And for today, I'm going to be your host and would love to talk to you about the feature functionality that you have access to. And also, you know, talk a little bit about the AI features if you're interested in that.

Herman:
  Yeah, very well. All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, to kick us off, Herman, could you tell me a little bit about what you do at salesup? And, you know, the kind of inboxes you're managing on hiver?

Herman:
  So, I'm actually the lead in the whole it given at salesup. So I manage, yeah, just from a, to, from everything I do the systems, I do the programs, I do the services… I do it all right. What we do in hiver is I just set up an it support mailbox so that… I can get if needed. If there are questions, I can get them in the it support inbox, but I also did the same for HR for workforce management. And that's about it. All right? That's why we use hiver?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Now, that makes sense. And Herman, what I'd also like to do, you know, like dive into, just so I get a better sense of how things work for the HR id support. And what is wfm, if you don't mind me asking?

Herman:
  Workforce management, workforce management. So workforce, yes, workforce management is, actually, do you don't know what workforce management is?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, I'm familiar. I just wanted to make sure that was the abbreviation for the term wfm. Yeah.

Herman:
  All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  right. Got. It. Makes sense. So, Herman, in terms of the way you're using hiver, right? With these three inboxes, I'm assuming all of these are emails from internal salesup employees in terms of workflows, in terms of automation, in terms of categories, what does that look like as of today?

Herman:
  So for HR and wfm, it's really simple. Just people can send a mail to for example, HR at salesup be, and then it comes in. There's no real workflow. There's no real tags. There are tags. But if I don't know if HR uses them, just, they, I told them that they had to… set up a meeting so that we can discuss it. But we didn't okay. And because of it, it's a little closer to me. Of course, what I do currently is I have some tags, just check… you know what? Let me share my screen, I.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Was just going to ask you for that. Thank you.

Herman:
  Okay. See my screen? Yeah. So just for your information, we are, yeah, we work in Google. So what we do is we receive mails but these are, these aren't really mails. These are forms that everyone has to fill in because, I had a yeah, from the first months we used hiver. All the information we got was really… not of quality. So we also, we always had to ask another 100 questions before we had the right information. So what we did is I made an incident form and a service request form where I put down questions, I really need same. And then they, with the automation, in the form they come in hiver… like this… and I have all the information. So what's from here on out happens is it's an incident, we mark the type of problem incident of service. And then I, these are the one I made. So yeah, the procedure is you'd first decide of which priority it is. Then if you are going to plan it or you're going to work on it. Got it. And then that's it. Then once it's resolved, you can, you know what I also, what you also always do is use the tag resolved and then close it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got. It. Makes sense. First question is how do you decide on the severity or the priority of this task?

Herman:
  It's more like for example here involved persons, they say multiple persons. If it's they have the possibility to say entire organization, multiple persons or only me. Okay. And that's yeah, we have to decide a little bit of ourselves. So if it's multiple person, I see it and let me just check this one. This is, yeah. So, so for example, this here, this is, she's talking about everything that's… cost driven for our clients. So she, this is wrong. She's only me. So I would put this as low.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it.

Herman:
  Yeah, that's it's a bit my our own decision. So here she can't log in. This is a, this is a, yeah, this is a priority high. It's not critical but it's high because she can't work. So we are losing money. You know what I mean?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So.

Herman:
  That's how we set, you know, use the priorities.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood. Got it. No, that makes sense. And, you know, after you classify the priority, you know, if it's something that's planned or, you know, if it's something that you're not doing right away within the id support inbox, how do you handle reminders and things like that on that? Like do you have a separate project management tool for checking these things? Okay? No.

Herman:
  Not really.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So let's say that I have something as planned for next month. Yeah. How do you track that just as of today with the tools you're using on hiver?

Herman:
  Just, yeah, use. So, yeah, I, my way of working in it is I set up a way of working using the eisenhower matrix. Do you know it?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, no, I'm not familiar with that.

Herman:
  Yeah. So it's this is actually the most important thing. This is important, not urgent. Yeah, important urgent, not urgent important. So based on the tasks here, I plan them, I plan everything that's incoming. I plan it. So, and then in my agenda, I use different, got it. Yeah, blocks, for the different tags.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Makes sense. Got it. So no, that's great. You know, the reason why I asked that question is because you know, there's a few of these options. A few of these reminders that you could pretty much have hiver, give you reminders about send you alerts, give you notifications, a bunch of things like that. Great from what you've told me, right? But yeah, let's continue. So once you file it a certain way and you start working on it that right away, what typically happens after that?

Herman:
  So, let's so let me just give me your example.

Herman:
  So, for example, this one is actually done because I did it last week… but let's just say I'm working on it, what I do is I put it in progress, I apply and then I start working on it. Once I'm done, I really finish this task, if you can, if I can finish it, then I do resolve apply and I close it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it.

Herman:
  That's what I do but feel free to, yeah, give us suggestions, better ways of working within hiver, because I think it's really needed that, we just change the approach of how we use hiver.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, definitely. So, just from what you've told me, you know, there's a couple of examples or suggestions that I can give you that will make things easier, right? The first thing is that you've got, you know, you've got these forms that people fill out and that comes in over here. Now, you can look at workflow automations just right out of the gate. And the reason that's going to be useful or that's going to be more easier for you to do with automation workflows is because your data is structured. So by the time somebody fills a form, you know, if it's option a, which is operations unit, what are the options that are there? If it's you know, business unit, you know, what are the options that are there? So, an example here would be saying the same example you told me which is, if it's multiple people and the business unit is sales, for example, then you need to by default classify it as, you know, potential high priority or market as something relevant. Now, the second thing you can automate is even more basic than that. So you've got the two dropdowns right? The type of problem, service request or incident request that can be just auto filled based on the title of the form right there, because you're getting it right there, it says it service request or it incident request and you can have an automation that says, hey, if it says service request, update the type of problem as service request and build on top of it, right?

Herman:
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Excuse me. So that's two examples that you can do like just using workflow automations without making any changes, right? Just based on what you have today. The other thing you can do is you can have a date based custom field, right? And that could act as your deadline tracker. I know you've got it on, you know, your calendar and everything, but you could effectively have a date based custom field on hiver. And just like the dropdown that you're updating manually, you can automate the dropdown and leave the date as something you update manually after you check the task, the scope of it, the level of work involved and all of that stuff.

Herman:
  Right. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So then that date based field could become, you know, a custom view based on this. So instead of just going by unassigned mind team pending and everything, you can have something and you can filter it once a week, be like, hey, is the due date end of November? And then you can just get a list of emails where that date is updated, right? Certain date. So that should give you more flexibility in terms of how you track these emails. The same would apply to HR as well. You know, when it comes to like payroll questions, they want to make sure they sort it out within the first week. That could be, you know, a date based field that you update filter based on that. There's a whole lot of things you can do. The other thing like those are the two primary suggestions just top of mind that I can give you that would reduce at least a couple of clicks for you. Now, when it comes to the priority of the work and the nature of the work, right? So, P1 P, two P3 and the type of inquiry, right? Both of those could be using AI tagging. You could make that being automatically applied. So you train the AI model with 10 examples of emails based on the criteria or based on the type of tag it should apply for. And because you'll be manually training the AI model, you can decide, hey, these are the 10 examples I want to give you that I would classify as high priority in it support. Then the model can learn based on it and it's you know, you can keep refining it whenever you feel that it needs to improve its scope. Basically, right? Yeah. So you've got that control that would make the tagging part of it less manual. And the more obviously, just like with any AI model, you know, the more you train it the better it gets and, you know, it's going to be perfect. So that's the second thing now, the third thing is when it comes to replies being sent out for these, it tickets, right? Yeah. What would you need to do to send out a reply? Like I saw an email with a bunch of screenshots going out in one case. So like what do you typically do there for a reply?

Herman:
  Oh, so what I typically do is, for example, this one, if I let's… just say those of the screenshots?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, for,

Herman:
  example here. And she has a question. She's she's asking something about our reporting to our clients, then the invoices we send out that is based on our data here. So I just ask her from like, is this, what is this, what you mean? Then she answers, yes, then we go for that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. And if we're looking at like a different example?

Herman:
  For a different example, let's say this one here?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Like this one? Yeah, I don't have access, I can't log in.

Herman:
  Yeah, that's it. And I forwarded it wow.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it.

Herman:
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It could be normal answers with screenshots without screenshots. Got it. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that makes sense. You know, the reason why I asked that question is again, this is a place where I think AI could help you by suggesting responses based on your business practices based on your it policies and things like that too, right? So look at it as two ways, right? AI tagging would basically help you train and get better at automatically identifying categories that are not reliant on keywords, keyword based is going to be direct automation workflows. If this word is in the body, add this custom field. If this word is in the subject, add the tag, right? So that would be step one, step two will be for anything that's more probabilistic, where you'll have to do a little bit of guesswork and the term is not the exact same word or phrase. You can use AI tagging. That gets a whole lot better. And because you're training it from scratch, it's not going to be like gemini where it just basically thinks every email is a category, right? So because you're training it because you give it that data heading in, it's going to be excuse me about as accurate as it gets when you kick it off. And then about a couple of weeks of tweaking it. And you should have a very clear model that's able to tag something with utmost accuracy as it goes. And then the third part of it just going by your workflow you described is that you want to send out a reply and that's where AI could then be the third step that will look at the email. Compare that with your process documentation with the knowledge base you upload to hiver. That way again, it's contextual, it's guardrailed within the stuff you give it and gives you a more detailed descriptive answer based on, that you can send out as a reply in one click. So that's how I three? I mean that's how I see a few of the hiver features kind of working together to make your experience better.

Herman:
  Yeah, I'm actually very interested in it also a few other features. But is it an idea for us to have another meeting with to just do the first setup together.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, I mean, we can do it right now. I've got us booked for like 45 minutes. So if you have time, we can quickly run through the setup and I can help you get that going.

Herman:
  That's the problem. I really don't have much time.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. No worries. Let's do one thing. Let's set up some time for next week. What is your schedule like?

Herman:
  So next week, I still have to schedule everything, but as long as I know it now, I can book it, I can save my spot.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Okay. So I usually cover you're in the Brussels time zone. Just give me a minute. Just give you some time. That makes sense. All right. So we're at 12 30 now, I think anytime from 12 30 to four or five P. M is usually good for me next week, Monday. I'm free from 12 30 till about seven P. M. So one 32 30 about three. So 12 30 to three. I'm free on Monday, Tuesday. I'm free from 12 30 to four, four 30 as well. Wednesday, 12 30 to four 30. Same for Thursday, 12 to four. And yeah. So what do you think?

Herman:
  Let's do it on Tuesday?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Let me just double check.

Herman:
  Yes, from 12 30 until, yeah, everything the time that's needed.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So.

Herman:
  It doesn't matter. I can, I… know I have stuff planned but I can't push it because I know it now, I can reschedule everything.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood. All right. Well, hey, thanks for being flexible. So let's do one thing. Let's do 12 30 to 115, 45 minutes. Like we were like we had for today. I'm going to send you an invite shortly for Tuesday, November eighteenth, 12 30 to, you know, 115, basically, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And we can chat and you can let me know what we primarily be doing on that call is we'll be doing two to three things. Right? One is automation setup or workflows, right? AI tagging and ask AI or co pilot as we're calling it for the category. And this one, I mean, the reply. And the third one I want to do is custom fields and automations based on that.

Herman:
  Okay. Can I add some stuff?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, please. Definitely.

Herman:
  So, what I would like to see done. Let's do it together is, so I saw that I want to fine tune the dashboards you guys have. Okay, and based on the tags that then we are going maybe going to make or that already exist. I would like to make a good dashboard so that I can, because my plus one. So my boss is the CEO and he frequently asks me, yeah, how are your slas, then I can just make a dashboard and show it to him… that's what I would like to see done. But also, I saw not long ago that there's a customer portal right now.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's yeah, that's correct, and that customer portal can be customized as well. So right now, if you scroll up, I'll just show you what's there right now. Can you scroll to the top? Yeah, click on form settings?

Herman:
  Yeah. So that's what I did.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You've done that. Okay? Cool.

Herman:
  But there are a few things that I would like to add and that there, I know that there were a few things that I would like to add but I couldn't so let me just think about it. I'll just note everything down so that maybe I'll send you tonight, everything I would like to see. But also, I think the most important thing is… so the forms that I would like it to only be a certain few people that can access it. So that's probably with configure request visibility, this thing I can. But what I would also like to see is, so for example… if it's not possible, you have to tell me.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Tell me.

Herman:
  But so not long ago, I think this is a new feature you guys added that you can see all the requests that were done. I would like to see some tags here, some extra things… but I would also like to see the name of who was assigned to.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Herman:
  And maybe, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So the tags and the names, I don't think those are on the roadmap at least for right now. And the reason they're not showing up is more from a privacy standpoint as it is today. So both of this would be feature requests that go back to my team.

Herman:
  Right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. Very good. And then maybe if possible, so for example, there are not a lot of people that are, that… have the option to make a request to it. So we also, we only do the team leads the managers and the CEOS, okay? Just to just to have, yeah, because we are, we work with a lot of people. So that's our inboxes are not full of just not good requests. So that these are, they are our first filter. Okay? And then they come in, it would like, it would be nice to see here. How many open requests there are incident service, the ones they are working on just to have like the dashboard, we are going to fine tune and make, it would be nice to see it here because if I remember if there is a dashboard, so let me just go to analytics.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, we do have dashboards right at the top.

Herman:
  Here. So I made a few but I just have some questions about it. Yeah, it would be nice to this to have this live as this. So that, yeah, my, you know, my boss can see this all the time.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. All right. So the one thing I will tell you is again dashboards is not something we will be showing within a customer portal only because, you know, the general intention with which we've built the customer portal, you see is that it's going to be for external facing parties like not the team that's on hiver, but for the people that want to drop in the request to that team, right? So, and that's you know, one of the primary reasons why we might not have a dashboard so far that you can have on the portal, what I'd recommend is more having your manager on hiver so that they can use the analytics like you are to look at everything and look at the customer portal purely as a place of tracking, what are the requests? Have they been picked up? And what's the status of completion, right? Just more from that filtering perspective would be there you go, right? So who's handled it? How many tickets were closed in the last one week? So that will be the right method of looking at the customer portal experience. And then for any detailed reporting clarity on information, things like that, it will make sense to just have your boss on hiver and have them use the dashboards instead.

Herman:
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Herman:
  Yeah. That's very clear then. Yeah, just maybe here, can the data be, that is behind this? Be reset it? Because there was a time that we used hiver, we bought hiver, but we didn't really use it. So, yeah, there were a few resolution times because of those ones that this is so high.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. I mean, the easiest way to do that is just to click on the top, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Go back to dashboards, click on the top, right? Just here. Yeah. And then just like selected for shorted date range like you'll know probably from when you started using hiver, right?

Herman:
  Yeah, that's right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So that way for the time being that'll be good. And then like over the next two, three weeks with regular hiver usage, the numbers will just reset. And if you do have any outliers, you know, one or two emails that are still messing up the numbers, then I can just have my team exclude those from the backend?

Herman:
  Right. Very well.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Herman:
  Yeah, very good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. A couple of other things as well. I want to inform you about now that, you know, we've been talking about this is that the first thing is the custom dashboards that you were just showing me that's part of the next plan tier. It's not on your current tier. So, I just wanted to mention that if we continue using it, there will be an upgrade to the pro plan required for the whole subscription. And I wanted to like make sure you're aware of that and that's going to be under admin panel. Yeah. So, oh, nevermind admin panel. Yeah. Oh.

Herman:
  No.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Settings at the very bottom. And then, yeah. So you're currently on the growth plan, it's at ust per person per month. I think you've got a small discount nope on the list price. Yeah. So that's the, this immediate plan that you're on it's called the growth. The next plan will be the pro plan and that's at ust per person per month, right? And what I can see in the backend, is the annual rate. If you scroll to the top or bottom, you should have the monthly, yeah, there you go. Yeah. So that's the rate for the monthly and the annual version, and that will be the next plan. Yeah, that will be rated for like custom dashboards, more slas, number of automation rules and things like that. So, what I do is, here's the pricing page for comparison, just going to drop it on zoom chat, right? So you can use that and it has like a full breakdown feature, one, feature, two, feature three, what plan level is it supported on? How many of it is supported? All of that data?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Wait, can you move the one at the bottom? Like you're good. Let's just click on that. And there we go. So, if you scroll down just a bit more, you have like a full matrix breakdown of the whole thing, view all features. Oh, no. Can you go up? Yeah, that one then. So that's your full matrix breakdown level by level of what's available on which plan?

Herman:
  Nice.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So yeah, I should give you an idea of things. Yeah. And the last one is that the AI feature as a whole, the entire suite is at 20 usd per person per month. That's list price. And I saw that you only have three days left on your trial. So, you know, what I'll do is if you're interested, I can have like a discounted price sent over in terms of a quote for the bundle of pro and AI because you need dashboards, you would effectively be needing to upgrade as well. And, if you think we can have it confirmed by or before Monday, I can have like a couple of days extension or maybe Tuesday considering we're meeting on Tuesday.

Herman:
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Do you think it makes sense for me to check for like discounted options and send it over?

Herman:
  Yeah, yes, indeed. Because we are going to add a few people. So we have to for sure go to the pro to… the pro subscription. But if you can do something there, that will be nice. But also for the AI automation that, let me just check with my boss if he really thinks that it's needed.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it.

Herman:
  Just to not, yeah, rack up, some not necessary costs… and then I'll come back to you. But if it would be nice that if we can set it up, got it. Have my boss see it a few days, two or three days and then the decision should be made, is it, is that an option so that we can Tuesday, we can set it up, extend it a few days, maybe until Friday? Let me show him very clear what is happening and then afterwards make the decision or is that not possible?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I mean, I can definitely check with my team and have a bit of a trial extended, but it will be a hard cut off on Friday next week. So that's fine. You know, I can definitely have that extended. I'll work with my team and have the trial extended for your account accordingly. Yeah.

Herman:
  Okay. Yeah. But because I just don't do not want to make him, yeah, false promises, but I think it's better if he sees it that it works well, then he can make the decision for sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. All right. No, that's good to go. So, Herman, what I'll do is I'll send you some help articles, things like that on the AI features as well. I'll include the pricing page comparison. I've sent you the meeting invite just now, so we'll talk on Tuesday. Any questions before Tuesday? Just drop me an email and we'll take it from there. Yeah, very well, cheers, Herman. Thanks for meeting, take care man. Thank you.

Herman:
  Bye.
