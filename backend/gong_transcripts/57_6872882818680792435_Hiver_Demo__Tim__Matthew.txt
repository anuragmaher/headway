Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Tim, this is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Yeah, I can hear you. Sorry, matt. I just had an emergency with a team member. So, sorry for my delay. No.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No problem at all. I had this half hour blocked off for you. So, no problem.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Thanks.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And just the agenda for the call. Just wanted to spend the first couple minutes getting an understanding of what you're looking for, helping you determine if hiver can fit your needs. And then from there, I can walk through the product and answer some questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Yeah, no good. Perfect. So basically, we are a real estate company here in Australia and we're looking for, basically, well, we have already a shared email account or for all our email accounts, we have shared ones, but we use them just via outlook and we're getting more and more team members now and also have now, well, we have soon some in the Philippines working for us as well. And it starts getting messy. So basically, yeah, we wanted a little bit of structure than just having, you know, one outlook account, and then 10 people work there. I have no record of who is doing what, and it just starts everything a little gets all a bit messy at the moment. So, yeah, we were looking for a system that could help us in that sense.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Absolutely. That's exactly what hiver does. This is the main reason that people come to us is they are just looking for a better way to manage these shared email addresses and to get visibility into what everybody's doing. So that's exactly what hiver does. So great. Awesome. So this is my screen here. Can you see it?

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Yeah, I can.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So it's a web application, right? So it's a website, you go to, you're. Just going to log in using your Microsoft credentials and then you're going to see a screen like this. And then on the left hand side here, you're going to see these folders and these folders are connected to those shared emails that you have. Now, how many of those shared emails do you have? Is it just one? Is it three?

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Let me count. I think it's four, four shared. Yeah. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then about how many people would need access to this?

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  At this stage six, but probably eight at some point like by the beginning of next year probably. So let's say six for now?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. No problem. Perfect. So basically, what you would do is you would set up these folders and each folder is tied to a different shared email address that you have.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then how it works is whenever somebody emails that address or just look at support here, this is support at hiver, com et cetera. Whenever somebody emails it, it's going to land in the unassigned folder to start. And then once it lands in the, let me grab it for one of the email here. I don't like these ones. Let me see this one. But basically, so somebody emails it, it's going to land here. When you open the emails in hiver, you're now going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, what you can do is you can assign it to each other.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That way, you know, who's responsible for this email.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Then we have statuses open pending closed. So this will let you know like what emails still need action, which ones have been closed out, et cetera. And then there's also tags which can help you categorize these emails that are coming in?

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then there's these custom fields down here. These are custom. They can be selections… text fields, anything custom you're looking to track. And then also here's, a notes section. This is where you can put notes or you hit the add mention button. Everyone's name in the account pops up and you can be like, hey, Cole, can you help on this email? And then Cole here would get notified that we've mentioned him to help on this email.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. You can also reply directly in here to these emails so that's the other benefit of hiver is that once these shared inboxes are connected, everybody can see the back and forwards. Okay. Yep. So you're no longer gonna have to like CC each other forward emails or anything like that. It's all gonna be here so everybody can see you could set up templates for those kind of reoccurring emails that you might get. We also have some AI features such as AI chat gpt, and then we have an AI feature which can actually draft replies for you. The AI stuff is an add on. I can go over that at the end of the call, but just keep that in mind. It basically learns from the emails that you're getting it'll ask you a prompt and then it will write a response for you. Okay. But yeah, let me pause there. So far? Any questions about the folders? How they're connected and how that works out?

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  No, that makes all sense. Just in terms of like how about the signage… when you send an email? Like, for example, we have a shared PM folder for property managers. So they're like two or three different people actually having all the same email. But let's say, for example, person a needs to sign with Tim, person B needs to sign with John when they talk to their clients. Is there a way to always have the signature at the bottom as well automated depending on who is writing the email?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Yes. Okay. Exactly. Yep. In the settings, you can choose the signatures, each person?

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay, perfect. And yeah, just… okay. So can you go back just one sec?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Yeah, that makes all sense. I just wanted to have a look at the interface and do… you have as well a system to potentially automate like text messages sent as well at the same time? Or is it just email? I didn't check that. I just wanted to.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's just email. So we have systems that can set up automated emails, But yeah, it's just emails. There's, no text messaging.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay. No, that's all good. Yep. Just thought I'd ask.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. And I was going to say this is the team view. So basically, in each folder, there's other views. This one's the team view. This one's really helpful because this one's going to allow you to say, okay, this will show you all the open emails across that address and who's working on them. So we have open emails here. I can see that Jeevan has two of them, right? Matt has two of them, Cole has one? So this is going to let you see at all times what your teammates are working on.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay. And for me now, is it as well possible to just see the performance, let's say of Cole miller. Would I have any information on how many emails will he send? Do you have any stats for me as a manager basically, because the bigger the team gets, we will have offshore team members as well. Perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yep. We got analytics. You select the address that you want to see. You then select the timeframe you want to see. So it could be a custom date. It could be last 30 days, last 90 days et cetera. And what you're going to see is you can slice and dice this however you want, but real easily, yes, you're going to see how many emails have been assigned to each person in that timeframe. You're also going to be able to see how many emails they've sent out. And you're also going to be able to see each person's average response times, average resolution times. So like how long is it taking them to respond to emails and how long is it taking them to resolve them?

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  What is the csat status?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That's a customer satisfaction survey. So that's another thing you can set up with hiver is where at the bottom of these emails it can send out like a customer satisfaction survey and they can, you know, rate it and provide feedback if you wanted to do that. Yeah, it's optional.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Yeah. Probably it's not needed with this one. I mean, in property management, probably the team would get abused anyway. So don't need that at this stage. Yeah, just, yeah, if you can share me now, the pricing and everything because I mean, or do you have any other features, what I should be aware of?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I would say one other thing that's quite popular is setting up these slas, which is basically you'll see these red lightning bolts here. So what they could do and you can have them different for each address that you have. But it's basically like if nobody, you can set it up. So like if nobody responds to an email within two hours or whatever you say, then it will notify you that email is late.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you could, yeah. So you can just easily see in that view there, you can get notifications which emails are late.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Awesome. No, that's pretty good. Cool. Yep. And in terms of the AI, what you had there, the AI system, you basically, it just drafts all the emails for you or like you can have it automatically responding as well at some stage.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So the automatic responses isn't there yet, but right now, yeah. Yeah. Right now, it's just the draft. So that's the main thing. Yeah, it can just draft replies for you. So, the three AI features that we have in our outlook product is the AI chat, gpt, the ability to draft a reply. And the third one is called an AI summarizer, where it actually can summarize a thread of emails for you as well.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay. And do I have it all? Can I also store all the emails there? Or like let's say if one tenant of ours would write to me over two or three years, would I have all the communications saved in that in hiver as well? Or would I have to go back to outlook and check for past emails of this person?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it'll be saved in both places.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Oh, okay. Perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. And hiver doesn't you know, delete anything from your, from the outlook side too. So you'll always have everything in the outlook side, whether you decide to add your service with hiver or anything like that.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay. And do you have an integration with Monday com as well or is it possible to have an integration with it just because, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you have Monday com there?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Oh, there it is. Yep.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay. That's all good. Yep. Okay. So basically, I could have as well like once an email is sent in hiver over at hiver, I could basically update as well a board in Monday. Com. Is that potentially possible?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes, I believe. So, let me just double check here real quick. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Is set up on this one? Let me just see here. Is that what it says in there? Where's the apps, Monday… get workspaces, get boards, create an item. Yeah, it looks like you can create an item from here. Okay. Yep. So add update.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Not necessarily, but not necessarily write a comment or something. It doesn't look like.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'd have to double check on that one.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Yeah, that's fine.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'll double check on that one, but yeah, it is there. It is possible.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay. Cool. Yep. And.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  as far as our pricing goes, it's all on our website. I'll email everything to you as well. We have a couple different versions here, growth pro and elite you do not need.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Elite. This is for like, you know, the fortune 500 companies that we talked to. Yep. So you're really looking at growth and pro. The main thing here is a couple key differences. The reason pro is more money is because it has more features, but also there are usage limits to the growth. And one of the ones that, you know… makes people not makes people but is a reason they have to sign up for pro in your situation, is the limitation. So with growth, you can only connect up to three of those shared addresses. So if you have more than that, pro allows you to have up to five.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay, cool. Yep. That's fine.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Awesome. Exactly. And then we have an annual one if you pay for the year up front, and then we also have a month to month version as well.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then lastly, I know you don't have the exact number here. I can work with you on pricing a bit here. We do sell in buckets of five.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Right. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And it looks like, you know, you have like you're in the 10 user bucket and it looks like you're going to add some people to it as well. So, yeah, I know you're going to have eight people eventually. So yeah, if you move forward with the 10 user pro, I'm happy to extend you a 20 percent discount. So basically, you'd be paying for eight users, but you get accessed up to 10.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay. No worries. Awesome. I just wrote down some notes but, yeah, can you please send me as well the pricing… and everything? I mean, yeah, or any information what you have for me because I need to discuss it with the team in the next couple days as well. But so far, yeah, all looks good to me absolutely.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we also have one other thing that makes us different too is, I know you're in Australia, we do have 24 seven support. So we have customers in over 50 countries. And if you look at the online reviews, you know, the two main reasons people choose hiver is really just ease of use, right? It's fairly simple, but it's also quite powerful. We do have some of the largest companies in the world using us capital one openai, just to name a few. But the other thing is that we offer 24 seven support. So there's always somebody you can chat with here and they'd also be able to get on the phone with you if you were having any other issues like that. And then additionally, I'll put this in the email for 10 users pro, you would get onboarding and setup included in that as well. Okay. Yep. Cool.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  No worries. How long would the onboarding take to set everything up?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Not long for a team of 10, maybe… like two 30 minute sessions.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Oh, okay. So nothing really. So that's good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Cool.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  The price is obviously in us dollars, I assume.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yep.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Yep. Perfect. Awesome. Cool. Yeah, thanks Matthew for your time and apologies for being so light. Yeah. If you can send me just another email with all the information, then I just discuss it with the team and then I will come back to you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Will we be able to just put like maybe a follow up call maybe… like a week from today same time?

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Or just send me an email to be honest, like honestly at the moment, we're quite busy. So if you send me a follow up email, then I just get prompted to do it, but I was going to chat tomorrow anyways. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  So probably early next week, I would assume that I have an answer for you if not just prompt me via email quickly. And then I, yeah… okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no problem. Tim. Well, I'll email you everything. Thanks again. For your time and I'll look out for an email next week.

Tim Oldenburg (tim-o@handbrealestate.com.au):
  Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks. Bye bye.
