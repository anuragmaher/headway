================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  just.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  a quick update. We'll be meeting Maria, the manager for the first time. She may have some questions on hiver and the AI feature set as well. We'll talk about it. We've given them an extension until the twentieth of November so that they can further review it. I'll walk them through hiver and maybe the AI features again for Maria, if she has some questions about it or anything of that sort in terms of pricing.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  You definitely feel free to pitch in if at all we want to go that route right now or maybe on the twentieth of November… which one AI pricing?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  AI pricing, cool, mama, so far? What's our expectation that we set for the pricing of these guys?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I've told them that it's at 20 dollars per user per month by my standard pay. But since you're an existing customer, we are open to negotiate on the pricing. I have not given them any number as such.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. Makes sense. So, as per the October fourteenth email, nothing has changed since then, right?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  No, no, nothing has changed since.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Then. Good to know. Let's go.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Alright, cool.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Why did you kick out my fathom bro?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  It'll come back. It'll come back?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  But mine is gone. So we'll keep going to that.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Hi, Dario.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  How are you?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  I'm doing good. How are you doing?

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Yeah, me too. It's finally Thursday and then it's Friday.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can totally relate. I'm counting days as well until the weekend. Yeah. Do you have some plans for the weekend or?

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Like honestly say no, but do you know, like we already have a real Autumn there in Bratislava? Like it's not already this sunny Autumn with beautiful views and trees. It's already like something in between of the winter and Autumn and it's like cold awful weather. So it's just exactly just to stay at home and watch the series for the whole day.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  That's the best plan ever. Yeah, awesome. I will.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Maybe bring a note to Maria. Isha… okay.

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Okay. Sorry, I didn't have zoom yet. So I had to install it.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Hey, that's absolutely fine. Hey Maria, pleasure to meet you. Dario did give me a heads up that you'd be joining the team and you've joined. I think it's been a couple of weeks since you've joined the team and you've had the opportunity to look at hiver in that short period, right? But I think before we get into that, I'd like to start with a quick round of introductions. I'm cleander. I'm the customer success manager for secret escapes. I've been working with Dario and her team for almost over a year now. So pleasure to meet you. I also have my colleague Raghav on the call who's the account manager. I'm just going to pass it over to him to introduce himself.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hey, Leander. Thanks for that. Hey folks. I think it's probably the first time, definitely the first time I'm meeting you, Maria, Dario. I think we might have met once before. I'm not sure anyways. I'm Raghav, as Leander said, I'm with the account management team here at hiver. I've been with the hiver business for about eight years. Now, it's pretty much worked across all of our GTM motions. And yeah, consider me an added resource to Leander. As you continue using hiver, I'll be playing more of an active role when it comes to growing your footprint, understanding your commercials, establishing better pricing levers and things like that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Leander is going to continue being your primary point of contact till then. So pleasure meeting both of you. I'm going to hand it back to Leander.

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Nice to meet you. So maybe I'll also just make a very short intro. I'm here since one week I joined as head of rewards and people services. I'm very excited for future cooperation, but I'm still trying to get my grip around what is going on as I joined on Thursday. So very nice to meet you guys.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome pleasure to meet you as well. So, yeah, the agenda of this meeting was mainly to discuss hiver if you have any questions around hiver and also the AI features that's something we have been in conversation with Daria over the past couple of weeks.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Essentially, this is one of our new offerings that we have in addition to your existing hiver package. And yeah, besides that, is there anything else you'd like to add to, you know, to the agenda of this meeting, anything specific that you'd like me to go over?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  I have some questions. So I've never worked with hiver. So I work with different tools. So I'm not 100 percent familiar but definitely wanted to also check with the AI opportunities for chatbots. And if you provide something which is like more customer entered, yeah, so excited to see what you have mentioned about AI.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Glad to hear that. Glad to hear that. So just to give you an overview, your team currently uses hiver for the HR at secretescapes. Com, shared mailbox. Essentially, this is a central space where an email starts received within the shared inbox. With the help of hiver. We make it super easy for your team to effectively manage these emails as well as efficiently manage and collaborate on these emails within the shared mailbox. In terms of our AI offerings, we do provide a ton of AI offerings to, you know, make managing these emails even more efficient. A quick follow up on the question that you mentioned, right? Regarding an AI chatbot, can you dive a bit deeper into what exactly you would be looking for from an AI chatbot perspective?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Yeah. So basically, what we are looking for is a chatbot which could be facing for employees. So employees coming with queries, instead of managing this via email, we would like to explore opportunity with potential migration with hibob or any other way that we could actually provide better service to employees. So do not focus maybe on managing emails like right now, but to bring it a bit to a next level via some link or widget. I noticed there are many options generally in the world for that type of things that employees can go. And they basically can firstly connect with the bot with a loaded knowledge base based on what we prepare. And then they have also option to connect with person. Do you offer something like that as only purely email management system?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  No, we definitely do provide a live chatbot interface as well, right? But I was just a bit intrigued because you're an HR team. I would want you to understand where you'd like to host the chatbot to begin with, right? So I believe, do you all have an internal portal through which your employees, can, you know, initiate a chat with a chatbot? How would you like? How do you?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  We can initiate it via HR system hibop or hapio. So like our intranet as well. Okay, we don't have to necessarily because Daria, you mentioned maybe it's not possible to connect it with your hibop, But even if not, then we could also still use hapio, for example, the intranet basically anywhere that our link could be, you know, inputting for employees to have reference to that would be great. And also we would be interested in some kind of solution from the backend. So the managing of analytics and like ticket center. You know what I mean?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. You know, and glad that you mentioned the intranet right? Because getting hibop on another application would be a bit challenging but it should be possible like hibop, but getting the hiver chat on an intranet would be pretty straightforward to get that done. So, yeah, as of today, we do provide two options when it comes to the chat instance. We give you a live chat option as well as we give you the ability to build a chat workflow which is not AI driven as of now. But by the end of the quarter, we should have a fully fledged AI chat bot that can manage emails, sorry manage chats, very similar to how a human would. And essentially, it would use your knowledge base as the database to answer questions.

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Can you just remind me to when you're planning to induce… the chat bot option?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  I can send you the exact timelines, but in terms of eta, it should be latest by the end of the year that's at least what we've got internally as communication until you know something comes up and things change, then there may be a delay. But realistically speaking by the end of the year is when we are looking to go live with the AI chat bot instance. One thing I do need to be clear here is that our chat bot instance works on a separate product called hiver Omni, which helps, you know, the team internally manage the chats that come in. So let's say if the AI chat bot is answering the chat, but for whatever reason, the employee wants to speak with an actual person, there could be two options. One is they could either have that sent out as an email so that a team member can get back to them. But if you all want to provide like a live chat service, so that a, one of your team members can step in and manage the chat, then yeah, that would be another product called hiver Omni through that interface which they can manage the chats. Yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Raghav, can you hear me or is it just or Daria, is it just me or I can hear?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  You now? Yeah, I can hear you.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Okay. I think.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Marisha, it's on travels?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  So,

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  okay. Okay. All right.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  So, Daria, if you could just help me once again with the name of the intranet that you're what do you all call that? Happy?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Pepeo? Yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Pepeo. Okay. Yeah. And I'm guessing this is all managed internally by your it team, right?

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  I believe, yes, but it's an interesting question as I'm not aware at all. Okay. I know that it.

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Exists, it's.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  open live.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Okay. I'd like to see how this intranet you know, works right now. So, since we're waiting for Maria to join back, are you comfortable in just sharing your screen and giving me a quick overview as to how? Yeah.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Give me a second. I need to get there. Yeah… share my screen. Okay.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Okay. Marisha sent me a message that her laptop crashed again so she will be in a second day. Yeah. But can you see my, okay. You cannot see my screen. I,

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  could I could see your screen?

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Great. So, yeah, basically, here is a happy and we have their channels and also like channels for different groups of the people. Also, we have there some pages related to the finance people team and et cetera. So where we store all of our policies and like important information.

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  So,

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  and.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  yeah. And there are a lot of other tabs which honestly said, I'm not using. So, I know about those two, but here is some launcher. So basically, some, maybe forms or stuff like that. Yeah, honestly say that my presentation skills on those on this tool is.

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Very.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  limited.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  oh, no, that's fine. I think this is what I exactly wanted to see.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  So, yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And I'm assuming that you would want to have like the chat bot widget, you know, set up on this page, itself, right?

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  From my understanding, yes, honestly, I'm not involved as of now to these conversations already. So I'm not sure what is the idea? How it should work? So.

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Yes, understood. Sorry, I'm back, my laptop totally crashed. Everything just froze. So I had to restart it.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Oh, no, you're good, Maria, don't worry that's fine. So, yeah, I was just… I think it wants you to take a holiday already. Yeah. So yeah, I was just chatting with Daria regarding the happio intranet just getting an understanding as to how that looks so that, you know, I can take that to my product team to just confirm, I think, 99 percent, we should be able to host the chat widget on the intranet.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  I don't see that as being a hurdle by any chance. But yeah, I wanted to check with you, how do you envision the entire workflow working out for your employees?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  So, basically, obviously, just in a general overview idea is, I would like for employees to have some kind of, entry. So, for example, they visit intranet, yeah, link whatever, and then they can click and basically move to the chatbot. Initially chatbot should be able to give answers based on AI, learning from our documents like playbooks, Daria. You know what I mean? All, of the information, if employee, for whatever reason, will not be able to find information there, it should simply, give the option for employee to, I don't know, click with specialists, whatever, you know, this kind of tab, and then it should create some kind of ticket for the, for our team members, or live chat. Does not really matter, because obviously, we'll not have anyone working on it. It's like one of the tasks that team is doing. But to simplify also employee experience, that would be, my idea that, the reason why I'm mentioning it and I know how it works is that I had it in my previous company actually launching it. So this kind of way we could still keep with the emails. If you don't offer any ticket center, what I was mentioning, but obviously, if there's, some dedicated place for only managing these tickets, that would be also awesome because we can just take analytics, and everything, from that, some kind of also rating opportunities, that employees can rate the service and also give some kind of, comments, you know, what they would improve stuff like that?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  All right. Yeah, thank you for giving me, an understanding as to how you envision the entire workflow to look like, right? So, I will just get back to you as to what we can offer, in the next couple of weeks, just keep you updated as to where we stand as of today with the AI chat offering. But, yeah, by the end of the year, most likely, that offering should be available for me, what I'm just trying to figure out, you know, since y'all, are currently on the Gmail interface, how it would look like once we set it up within, other product called hiver, Omni, yeah. Raghav, do you have any inputs? Any questions on this?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, no, I think you're spot on there, Deandre?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Okay. So yeah, we can definitely get back to you with more information on that. In the meantime, coming back to the email interface, hiver in Gmail and the AI features that we are already, talking about. I know one of the big features that your team uses pretty often is the AI tagging. Now, with the help of tags, this helps your team with two things. One is in organizing emails into different categories and filtering out these emails, for future references… pulling out the right data and helping your team get the correct data. Once these tags are applied, to the email. Yeah. Maria, do you have any questions for me? Or do you have just based on what you?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Based on what also already team is using, I wanted to check how this is possible, how it would be possible for auto tagging… for the location of the employee, if there is any option there?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Great point. And then that's one thing I also wanted to check with you. Now, when you speak about locations, these are coming from different countries, different regions, right? And when your employees, speak in a specific, sorry, send you, an email, is it in their local language or is it in always in English? Or maybe Polish?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  It depends, I think what you, Daria, mentioned that sometimes Polish are in like Polish employees write in Polish, but sometimes they also write in English. Daria, you probably would be the best to answer that.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Yeah, basically, we have already, set up automation. So, basically all emails which we receive in Polish language, it's automatically, Polish, country tag is applied for this kind of emails, but basically all other countries. Okay. Sometimes we receive mails also in German language, but mostly, it's still, only English. So, yeah, basically, we've been discussing also already this one. So, yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, we did test out the AI tagging feature. Now, the AI tagging can tag, emails based on the language, you know. So let's say if it's coming in German, it can automatically tag it in German, you know, or Germany coming from the Germany region. I think the only, kind of roadblock we hit here is, you know, let's say if a person is writing in from Germany, but they're writing in English, then the AI tagging can't really, add much value unless, you know, there is like, whenever the person reaches out to you in the bar in the body, like let's say in the signature, would the person also mentioned like the address or anything of that sort?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  So let's say, if a person, is sending you an email from, let's say Germany, right? Would they also mention the local address of that specific kid? Okay? Let me get back to you on this specific, ask regarding regions, right? I think I would need to, also just wanted to check with you. Do you, can you have, show me like an example of an email that's coming in from another country? And how specific you want to go with the region? Is it based by country or is it based by specific areas within a country?

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Yeah. Basically, I can show it to you. Give me a second. I will open some mails which I have,

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  maybe not.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  I will try to find someone. Yeah. Give me a second, show my screen.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  So, basically, we, we've created, a country tags, using the international abbreviation for the countries. Basically, for Germany, we use, D, E, DEU, and for Poland, it's Paul and yeah. So here, you can see for example, males assigned for the person responsible for the German, country. Okay? Like this is not a good example as we have still some words in German, as it is an internal communication. But mostly, basically, we receive it in the way where you can see, hi, team, please find the touch or like it could be some kind of question. So, there is like no, mentioning of any country, but, okay, maybe, useful that we have in some of the signatures mentioned the, location, but still like, used by all of the colleagues, like when they are sending internal, mails to us. Okay? So, it's like also questionable, but mostly like our country takes this as D, U, friends, it's fra, Spain is ESP and stuff like that. So, this is a way of our, country taken for the emails.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Okay. Thank you for that. And in terms of, like what the workflow looks like, let's say you apply, let's say if an email comes in from, Spain and, you go ahead and apply the ESP tag to it, what is the next steps? Like, is there a specific person who's in charge of working for emails coming in from Spain? How does that workflow look like?

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Yeah, like, mostly, yes, but, and yeah, I know that, during some time, we use this auto motion also, once you apply a country specific text, so, within the auto motions, this email was, assigned to some person who is responsible for this country. But, now, when we have a, like, covering, a lot of countries for few people. Sorry, few people are covering the same country in the same time and it's not divided. Let's say that someone is, covering only contractual changes and another person is covering, let's say only benefits. So, it's like also not super helpful as, in this case, email could be assigned to someone who is like, not like really responsible for this section of the country.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Understood. And, and so, my, I think my question was more on the lines of like, what is your end goal once the tag is applied? Or what, firstly, why you all take the effort of applying these tags? Is it to get the data within analytics from, is that the primary reason? Yeah.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Yeah. So, basically, we are using those, tagging, to be able to analyze the data, like how much emails do we receive per country? And like all the further analytics, depending on the country, on all of the country's, workload. So, basically, and the main issue is the fact that, especially now, for example, when we receive an email and we have, in the same time set it up some automotions, but also this AI tagging. So, an email could be like, let's say, tagged, within the two tags, let's say, it service ticket, and in the same time, let's say onboarding, for example, yeah, but, the tagging will, is not include, the country tag. And sometimes it happens that, those emails are just closed without the, adding a country specific tag. And basically, the issue that at the end of the month, for example, like last month, I was applying let's say manually, all of those tags, like it's a recurring exercise. So, it's, done on a monthly basis. And we had like 154 emails which did not include, the country tags. So, it's like additional workload for the person who is responsible for analytics. And, basically, we need to still open it. So, it will make our lives easier in case, if we at least have already the country tags, because at some point, we are like, more interested, in the statistics and analytics for the, as per country. So, maybe it's like, okay, what is the subject of mail? It's also important for us, but for this like, mostly no one, forget about adding the subject. But, like, I mean, tagging subject, but, yeah, the country tagging is like, a little bit painful.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. Now, I completely get where you're coming from. And why do you see this as a pain point, right? As I mentioned earlier, the auto tagging or the AI tagging works really well when the language is specific to that region. However, if it's let's say, if it's English, it gets a little bit hard for the AI tagging, to, apply the tag based on a specific country. So, let me see. What if we can have tags applied based on geolocation for the AI tagging side of it. Yeah. Cool. Anything else that you would like to see especially from an AI, perspective?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Perspective, the chatbot definitely is our goal because we would like to obviously offer a bit better experience for employees, but also, I think it would make, mostly, team life easier. Yeah. Daria, maybe you have any insights on like operational part, what do you think would be, still useful in the AI part?

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Like honestly, yeah, honestly said, maybe, I have a question about the fact that we've, we've been speaking last time that there will be a possibility to add a link to the knowledge base. And maybe by any chance, do you have any let's say, date, of the launching this, new feature?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Oh, yes. Okay. You, for the hiver co pilot that?

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  You're talking about, yeah, for us? AI, yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  So the link, or may I ask right now, what is the knowledge base that you all use? Is it based within the intranet or?

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  No. Basically, for now, we've uploaded some of the files, some of our playbooks and like internal guidelines there. So, and honestly, I believe it was maybe last week or a few weeks ago, I saw that there is already visible, the possibility to insert the link, to the document and I tried to do it, but it didn't work. Yeah, but I just give it a try. So, yeah, it would be ideal as we have mostly all of the documents like live documents, so, which we are, yeah, dating on a daily basis. So, for now, it's like, We've tried it within the team, how it works as, you introduced it to me last time like the way of working of this, feature and it's really nice and it's really helpful that it could save us time even when we have some new joiners within our team. So they do not need to go and search it manually. But yeah, it's still also, for now, it's questionable like, As some as, due to the fact that we need to upload it manually and the document is changing like from day to day.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  So, it could create a confusion within the team. So, in case, if we will advise new joiners, like, okay, you can use it here. It will provide you with the correct information, but at the end like of the day, in case, if someone's changed something in those guidelines, so, yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  No, I get it.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Incorrect information. So like, if there is a possibility, really like for linking the documents from our let's say, G drive. So, it's super helpful and it's like really could make our lives easier.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that makes absolute sense. You know, so perfect. So, I have three action items that I need to work on. One is getting you updated regarding the AI chatbot, so that you can have it hosted on one of your intranets. The second is regarding tagging, if you can have AI tagging features to tag emails based on location and not just limited to language. And the third one is, the ability to add Google drive, document links on the AI copilot so that your team members can leverage these, the AI copilot when it comes to answering questions, not having to upload the documents, but just have that live link available, making it easier to manage or get the right information and the most updated information. Cool. Yeah, I'll go ahead and check with my team internally and share feedback with you over an email. But if at all, anything else comes up in the meantime, feel free to let me know and I'll be happy to try and work on it, give you an answer if it's possible or if it's not possible. Yeah.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Yeah. And maybe I have one more question which is not related to the AI stuff, but also, we've been discussing with you last time about the consolidation of two mailboxes which we have, like we still did not get to some decision, but I wanted to check with you before we will make any decision on this one in case, if we will consolidate those two mailboxes. So, would we have access to the, all historical mails which will be stored under this? Like let's say, HR Germany mailbox as basically, like let's say, maybe a few years ago, we were checking, with our internal tech teams, the possibility of, closing fully closing, this HR Germany mailbox. And basically, they confirmed to us that there is no, like, okay, there is such possibility. But in this case, if we will close it, then we will lost access to all historical, conversations from this HR Germany mailbox. And I just want to confirm in case, if we decide to consolidate those two mailboxes, like let's say within the hiver. So… will this lead us to the situation where we will still have access to all of the historical conversations or we don't.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  okay. Oh, great question. So, I'm just looking at the German shared mailbox, on the backend that I have here, it tells me that it's a Google group. Okay? So, it's easy to have it, you know, consolidated into one single shared mailbox with the current shared mailbox that you're using, in terms of historical information, right? So, this shared mailbox was set up in, within hiver in November 20 22. And I think, so the person who will have it, so only Martina, she would have access to the historical information, people like, you know, for example, Daria and,

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Julia.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Julia, sorry. Sorry for that. Yeah. So, they, I see that you all were just added like a couple of months ago to these, to the shared inbox. So, you would not really have, like let's say, if you're searching for an email that's two or three years old, you would not have access to that information. That information will only be available with Martina. But the good thing is, let's say if there's an email that's two or three years old, and if a new response is received on that email thread, it will still show up within the consolidated instance of the hiver, shared inbox.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Okay. And for example, let's say, I don't know we will, process this consolidation and I don't know Martina will decide to leave the company. So, will we have a possibility like let's say, to reassign the person who will have all of this historical access? Or, in case, if Martina left the company, so, like, no one will be able to get, to those old conversations?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  So, since it's a Google group, the historical conversation will always be available within the Google workspace that's your Google admin console. So, the it team or let's say, if you are part of the original Google group, which I cannot see through hiver, you can check with your it team. If you've been added as a member within the actual Google group, then you will always have access to those historical emails. So, as long as the it team does not actually delete the Google group, which in this instance is, HR at secretescapes de, you will always have access to those historical emails within your Google admin console.

Daria Obrimcakova (daria.obrimcakova@secretescapes.com):
  Okay, great. Thanks a lot. I will then check it within our, tech team. So we can, we… will, so we, oh, sorry. So we could be sure that, there is no, no, issues for us to consolidate those. Because understand, like now, during last meeting, I was more positive about this change, but now, I'm already not so positive about this kind of change. But, yeah, okay. I will check. And basically, Marisa, maybe we'll get back to you with the decision during your next.

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Meeting. And, yeah, and maybe you, Marisa want to suggest the date, which is, which would work for you. Yeah, also, I wanted to check one thing with you because you already mentioned that we need to make a decision by the… next meeting.

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Okay? So, it's, because I would also like to get some kind of offer for pricing, because I would also obviously need to have some approval, of course, yes, by myself. So if you could share with me some final pricing, offer, that would be great and also the answers to our AI questions, that would be also awesome.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And, and one quick question like, how crucial is the AI chat to this decision for you?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  What that's also, one thing, for how long if you would be, decided to go with, the current setup, let's say, for how long it would be the commitment?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  So currently, the current setup, if you go ahead, it's based on your current contract. And I think, the current contract that we have is an annual contract that runs out until July of next year, somewhere around July, next year. I can, let me just quickly pull out the actual dates if I can get that right now. But yeah, Daria, in the meantime, what I've done is I've just sent you a link to the Google groups. You can just quickly have a look at it and see if you have access to, you know, the German shared inbox, through your Google groups. Okay? And in terms of the contract, yeah, it's until June ninth, 20 26. My bad, June ninth, 20 26.

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  So, if you were to decide by 20 that we go with, that would be the commitment in June.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yes, that's correct?

Maria Elbert (maria.elbert@secretescapes.com):
  Okay. Cool. So, I will be waiting for, offer from you, what would be the final pricing? And then we can, go from there, and also obviously, for the answers to our questions about chatbot and things like that.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  All right. Sounds good. Perfect. Well, thanks for your time, pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to connecting with you both soon. Yeah. Thank you. Bye.
