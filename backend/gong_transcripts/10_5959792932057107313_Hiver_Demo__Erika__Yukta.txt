================================================================================

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Erica. How are you? Hey?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Everything good. Please give me five minutes please.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Sure. Let me know whenever you're ready.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Sorry… just a moment.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Hey, sorry, I'm here again, no.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries at all. Shall we get started with the discussion?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Yeah, I'm here.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Great. Perfect. Thank you firstly for scheduling this session with us. I'm so sorry, I won't be able to come on video. I hope that's okay. But yeah, looking forward to help you sort of understand how hiver works based on what exactly you're looking for.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So if you could just take a few minutes explaining what exactly you're working on today for which you're looking for a tool like hiver, I think we can take it from there and I can help you understand if it's the right fit?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Yeah. Well, actually, we are looking for a tool who can help us to have better data, you know, because we are using Freshdesk. I don't know if, you know, what is this tool? It's something related to emails, but we have two tools unify the whatsapp and email and the same tool, you know, because we are using response for whatsapp and using Freshdesk for response or our chats. So it's a little bit disgusting, you know, having these dot bot tools, we don't have the information centralized information. We don't have NPS for example, that's really important. So that's our context. I'm the head for customer success. And I don't know I was working in this company for two three months and I was looking for a new tool because we need to improve the experience for our clients. So that's the reason we are looking for other tool and we found a hiver, yes, that's the name hiver. So, yeah, we want to have more information about it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, currently, you're using Freshdesk, right?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Yeah, yeah. But it's not good. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's not, and how long has it been since you have been using Freshdesk? I.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  don't know maybe one year. I'm not sure because I was starting working with this company. I don't know two, three months. So I don't have the whole information, no.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries and what are the challenges that you're facing with Freshdesk today? Well?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Actually, we don't have any data. We don't have NPS and the lsas, it's very difficult to set up, you know, because we have a 24 hours, but we need at least hours to respond.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  We think 24 hours is too much, you know? So what this tool… I don't know they have more options, just 24 hours.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  24 hours for what?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Yeah, yeah. For response. So this is our lsa for a client. So I think it's a long time, 24 hours to respond. It's too much, you know? So we are looking at a tool that helps us to adjust, let's time, you know, maybe four hours to response for these first response time, you know, no, no, 24 hours.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And so I'm assuming that Freshdesk also would have adjustable SLA, where you can set up the hours less than 24 hours or the team can respond to these emails as soon as they come into the, you know, into the portal.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So as soon as an email comes in, the team can actually respond to it right there. And then, right? Or are they waiting for 24 hours to respond to these emails?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Yeah. That's that's correct. And actually response is other tool, what we have. And in this tool, it's I don't know because we have whatsapp there in the other part in Freshdesk. So we are looking something better, you know, to have all in the same tool. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What are you using on Freshdesk?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Gmail… OK?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But what are the channels that you're using on Freshdesk? Is it email and whatsapp as well you mentioned? Or is it just email just?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Email and response? Is the other thing it's whatsapp?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  OK. And how many people do we have in this team today?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  I don't know maybe six or 10 members for our team?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Six to 10 people. Yeah, got it. And could you also explain me about your role or are you heading this team here today? Yeah.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  I'm the head of customer success. So, I was starting working with this company. It's openbiz. We are making. I don't know we… make bookkeeping we open lsas in the United States that's our core and we are looking, yeah, better tool. Freshdesk. We don't have MPS, you know, that's really important. We don't have any satisfaction for the clients. We don't know anything. So that's really important.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  MPS, what is that?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  We don't have anything with Freshdesk. So it's really bad… when you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  say you don't have anything, could you explain what exactly you mean by that? We?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Have data with Freshdesk. So we are.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  looking for that, you don't see data there? No.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  No, no, anything. So it's really basic this tool. I don't know if you know about Freshdesk. I'm.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  very well aware about Freshdesk. So it's a little weird that they're not saving data. So how does it happen? Anything that is on their portal? It vanishes, it doesn't stay on the portal.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  No, we don't have, actually, we don't have anything about MPS. I don't know if about the, I don't know maybe it's, the plan. I don't know. I'm not sure because I don't have this information. It's our CEO who manage the information about the billing or plans. But in my experience, on my view, we don't have anything about MPS. You know, we don't have any data. We don't have anything. So, yeah. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So from the new tool that you're looking for SLA, is one thing that you mentioned that you would want to adjust the SLA time, how much time the team is taking to respond other than that, is there anything else that is like a must have for you that are important? Yeah.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  MPS dashboard, buried data we don't have, for example, we can't to classificate the tickets. We don't have this option because.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Just.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  write the email, just response and that's it. So we need more data, you know, okay to make better decisions. Got it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cool. I think I can show you something which, you know, covers all these points that you mentioned also. Erika, is there any timeline by when you're looking to implement this? Do you have any process of implementing a new solution internally?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  I don't know maybe one month, two months?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So in the next quarter, right? Yeah. Okay. And are you the one who is going to be leading this initiative or will there be more people involved in this as well?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Me, I'm the CEO, but I'm the full responsible for the new tool.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Perfect. Then let's dive in, understand how the tool looks like and what it can do for you? And I can take your questions as we go along this presentation or the demonstration. Could you confirm if you can see my screen? Yeah, I can.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  See you great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So, just a quick introduction. Erika hiver is a solution. It's an AI powered customer service tool that sits right on top of your Gmail itself. So it integrates within your Gmail itself. So that you don't have to use a separate platform. What you have to do is you just log into your Gmail account as I've done here and you will download the hiver extension. And that's how you would have these yellow colored icons that you see here. Now, one thing to note is your primary inbox will remain as it is, you will keep receiving and sending your private emails. These will not be hampered or impacted by hiver hiver's functionalities are going to be restricted to these folders that you see. So these are the tiny folders, which are, you know, different shared inboxes that we have created connected to different departments' email addresses. So likewise, we will create one that will be connected to this support email address that you have, at which you receive all the customer related information emails, right? So we will create that inbox here. Let's say we take an example of support inbox that I have here for this example for this demo. And we will add all the six to 10 people who need to be part of this so that everybody now can access and manage this centralized inbox by logging into their respective Gmail accounts, right?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  How the workflow will look like, is since this is AI powered. So AI will automatically be doing certain tasks for you in order to make it a lot more scalable. So as you can see, these are the sections that will define your day to day workflow. Starting with the unassigned section here, which will contain all the new tickets or all the new emails that are being written to this email address will come into this section here, right? And as soon as the email comes in, there are a couple of things which are already done for you. For example, AI will give the sentiment to the email to understand whether it's a positive email, a negative email or a neutral tone. So that accordingly, as a team, we can prioritize our emails. You would also have this little gray pill button. This is your SLA, by the way which we can set in the backend, and we can change it as well. So in the backend, you can set up as per your workflow, as soon as an email comes in, how much time should we take to respond to that email? Should it be within one hour? Should it be within two hours, three hours? Accordingly, this little pill will change color. It will be gray. As soon as an email comes in. If you breach the SLA, it will turn red so that you know, as to where you stand in terms of following these policies that we have created for the team, right? And with that, you also have these tags which currently says as feedback billing. This one is about feedback. So these are the tags basically to classify your emails or tickets into different categories, right? So that when you click on this email without having to go through it, you already know that this email is about feedback or billing, right? So that accordingly, you can give this to the right person in the team. So these are the couple of things which will already be done as soon as an email comes into this inbox, we can also assign the email automatically based on these things that are happening. So, for example, if you have a specific person in the team who takes care of all the emails related to feedback or billing, we can automatically assign those emails to that person, right? So that it directly goes into their mind section here. Okay. Now, for now, I will just show you this is the activity panel by the way that you see on the right side of the screen, this is where in the assign to section, you can see everybody's name and faces, and you can then give the ownership as to who needs to work on this particular ticket, right? So if I assign this to myself, you will see now we only have two remaining tickets. That are sitting in the assign section, and the one that we have assigned it will go into that person's mind section. This is where I know all the open tickets that I am responsible for, and I need to work on. Okay. Any questions so far? Am I confusing you going too fast? Just let me know.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  No, no, no. You're going very well. Don't worry. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Great. Cool. So as I said, since we like as we assign the ticket that will come into the mind section, this is where I will know. Okay, this email has come in. I will see, this is related to this topic. So basically, you can create tags as per your own workflow. So these are not by default as per how you would like to classify your tickets, name them. You can just do that and you just apply those tags and AI automatically applies for you once you start applying the same tag to the same kind of emails, right? And while responding here, I'll just delete this draft that is written. So while you're replying to an email, you can actually use AI to help you drafting your responses as well, right? So the AI in hiver will be trained on your company resources. So you can actually feed any PDF, any knowledge base, anything that you find useful that AI could train itself on. You can actually feed everything in the backend. And from there, you can ask AI to either draft a response, reading this email that has come in or you can ask any question that you want. And with that, you can just insert that response here and it's good to go. So that's for more of like contextual emails that are coming in for the standard emails, where the responses are repetitive. You can actually put all those standard responses in hiver's email templates, repository. And while you're responding to any email, you can just pick any template or any right response that you want to put here and make a few changes if you want fix the grammar, spelling, anything that you would like to do here and just hit send. So the response is gone. And now you will come here to the status column and you will change the status to from open to either pending. If you are still expecting a response from the other side. But if you think that this is done, there is no more work to be done on this email, you just come here and mark it as closed… right? Okay. Right. Yeah. So once you mark it either closed or pending, these emails are going to reside within these designated section, pending ones, you can find here and the all closed emails you can find in this section right here… right? So any closed tickets or any pending tickets that you have, if you get a response from either of these, they will come back into the mind section. So that you don't have to keep checking these sections here. And for your data, everything is since hiver is working on top of your Gmail, your emails are going to remain as emails only. Whatever you're doing in hiver, it. Was going to remain in hiver itself. So your data is safe and it's stored in hiver so that you don't lose anything in terms of your data on a day to day basis. Okay, great. Great. That's really.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  I don't know, I think it's really good, better than Freshdesk because I.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  don't like.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Freshdesk that's.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  fine.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  It's really, so basic. You just have just the option the response or to close this ticket and that's it. So it's horrible. Yeah, no worries.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I just want to make sure that the workflows that you would like to achieve, we achieve that through hiver and play with a lot of, there are a lot of things that you can do here. And I don't want to bombard you with a lot of details right now. Just going to give you a basic workflow of how you can achieve different things without making it a lot complicated, right? So, we have covered a couple of things here. We have seen how we assign tickets to each other, how we can create tags to classify those tickets into different topics. All your tags will reside here in this section called tags. So that if you want to pick emails related to one topic, let's say billing, I just click on billing and I can fetch all the tickets which are related to billing itself. And likewise, you can create these tags for yourself to streamline this. And for the collaboration amongst team members, right? On different tickets, this is where the team section is going to come into the picture wherein anybody can go into the team section, and we can see across the entire team who is handling what, and how these tickets are currently distributed between different team members, so that we have that transparency and visibility at all times. So, for example, if matt has two open tickets that he's working on, anybody or I can just go into it, see what's happening here, what this email is about. Oh, he has also written a draft on this one. Great. I can see edit this if I want to collaborate with him, if I want, I can just share a quick note to him from this note section. So this is going to be for our internal communication. So that if I need to write to matt, please review the changes I made in the draft, right? So anything that I want to type, I can do that and multiple people can collaborate on the same email without diluting the ownership. Still, matt is the ultimate owner of this ticket, but still multiple people can collaborate on the same email. This is for our internal communication. Okay? So you,

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  know it's very good.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Don't.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  worry. It's it's cool.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, great. I just want to make sure that, you know, if you have any question if there is anything I can take that up as well. But, yeah, great. I think this is something that could be useful as well from the collaboration perspective. And from there, also like if someone is not available, is out of office, they have a lot of tickets in their radar. You can just easily go and reassign those to someone else so that we don't miss anything and somebody else can do the work while, you know, this person is away or out of office?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Okay, great. So how I can see the data or the dashboard, so how I can see that?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yes.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  That's the.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Next segment that I was just going to go in for that, we will just go into the analytics part. This is where you will be able to see the dashboard, the metrics, how we are performing. Everything is going to be here. It's it's very simple. It's divided into two parameters. You will see the workload as to how the shared inbox or the, how the inbox is being, you know, loaded how many emails we are getting, what's the traffic, how the team is performing.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And below, you will see the performance for each person depending on what metrics you're interested in, right? So you can choose for any timeline, let's say, I want to see for last 90 days. This is the contribution report which gives you the total active conversations we have had in last 90 days, how many new we have received and how many we have closed, and what's the average response time for these? You can also go for each user individually. So for all six to 10 people who are part of this inbox, you can see individually, how many emails have been assigned to each of them, and, how they have been performing? Like what's their average response time? What's their average response time, the first response time, and average resolution time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So this will give you some idea into how they're performing. If you have a SLA set up. For example, we want the team to give the first response within one hour and should close the ticket within 24 hours. You can actually see how much of the team is actually being compliant to this policy and how much of the team is violating this policy. So you can further analyze this. You can go to each user. You can group it by each assignee and you can actually see what are those emails that Yukta has missed responding to, right? Or what are these emails that Rakesh has missed responding to? So you can actually see the violation. And you can see each email also that has, wherein we have violated these slas, so you can actually drill this to the level wherein it gives you the understanding of, you know, how much we have missed and how much we are performing. So, these are the metrics that you will get anything that you are specifically interested in or this is something that you wanted. Yeah.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  That's okay with this. Don't worry. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worry, don't.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Worry. I was doing something like this. So it's okay. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Does this, does this, align with the reports and dashboards that you were talking about? Are these the reports that you wanted to see on a regular basis? Okay?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Sorry. Wanted to.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Confirm, like are these reports that you wanted to see on a regular basis or something else? You will have dashboards as well, like you mentioned. So you can create your own dashboard also, so you can pull different reports that you are interested in. And you can create your own custom dashboard which you can look at on a day to day basis or a weekly basis if you want. Okay?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  If I want to see for example, these MBS or satisfaction about the clients, how I can see it if.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  you want to see what?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  The satisfaction, no MBS for the clients or I don't know if someone say this is the horrible service or whatever I don't know is your name?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So csat is something that you can put after your emails. And this is where you'll be able to see the feedback that customer is writing or giving. You can see all of it, how much has been marked as satisfied? Okay, not satisfied. So, these are the ratings that you can see. And for each person, then you can see what are those emails wherein they have been received? A bad rating, a bad feedback and what we can do about it in terms of improving that. So you will get those reports here. Okay? Great.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Well, this is actually, or I need, to do something for this, is that or how you just?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You just have to set it up in the backend, right? And after the email, then either you can choose to put it manually or you can, okay. So this is how it's going to look like at the end of the email. When I'm about to close the ticket, I can put this at the end of the email, you can change this as well as to how you would want. And the customer can choose either of these. And that's how the person who is the owner will be rated. And you can see in the analytics as to how much of the customers is giving us a positive feedback or how much of it is giving us a negative feedback in the sec, csat survey report here? Great.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Amazing. This is a good tool. So, how much is the cost let.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Me show you as well. These are the different plans that we have starting from the free plan, then we have growth pro, elite… things that we have just talked about, which is having slas, having the analytics are part of the pro plan even, I think will.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Be great because we have a six, 10 people manage these tools. So, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  SLA is also part of the pro plan. So, and csat is also part of the pro plan. We would be looking at the pro plan here and it will be costing you 65 dollars per user per month. So, if you're looking at 10 users, then it's going to be 650 dollars per user per month. Sorry. Yeah, 650 dollars per month. Okay. Yeah, okay.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Sounds great. So the base for user number, user, right? Per.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  User, yes, 65 dollars per user per month. Okay? So I.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  don't know if you have more information that, you can send me and I talk with my CEO and maybe the next week I can to talk with you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We have a free trial as well, by the way. So you don't have to directly implement this tool. I would rather suggest that if we can set up a trial call or a trial meeting where I can help you set this account up, and we can actually see in the real time how this is working for you. You can invite probably two or three people for the testing.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  In those seven.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Days, we can actually see how it's working. And if you like it, then you can probably, you know, think about implementing it for everyone across the team. Okay?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  So if we have a number in an email, you can help us to integrate this with the tool, or we need to make this integration for our site. I.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can help you set this up the setting. It will, the whole setup is not going to take more than minutes. You have a email address, right? For the support team for the customer team. So we just have to connect that email address, create the share inbox, like the one that I showed you and invite all the team members, do the settings, set up the SLA, C, set whatever we want and that's it. I think it's not going to take more than minutes to do this pretty.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Easy. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Thank you. You tell me like do you want to first discuss this internally? And then we should connect for the feedback call. When you will tell me how you would like to proceed or do you want to schedule the trial meeting right away?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Let me talk today with the CEO and I arrived, you to coordinate. If we make this trial, I think it's very great idea. And yeah, I will talking with you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is it okay if we just set up like a feedback call in that case for some time either on Friday or next week on fifth, if whatever?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  I think next week because our CEO, is it's today, but this, I don't know we are and maybe the whole team in holidays. So, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's why, I didn't want to, you know, happy new year to you too. You're based in Colombia, right? Yeah.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  I'm here in Colombia, Medellin, got it. It's.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  11 30 for you. So we connected at 11. Got it. Can we connect on Monday or would you prefer Tuesday next week?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  I think Tuesday the next week, I guess, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Tuesday, maybe this?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  This same time, it's perfect because I have a meeting with the CEO and then I came to talk with you and set up everything. So, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is it possible to just connect like an hour before then today? Like today, we connected at 11. Is it possible maybe?

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  Eight, I am or here?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Eight a. M. Also, you can do that. Yeah, yeah, nine a. M instead like just to, yeah, be sure. Yeah, great. Then let's connect on Tuesday at nine a. M. And I will share all the details with you. I will share the recording as well if you want. And, okay, let's connect on Tuesday and then you can let me know how you would like to proceed. And accordingly, we can take this forward. Yeah.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  For sure. Thank you so much for your time. All right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. Thank you so much for your time as well. Take care bye, nice.

Erika Vidal (erika@openbiz.io):
  To meeting you likewise.
