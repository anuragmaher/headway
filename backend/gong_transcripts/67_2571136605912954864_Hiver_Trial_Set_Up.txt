Call: Hiver Trial Set Up
Date: 2025-11-07T20:51:07+05:30
================================================================================

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  hello rockies.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hello? Hey, Victor. How are you doing?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Hey, Rakesh, we are good. How are you guys?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well. Thank you so much. Thank you for joining in. All right. And I've got Manoj with me on the other line. He's going to be the implementation and onboarding manager. After we had our first discussion, I gave you our entire use case so that we could help you set up your trial. But before we even get into it, you said you're going to be talking to the management internally, of course, with your team, also come back with the feedback. Did you get a chance to discuss hiver internally? And what are the first thoughts?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. I think the thoughts are that we're going to test it out. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. So everybody's keen to test and only then we present a use case internally and share, hey, this is what hiver would look like. This is what the life is going to be very easy for the email management. And then we'll look into the next steps. Yeah. Yep. Okay. All right. Great. Now, to be able to set up the account, a test account, you mentioned there are a couple of inboxes that you have like you've got four shared email inboxes. You've got two to three representatives, support reps, three to five support operational folks, and a couple of management folks. Also, we don't really need everybody on the call. By the way. This is just a setup so that we would only require the administrator to be part of this call, where we can help you set it up and tell you where exactly you can go ahead and add them as a user, so that when they are added into hiver account, they have got all of that set up and they just simply need to log in and start managing those emails for you. And this is what we're going to be doing today. While I already have Manoj on the line. Do you have any questions before we begin with the setup?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  No.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. All right. Now, do you mind sharing your screen and we'll help you with the account setup on your computer by step process?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  No. The question is, do we want to set it up for Patrycja? Because she's going to be managing this inbox or does it matter? Are we limited by, well, we are limited by licenses, right? Number of users.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We are, the pricing works on the number of licenses. But if you are not going to be the actual user who would work on hiver, we can always put you in non billing after the entire setup is done, because since you're going to be the administrator, I would urge you to be the admin.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let everybody complete the setup. And then if Patrycja has to be the administrator for one of those user accounts like inboxes, we can also keep her the admin. You can have multiple administrators that shouldn't be a problem.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay. Do you want me to go to hiver?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right, Manoj, over to you, buddy, if you could please help us? Yes, hiverhq. Com, the website?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Thank you, Rakesh. Hi, hi, Victor, Manoj here.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Hey, Manoj. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, I'll be taking over from here. So, yeah, I can see your screen. Okay? Victor, let's click on, start free trial and get started.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Use your email address continue?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Should I just do continue with Google? Yes?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Both works?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  I did the wrong one.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  We'll just see how it goes. If anything we'll redo it.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay. So we're going to have to unlock this.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  I just need to unblock this on our workspace.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Hopefully, this doesn't take too long. It might take a little bit.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Sometimes it just takes like five minutes or so, but let's just give it a couple of minutes. There we go. I like the tension… Gmail is going to reload with a sign… in prompt. Yeah, click on setup, hiver… the company details.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Do we want to chat? Try? How does the chat work? Do we have to implement it in our website first?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, it's a zero code. Once you start with the email management just beneath it, you'll also get an option to set up a chat. You'll get a snippet that you just need to simply put it on the source code of the website. You don't really need any coding as such. So it's just like a plugin on top of your website.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah, I got you.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we provide you with the code that you need. You can add the code to multiple web pages, have the nudges everything for the chat that you require it's pretty easy and, you know what?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We can help you with the phases as well. For the first phase, you want to just simply set up the email management, make sure everything works well. Second phase, you want to have voice calls and chat, also, third phase, you might want to set up, self, serve the help automation on the knowledge base. All of that is possible. You don't have to do all the things in one go that's my recommendation. We can always set it up step by step.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Got it. Okay. All right. Great.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Now, your first chat mailbox… this?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Is.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  going to be centralized?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Team inbox department inbox?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  So, customer service?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yep.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  All right. So, now, do we sign in as our customer service email?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that is another Gmail account, right? Victor, or is it a Google group or helios?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  It's a Gmail account?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Then you do sign in with Google. So this is just a one time authentication, right? Can we use a group?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  So, we don't have to use like a user license?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. You can have a distribution list.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yep. Okay. Well, let's do it like this for now and then we can figure out if we.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Want to. Yeah, absolutely. Once you figure out the Google group side of things, then we can change the setup before the trial ends, it's not going to be a.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Let me get the password. Do you remember it? Because it's going to be transferred to our… nobody.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  I read everything down. I'm sure. Where was it? Yeah.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Here's another account. Let's see next?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay. Now, do we want to start inviting some team members now?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can do so or otherwise, we can always come back to this later as well. Manoj. What do you recommend?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  We can come back to this later. Let's finish all the.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Setup, the complete setup. Okay. Fair enough.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay. Do this.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Later?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Do this later? Okay. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, done. So your trial account setup is complete. The shad mailbox setup is complete now, Victor, if you notice there is also a demo inbox listed. So demo inbox is something that we provide with a bunch of test emails like dummy emails, which you can work through since we are going to work out of the CS mailbox, we can go ahead and delete the demo inbox so that there's no confusion with that.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Done, can you click on Gmail on the top left?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yep.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. On the left, you should see customer service right now.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Got it. Nine emails.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Perfect.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  There you go.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  We got something on there, right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So since we set up a user account, we sync like a couple of recent emails that are there in the account. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah, you have, the all new emails are going to be in the unassigned, right? Yeah. Inside every email, you saw an activity panel, right? On the right hand side.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yep.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, this is where you're going to be assigning emails, set status, add tags?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  So, let's maybe add Patrycja in here. Okay. Replying… go ahead. What did you say? Manoj?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I was just about to say the custom fields, but, yeah, let's go add Patrycja first, and then we can come back to it later. No worries.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah, sounds good. Now, all of our users have essentially two emails. Our primary is go to logistics net and we have an, everybody has an alias of go to that us. Will that just like work together? Fine?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it works together. Fine. You don't have, so it's just an alias, right? It's not a secondary domain. Yeah, alias has worked just fine. Like you don't have to add the alias as a user?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  You want to add gosha? Yeah, it's just gosha, right? Gosha. Okay.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. Oh, she's not going to know what to do. Yeah, it's okay. So, do I install? Not yet? You have to do it on your computer? Okay? There is nothing we can download on the phone for this, right? There's no phone app or extension.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. We do have a phone app. Victor, we do have a phone application for hiver for Gmail, but I would suggest the first sign in, let it be in the system. Once you authenticate, once you add and you do a sign in with Google, then you use the phone application to log in.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Got it. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And Patrycja, you don't have to do all the steps that Victor did. So all you will be doing is you will receive a welcome email with a link to download the hiver extension. So, just download the extension, sign in to Google and that's it.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay. Thank you.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Everything else would have already been set up for you.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  All right. Yeah. So coming back to the right panel, Victor, so you have assignment, the three default statuses open pending and closed.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, open, are the emails that you're going to actively work on?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Pending and closed? Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Pending is something that you put on hold.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yep. And.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  closed. Is your result emails?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Got it. So this, I can't assign you yet. Tags. So here you can put like, you know, BFM or error or rates. I don't know.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Tags are going to be like whatever categories that you would like to, you know, have them set like a quick.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  One word thing that you can add and we can search later due date. Yeah, we can… like that you can. So at all, will only message the support technicians, right? This is going to be the chat for support, right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, just for the people who are within this team, like the mailbox?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Got it.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, and you can just add mention a specific person as well. It totally depends.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Huh. So who will see that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But there are two ways to look at it, Victor, either.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Your.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  an account with hiver, oh, okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, two ways to look at it, Victor, these comments option. I mean, either these users are particularly a part of customer support inbox, and Patrycja is maybe wanting to talk to Rakesh already is hiver user. We just want to talk to each other about this specific customer, the po, the shipment, the logistics, whatever, or think of a use case where Patrycja does want to talk about the finance. I mean, with the finance Guy to approve of some discount. Although now, in this case, finance Guy doesn't have to be a part of your customer support inbox, but you can still add mention their complete email address, invite that finance Guy as a collaborator for one time collaboration on ad hoc and that person should be able to access this email in question answer or whatever that needs to be answered. And it could be anything as such. So this is called collaboration outside the shared inbox, which is collaboration with your, it or finance or something on those lines.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay. How do we do that? So what if I want to invite somebody?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Manoj, can you help us with the external collaborations here? Please?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So Victor, do you see a person and a plus symbol right? Within the notes? Yeah, yeah. Click on it… just add the email address?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Just one caveat. I mean, you have to invite somebody from within your domain. I mean, you cannot add mention Rakesh at hiver, and collaborate. That's a separate thing altogether.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah. And this.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Collaboration?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You're not paying for by the way, this is not limited to license by the way.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Got it. So, how does that work? So I messaged Yaroslav right now on this.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  He would receive an email in the inbox stating Victor is trying to collaborate. He'll log in into that specific collaboration space. Look at the entire email, drop the notes or comments that you should be able to see in the activity panel back.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Huh.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Do you just reply?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  It's going to be a separate link for them Victor.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Click the link below to the email conversation. Okay? So, he does need to log in, yes?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah, no, no. It's anybody… would you go to a distance at that time? All the people would go to a distance and go to the us. So he needs to sign up, right? Because he's not registered.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  He doesn't have to sign into, you know, we are asking to sign into his account because that's the email address that you have invited. It's just for the collaboration space. They're not going to be added to the hiver account.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay. But he needs to sign up, right? Not sign in. Yeah, sign up… and I can continue.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Can you see me? You know… does he need to add the Chrome extension?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No, no, no.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  No, no. All right. Let's go back to the email. Can you?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Just like open the link since I'm not seeing the screen. Can you just open the link and ask him to enter his email address and do a sign in?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. That's what he did, it says your contract is available for that column you're currently logged into. Does the conversation to access is currently unavailable for that column you're logged into?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Do you mind joining us with the, I mean, joining us on a zoom meeting. Perhaps we can have a quick look at your screen. That is a little weird. I mean, this should not happen.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. Can you join the zoom? Yeah, I can join the zoom yep.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, Victor, until he joins, we… have a couple of other features like you can create custom views like the unassigned mind team will only have emails that are the open status. Then when you click on all views, you have two other sections with the spending and closed, which relates to the status as well. Okay. Apart from these five default views, you can create your own custom view. Let's say that you want to create a view for yourself with open and pending emails and the emails that has a particular set of tags, you can create that view and have that saved on the left hand branch.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, yeah, I've started sharing my screen, the conversation you're trying to have should be.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  The case? Yeah. So, can you go back to the email? So this is the email account that you have invited, right? Victor, yeah, the one he's logged into Gmail. Yeah.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, click on the private Pama link. Okay. This shouldn't be the case. Victor. Let me get this checked. Okay. Yeah, I'll have to check this. Maybe he needs to log out. Sorry?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Maybe he needs to log out.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Log out. Actually, this pop up, shouldn't be there at all because as soon as he clicks on the link, there should be a sign in prompt.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Derek, can you log out on the third tab? Yeah. Over here, refresh it. Maybe if you logged in… no, you don't.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  log into that, don't log into that?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Because that's going to create a dummy trial for his account. We don't want to create another trial, right?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. So that's what I was taking him through. Okay, we can look at this later. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  I'll get that checked on the backend.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  For now, we can just forward the email. If we need to have somebody participate, we can just forward it to Yara, right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, absolutely. So, Yara's, not going to be part of the chat mailbox, just curious.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  No, this is for customer service.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah, you can forward it even if he makes the responses and everything, it's still going to sync to the email chain and you'll still be able to see what exactly happened on that email.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yep. Okay. That's fine. And then you can send them clothes as well, right? Like right here, you can send them close it.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yep. You have to other options stand in pending send close and understand.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah… we go to close. We still have access to this. Yeah, I think it's going to be here after that or pending or sign because you only have.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  All righty.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Right now, if you notice on the right hand side, there is something called due date, right?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Huh.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  This is one of our custom field. Okay? Now, there are four types of custom fields. One is a date. The other three are like a name text and a dropdown. So, if you have further classification of emails or additional statuses that you want to give to an email based on like a priority level, you can use the custom fields dropdown to set up, you know, additional statuses and… etc. Okay?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Custom fields will be set up in the admin panel. So on the top, right? Do you see the hiver icon?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, admin panel.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, this is your primary dashboard where you have control over mailboxes, users, roles, and everything else. So, click on shad inbox. The second option on the left… select the mailbox. Now, these are all your mailboxes, advanced settings… custom field. If you don't require the due date, you can always disable and you can add a custom field dropdown.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And here you can, you know, as an example that I gave you like priority levels, you can have that… or if you have any other additional statuses on your mind, you can implement that as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Perhaps if you work with a handful of, you know, logistic providers or some suppliers or vendor list, you can have all of this data. Basically, it will help you organize that much better. And then if you want to run reports or analytics with respect to a specific logistics provider or a supplier or data provider, you should be able to kind of go ahead and, you know, filter all of those researches?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. I mean, we can do our terminals to try.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  No, because sometimes they.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  For a general.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  The H, turn… the H, turn down SLC, SLC, SLC, no, it's S o L, it's okay. Four turn Seattle, And S, ENCLE turn… a… turn. Yeah, that's fine.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  I think it's enough for now. I think we don't have any more. We can add Nicaragua and Poland if you want at some point require this field. When closing the ticket, I don't think we'll need that update. Okay? So now we go back to the email.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And you open any email within the mailbox?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. Okay. Now, I can select the terminal.

Support:
  Yep.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. And by the way, I've got Suhas with me from our technical support team with regards to the problem that we encountered on the collaboration space, Suhas could actually help us look at the actual error. Do you mind sharing the screen again?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We can just quickly fix this.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Nope.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah, I think so. Yeah… nemesis?

Support:
  Okay. So you were invited… could you try recreating it like you were invited to the conversation. But when you click on the link, you're getting this error message, is that right?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. And I think because he already logged in as a trial essentially? Oh, yeah, right.

Support:
  Because hiver thinks there is a legit email, it's trying to redirect him to the permalink instead of the collapse space?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. How does he log out? Can he just clear cookies?

Support:
  Can you share his email address?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Can you check if his email address has a dummy trial already?

Support:
  Yeah. Can you ping me his email address?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  You got it. The email, it's Yaroslav at go to logistics net?

Support:
  I didn't get it over here on the chat.

Support:
  Can you bring it over here? Okay. There we go. Perfect.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  We're going to be able to connect those two chats together. So, instead of going to our portal, we'll be able to reply through the Gmail. Yeah, the,

Support:
  account doesn't exist on our system. Oh, can you share another email? Like open another email and try adding Yaroslav in that email.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Sure. Let me remember how I did that before contact… here. Yeah… I really love it.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  It says, I am unable to share it for some reason here. I'll share my screen.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay. Yeah, that was great.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Can you see it?

Support:
  Yeah, I can see your screen. Can you perform a hard refresh just re, enable the conversation feature?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Looks like he's already on the list.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  So, he's already on the list. It looks like.

Support:
  Okay. Can you, is it the same email or is it a different email?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Same email?

Support:
  Okay. The one that was previously shared? Yeah. Okay. Can you try it on a different email? Like a brand new email or the one where it was not previously shared with her?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  I mean, we could try his alias. Do we want to try that or a completely different email?

Support:
  No, we'll try it on a different email in your shared mailbox, we'll use the same address, the primary address of your colleague, but then we'll open a different email from here, a different notification email and try sharing that?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Ah, maybe because they didn't put a note in… thank you very much. Do you want to try it like that?

Support:
  Yeah. Go ahead.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  All right. Yara, you want to share your screen?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  We're good. Should we click?

Support:
  Yeah, go ahead.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yes… we're going to clear his cache?

Support:
  This will probably log her out or she'll have to log back into her Gmail.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Oh, yeah. Okay. Can you?

Support:
  Go back to her Gmail and refresh the page once. Most probably she's logged out of her Gmail.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  The one that I was sharing?

Support:
  No, the one that she was sharing this one. Yeah, this one. Okay. So which account is this? Can you click on the profile picture, top right? Corner? Okay. So this is the account. All right. Okay. Now, can you click on the link once again? Okay, click on login to collab, space, the second login.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  This one. Yeah.

Support:
  Sign in with Google.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  OK. So things should work, I think.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay. So you have to assign him as collaborator. Got it. Okay. Always got to clean the cache. It's just, we're viewing the message that's it. Yeah, and conversation. I mean, I don't know if we're going to use it. I think we're just going to forward it, usually open chat because I don't see that there's a way to reply there's no way to reply. She would have to go reply over there. Add note. You're going to open chat. No, just do like add note or something. Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, this is basically to collaborate internally guys. I mean, if Yaro, has to reply to the customer on this behalf, then essentially, he needs to be a part of the mailbox, and then the better would be that Patricia assigns him the email and then he replies back so that's even better way to look at it.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah, most likely, we're just going to forward the email like we do today. I mean, we do have like we do need to collaborate with a lot of people because we have all these like separate terminals that are working nationwide and we don't necessarily want everybody to be in hiver doing customer support, but we definitely want to ping them occasionally if we have questions about the stuff that's going on over there.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. Yeah. I mean, if you do want to forward these emails, I mean, it's well and good. Otherwise Manoj can also share a quick, you know, Perma link that can actually generate a link to the conversation and we could even share it with anybody else even if they just want to review it and all of that. So that's also possible instead of forwarding, you could generate a link to the conversation.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay. All right. Let's keep going. What else do we need to talk about?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we did talk about the slas, couple of more functionalities, we'll have a quick look at it. Manoj over to you. We can, I think, let Suhas go off. He probably has another call to take Suhas. Thank you so much.

Support:
  No problem. Thank you. Have a wonderful day. Bye bye.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Bye bye.

Support:
  Okay.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  All right.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Hello, you guys there?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm here, I'm sorry, I was okay. All right now to be able to do the slas, let's hover around onto the admin page again.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And from here, let's go to the mailbox. All right, customer support.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, Victor, guys, I'm dropping off. I have another.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Meeting to do, Manoj. You take care of your next call, that's fine. I'll run the show, thank you. Thank.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  You. Thank you.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Guys. Thank you. Have a good one.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. So from here, let's go ahead and hover on the SLA, the second last bit here. And yeah, so this is where you can actually create the first response time to these tickets, the resolution time, and I'll tell you the difference here as and when there are new emails coming in and you can have the triggers or timings running on to the emails. So you can call it the general slas, if these are, yes, by default is a good way to look at it. If you have a very specific SLA for urgent emails, you can always pre arch those emails under tags and we can create a second SLA with a specific tag called urgent, or even if it is a specific SLA, which is not regular, but very much less though, you know, the quick answers to those emails now, since this is going to be a default email slas, what is the first response time you would want to have? So you can just put that there. How long are you okay to wait?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Six hours, 12 hours and resolution?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is, when you close the ticket, how long are you okay to wait? I mean, there could be a back and forth happening.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  48, two days, 48. All right. 48. I think it's good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. And if you want to notify anybody from the management or anybody else who's not even a part of it, you'll be able to go ahead and report them that, hey, was not able to respond if.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  It's missed, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, if it is missed or if it is due to notify, okay. Now, on top of it, there's one more recommendation I would like to do. Now, this is more like you've got a train to catch at five PM at the platform and you need to be there. I'm just trying to give an analogy. Now, before you reach at the platform, there should be a buzz that, hey, Rakesh, you've got two more hours to reach at the platform. That is more to do with the SLA due soon. So if you set up the status here, it could be more like a due soon notification before you reach to the six hour of breach in no more than three hours, you would get notified that this email has three more hours left. So most of my customers find it, super useful before they miss it. They have the priority emails which are due soon emails.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Everything is priority in our case. Well, I think let's keep it like that for now. We don't want to overcomplicate it, no.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Worries at all. Yeah, for.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Now, we don't even have any differentiation really the way we, you know, we just handle everything as first come first serve, and we don't even have an SLA, theoretically, this is just let's just do, maybe in case we miss anything, we get a notification.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. Yeah, yeah, I understand.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  And do we consider only business hours you need to first?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We can do that because, yeah, I mean, upon sending you a test email, I could see that you have got certain business hours for that. Let's just first of all, create the policy. I'll take you to the business hours as well. Now, can you take me to the settings please at the bottom here? And can you create a business hour template from here itself? Click on create. Now, create business hour, and this is where you could just call it general business hours or if you have daylight savings, you can even toggle that whenever the time turns on. So you have both options. So for now, you can just say default once drag and drop the hours. Oh, are you starting as early as five in the morning?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  I mean, theoretically, we're 24 seven like we have people working 24 seven. But yeah, at five, I think is the earliest that people will come here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, you could cross this one and drag this. Okay. Fair enough. Now, you also want to set up another timing for Saturdays and Sundays closed, I believe.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah, we have after hours between nine P. M and six a. M, Monday, Sunday till Friday?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Weekend. So, nine to six a M, nine P. M6 a M, six a. M. But it's from nine a. M, how to do it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's nine to four CST.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Nine P. M to four a. M6 a. M. That's the Guy who works, but he works Sunday starts Sunday till, I think Thursday because on Friday, he's not coming at nine P. M. So Friday and Saturday, I think we just completed here till the end. And then we just started here right? From zero to, Saturday because Saturday we have, we work nine a. M7 a. M. I, Wes is coming at seven a. M to like five P. M. Yeah, we have a dispatch, and then on Sunday there's a Guy nine P. M. Yes, nine PM till six a. M, Monday, and you will have to go… yes, from here, 2,100 till Monday, six a. M, till Monday. Well, we can just complete this whole thing then, right? Like that, something like that, but how to set up the after hours here? Like why would you touch it? I'm sorry. Okay, guys.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  As a recommendation, these are the general business hours for the business.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  These are.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  not the specific. Okay. So these are not the specific login hours for an individual. By the way, when an individual logs in, I'll get you to a setting where everybody has their own availability. They can choose to toggle on when they log in. And otherwise, they can just keep themselves away and the tickets won't be assigned to them. These are the hours for the general business. When I'm submitting a ticket, I should be notified that, hey, at this point in time, geologistics is off or am I expecting some more delay in the responses? So this is a business template for a whole like.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  The customer service in the office. So, so basically anything outside of that, the customer will get an automatic reply. Hey, nobody's in the office, you won't receive a reply until tomorrow, but then we can, like he said, we can set up, the temple for the night dispatcher. I think that would be separate. This would be just general. Hey, like we have a night dispatcher that's going to be working from nine to four a. M. We know that window is going to be manned by somebody. So we need to color it blue. Here. If we have nobody that's going to respond immediately, then we need to not color it. And then we're going to send it automatically. And whatever the schedule of the Guy in Poland is that's something else. So, do you think we have coverage of people on all of these or do you want to make it smaller between five? He does work till six a. M. But nobody's here after five P. M. So I would just leave it till seven unless he… is like California, they are already on the email, they are going to reply, but nobody's on the customers. But this is Monday, right? You want to do like till five on Monday and five every day, got it.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  And Saturday from five from seven to five, right? Yes. And then Sunday from nine PM till the end of the day. And then Monday, you guys will take over at five six. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Yeah, you can scroll down and then at the bottom, you also have some holidays that you can always come back and set the entire holiday calendar here as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, apart from this, could you also take me to the settings here, please? And then feature access. Let's… go ahead and turn on the out of office so that you give your entire team an access and availability to keep themselves toggle on and off as and when, you know, they log in and start to work for the tickets. So that's possible. Okay?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Allow you to control. Yeah, I.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  think that's okay? I mean, because you have an overlap shift and then even if the admin is not there, agents should be able to turn themselves on and off for the tickets. And if we turn on certain automations at the back end, like certain workflows hybrid will ensure that the tickets are not going to be assigned to those folks who are not available or who are aware who are out of office, as such, whoever?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Is available, is going to actually get the ticket assigned. And plus we're going to maybe include Nicaragua at some point, maybe we'll be able to clear up that whole calendar and open the whole thing. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. Now, let's go back again to the shared inboxes, complete the setup here. Now… shared inbox, take me to the second last settings. SLA, go back again, edit the slator. Okay? There's an edit option here. There's a pencil button. Yeah. Now.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Consider.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The business hours please? Okay. And before we get into it, we need to actually apply the business hour template. I'm sorry, I mean if you could take me to the settings and here from the none, let's set up the default and again go back to SLS. And now you get an option to select the business hours fair enough that's right now, any email coming in within the business hours will be actually triggered on the time basis that we have just defined like six hours or 48 hours. So those are the 48 business hours minded. If you want to shorten those, you can perhaps do that because you have a long business hours. I mean, eight hours today and then eight hours tomorrow. So we are okay to wait for two to three days until the ticket is closed. And I'm assuming this is exactly the business case, you have, it's not a shipment on Amazon. Hey, where's my packet? It's right there outside the door, right? So, we are closing the ticket and boom, no, it's a more subjective conversation you're having. So I think 48 hours are good enough right there. And apart from that, if you notice the auto responders here?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  This.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  is where you could trigger notifications, the auto responders, the fourth or fifth option. Yeah, this is where you could trigger the notification, exactly what you want to convey to your emails or the customers that are sending emails to this CS. At the rate. Now, you could say, whatever the template is. I mean, you can turn it on the top here and type in a template here. You can have for all the emails or as for the business hours, so emails coming in within the business hours and outside the business hours, you can always have two different templates that's absolutely your choice got.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  It, do you have a template that you can use here? There's… one on the customer service? I think Alex, would you clean? Okay? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I think it's right there. I can go ahead and maybe send you.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  So we'll need, we need two, one for during business hours and one found all emails received during business hours. So… one of these is going to be checked and one of this is going to be not checked, right? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Either you could say, you know, we want to send a technical, I mean, a response to all the emails and there you mention whatever the business hours are like Saturdays to Sundays to Mondays or whatever, right? Or you particularly say that anybody coming in within the business hours, hey, we are working nine to four or anybody coming outside the hours because by default, we have chosen those templates right now, any email which is coming at Sunday four a. M, we know that nobody's going to be working, right? So we can tell them that, hey, the very next reply you can expect is on Sunday evenings. So that's when we are starting. So, you have got choice to do both ways got.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  It. Okay. All right. We'll fill that this out.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. All right. Apart from that, if you notice the auto assignment now, this is something Patricia I would personally recommend because if the email volume is huge, let's say if you're dealing with a volume, you don't want to have one person looking at those umia emails and manually triaging or assigning or delegating them. I would rather say because all the folks are equally trained in your team, they all are okay to deal with all the emails. We're coming in today. You would simply turn on the auto assignment and hybrid will automatically round Robin these emails and say, first email get goes to assign to Victor. Second goes to cash, third goes to Pat. That's how the round Robin, equal distribution of workload would happen. Second use case could be where I'm not cherry picking these emails like I'm not smart enough to kind of just open the easiest emails and pick that up. And, I leave the difficult ones for the team. This is where, you know, it would really help us. And on top of it, let's say if Pat you don't want emails to be assigned to yourself, you can just simply say accept myself exclude myself on the round Robin, assign emails to each of, each member, we.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Got all new inbound conversation, exclude users. So we can, I'm not saying because he wanted to separate those terminals. So with the automatic assignment that wouldn't work, you know what I'm saying? If he wants to have the separate customer people working on each terminal, if the email will be assigned, what whatever is coming is going to the first available in person? Yeah. I mean, how are we going to decide that an email is part of SE term? I have, somebody will need to look at it. I mean… I think it's going to be hard to separate that one person, one terminal. I think this should be two, three people working all satellites and understanding also. I was thinking because I, I'm like there's no way to, I would somebody will have to sit open those emails you would. Yeah. And then, yeah. And so I would have to read all of them and then assign to the specific part person. So, so how would we handle that situation? You think? Is?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It, because the emails are very specific to certain terminals. Yes. Okay. I've got a solution here. Let's go to the auto automations. Now, this is irrespective of anything that's coming in, right? This is a whole lot of emails. When I'm looking at the volume. Now, when we are looking at a very specific emails that do come into your customer inbox, success, customer service inbox, and it talks about certain specific terminals. Now, this is a question for you. Pat, how do you determine that this customer email is about Portland terminal or this is for Florida terminal? There must be a code or some verbiage or some writing language in the email they.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Use usually, they just use the name the city name whereas so they use the like ontario if it's going to cut?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. Yeah. Fair enough. Add a step. Okay? Instead, could you write a notice? I mean automation name here? Like port bases or however you want to write that. I'm not very sure it's like.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  I'll do terminals?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Whatever terminals. Yeah, fair enough. Add a step. If condition, yeah, please select condition. The email subject… instead of is contains any of now, think of the different keywords your customers can send you these emails with. You. Don't have to do inverted commas, it's okay. Even if you just do, you know, the space enter, it should just simply, yeah. And now think of more such keywords. Ontario could be there. Do we have a code to it? Like CA? Okay. Yeah. Fair enough. Now condition or… the body of the email select body now contains any of now, think of the other conditions. Same, ontario, Canada, people can say, ontario's dash comma Canada, full term also, right? Okay. Yeah.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  We would have to add so many. Yeah, we don't know yet, but this is good. This is a good work. We can replicate this. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then now add step.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Huh. Action.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Assign it to assign action assigned to. Yeah, for now, we don't have users added to the hybrid account. They have not accepted the invite, but you could choose to say either it gets assigned to Pat or Rakesh, whoever has less emails or by default, you should just simply go to Rakesh. If he's away, then these emails should go to the unassigned folder. And Pat can actually choose manually who has to assign. Okay?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  That works.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Nice. Yeah. Now, this is just one quick example that we looked at. Now, think of these emails which are coming in outside the business hours, even then you could send them a quick notification even if there are certain emails where you have worked upon, but they have not responded back to you guys in about two days and you want to trigger a notification or a quick follow up email without manually doing a follow ups.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You can still choose to do all of those follow ups with the automations in hybrid. Okay. Like I contacted you for a quotation request, you gave me a quote and I ghosted for about two days instead of Pat opening up that email again manually or looking at the task, hybrid can automatically send a trigger email because when you sent me a quotation, you are not closing the case. You have put that in pending because you are expecting Rakesh to get back to you with the confirmation? Yes. No, maybe now, because Rakesh in two days have not gotten back to you, hybrid automatically triggers another email to Rakesh saying, hey, are you okay with the code? You need to talk on a phone call? And then it opens the email again for Patrycja and that's where we could expect a quick follow up on a specific sales related use case. I would say, okay.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  But would that apply to all the emails that they didn't reply or we can just,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  you could choose to yeah both ways. Any email that hasn't replied, but you are expecting a reply, you have choose chosen to keep them in pending and use the tag called sales code. It could trigger. If you do want these emails to be triggered, a notification, just on a very specific email, we define that specific email with that tag so that's possible.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  In that way, when we wait for the revised confirmation from the book, and then I responded instead of, you know, just sending, can you please let me know if this is, you know, approved? Can you send us your advice that there will be an automatic email that they will receive. So we do we get, we receive an email. I want to send them back an email. No, he's saying that the, I wouldn't have to send them another email asking for it after how many hours like 48 hours?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Whatever you decide you choose, even if you want to wait for three days or five days, hiver triggers an automatic notification here. Okay?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah, we can do that. Was that, would that be also be in here?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, it would be here. But again, are these like, what is the use case here? Are these the quotes emails or what was that use case? Patricia? What are these emails where you want to trigger these notifications? Like?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Revised confirmation? What does that mean? So basically, we gotta, we, what we gotta read confirmation? They're saying this, hey guys, we have some extra charges added after the load was booked. Okay? After it's delivered and we want them to approve those charges. Sometimes we send an email. Can you please let us know if it's approved for billing or not? And they not replying to us at all? So, after 48 hours, he's saying they would get another email. Can you please instead of me? No noting which, you know, which load I.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Mean, which is a manual task. Yeah, we can automate that fair enough. Let's let's go ahead and make a note automation, revise. Like what, what's the name here? Revise notification, revise?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Lumbar retention. So revise, we'll just say lumbar, maybe charges? Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let's copy this revised additional charges. Okay? Let's copy this as it is. And okay, for now, let's just go back and first of all, create a tag called revised charges because we want to make sure that we are triggering this automation on a very specific email that are tagged under revised charges, right? So let's go ahead into the hybrid front panel, the basic interface inside the tags. Okay? Now, you could create a tag from here itself or, yeah, just put in the tag name, revised charges, the, whatever you copied on the clipboard, just the whole thing.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And create a tag… and yeah, you don't have to literally apply it. It's fine. I mean, even if you do done, you can just undo the tagging. You just want to make sure that we are creating tags for you. And there are multiple ways to create tags. One, you can create a tag from here itself or otherwise, you can also create a tag under the, all views in the main section here. So… you see this tag is already there. Okay? And by the way, with regards to number of category of emails that you receive today, you can always create more tags which will definitely help your entire team, Patricia to define what this email is about. And let's say, if I only work on the emails about cancellations, you could say, Rakesh, you go ahead and pick all the cancellation emails. Let me just tag cancellation emails for you. If you say these are the urgent ones, it should be tagged urgent. And you can probably, you know, signify, I mean definitely create triage or organize those emails as per those category labels. Now, let's go back again to the admin interface… and create a quick automation… admin portal.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  We can auto assign tags based on the automation as well, right? Absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Automations… create an automation and give it a name, the same tag name, easier for us to remember. Okay? Now, as long as the email is coming in to the inbox, new email is coming in, add a step… condition. If the condition is that we have… not really time passed since… time passed since, and there is no external reply received on the emails for about, let's say 48 hours. OK, count in business hours if you want it and add another condition.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Here I would say… OK, could you, instead of coming, the email received in the inbox, can you drop down this one and add a tag is added? And the tag is added. Now select a condition. Again. So tag is tags… is any of… revised additional charge? And also, I want to make sure that the status also is not changed, add condition… select condition. The status… is pending… because by default, when you are working on this specific request pet, you're not closing the request, you are actually keeping that email in pending and adding a tag onto that email because only then you'll be able to track these emails into the pending folder with a very specific tag called revised additional charge. Now, what you want to do is scroll it down, maybe a little bit… scroll the page down. Add a step… condition. Yeah, action. I'm sorry, action, select action. Now, what do you want to do is send a reply… and this is where you could draft a generic response that, hey, we are waiting for your response. Haven't, been, we haven't heard back from you for about two days. Do you want to get on a quick phone call? Anything else we could do extra to help you? However you want to template that you could do that?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. Okay. We can do that later.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Can we?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Save and not enable or disable?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You can save. And yeah, absolutely. You can go ahead and disable that. Unless you know, you want to just simply get live with this one. Yeah, on basis of the tags, like you said, Victor, yes, you can even have automations running where emails are coming in with a very specific subject content. If these do contain a specific keywords in body, you can automatically tag those emails, automatically close those emails. For an example. I keep sending you emails about discounts. You know, the cash is going to be spamming me tomorrow. You can just simply say any email coming in from xyzdomain. Com, hiver automatically close that email and mark them spam. So you don't have to work on the notifications, xyz emails as such.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  All right. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Apart from that, we looked at the auto assignment, custom fields. Now, there's something called AI. I mean, do you want to play around with the AI or is that something you want to look at it later? By the way you can automatically, hiver can automatically understand the emails.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  So, this is going to be an additional 20 dollars per user, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's right?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. I don't think we're going to probably use that at least for now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You still want to try that test that in the trial, you're not going to be paying anything in the trial, but yeah.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  This is AI tagging. So we will create tags and it will automatically try to assign a tag, right? That's right? So it will process the email that's incoming and give us some sort of understanding of what.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Happy, sad neutral emails, customers frustrated would escalate, give it a Smiley, which is a red angry Smiley. You'll be able to categorize emails, how many of them are sad customers on Fridays? And you can process those emails, then there are thank you detectors.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  So this is basically, if they say, thank you, it doesn't create a new ticket.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It just automatically closes for you and that is AI co pilot. Now that's very special. I would say that this is more like your repetitive nature of queries, get drafts automatically, hiver able to understand the email and helps agents to draft those emails. Appropriately. Now, these drafts can happen through your knowledge base articles. Like all the faqs. You can always, you know, you could define the knowledge sources and from there, hiver could try and fetch all of the relevant information. Now, before agent writes the email, it can just ask hiver to write an email for you. They can maybe, you know, simply go ahead and proofread the email and say this is a good to go. And then you would be able to send that email across your customers.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. I mean, it's absolutely fine. I mean, in the beginning, I would always say let's start small. Let's start with basic let's add more users, let's try and see first of all, delegate those emails, try to work out of these inboxes. We are anyways going to be having a new check in meeting. And of course, next week, we can have a quick 15 minute catch up to look at the progress. And by then if you decide to say Victor, we want to turn on certain AI, let's see if this can actually help operationally bring in more efficiency. We can test AI for a couple of more days. Should not be a challenge. I think let's not turn on everything in the go and let's not confuse everybody.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Sounds good. That works.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Anything else in particular to show? I mean, can you think of more use cases?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  I think for now, we are good. We're just going to see how it's working. We'll add everybody in there because right now we can have everybody theoretically, we have unlimited users, right? So we can add as many people as we want.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, and more shared mailboxes, even if you want to have crossover on certain inboxes for different users, go ahead and add more couple of inboxes so that different people can actually test hiver in different mailboxes, and every mailbox setting is limited to one inbox here. So once you have more shared mailboxes, you can have more advanced functionalities in that specific mailbox.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, if you don't have any more questions, I think that looks like a good plan to move ahead with it, I will go ahead and maybe have a quick follow up meeting on Wednesday, if that's okay with you, Victor… or do we want to connect on here?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  I'm here. I think let's see… Wednesday. How about between one and three P. M or before 11?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me check that. Give me one minute.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah, we can do like nine 30 a M.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Give me one minute. Just checking my diary.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  I'm not going anywhere anytime soon.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  We got a time call.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. That works for me. Nine. I am sending an invite to you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You have the access to edit the invite, Victor, feel free to add Patricia as well. And even if you have the entire team added to your hiver, and they also want to just quickly go through a quick training, user interface training, would love to do that for you. Okay. Do you see the invite in your inbox already?

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Yeah. Got it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Lovely. Should you need any further assistance, right from your hiver inbox, you have got an option to chat with our support team, just like yours. We also work 24 or seven even during even, you know, morning breakfast. On Sunday, you come across a question, you want to talk to somebody in the team, you can start a chat with us that's even more proactive. We've got a SLA of no more than four hours for email response and no more than four seconds on live chat. So, feel free to use that. We've got knowledge base which is help serve documents which is available 24 or seven for you, like a friend for you for 24 or seven. Otherwise I'm still the point of contact. Should you come across any more questions, Victor, feel free to write back to me. We're going to be talking to you on Wednesday from now.

Viktor Voskovsky (viktor@gotologistics.net):
  Sounds good. Thank.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
