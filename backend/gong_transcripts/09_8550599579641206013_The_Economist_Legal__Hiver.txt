Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Alex, hi, can you hear me?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Alex? I'm not able to hear you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Still, can't hear you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Not that great at lip reading, but I think you're figuring out your audio control. So I give it to settle down, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  The aunties here, Brasilia's joining in as well. We're recording on Sarah and Gianna. Hey, auntie, can you hear me? Hi. Yeah. Hi. Okay, Sarah's, here.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Where are you based? I'm.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  based out of India from a city called Chennai down south.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  And what time is it there?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It's about nine. I can just turn nine in the night.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  Oh, same, same. Thank you. It's nine for me as well.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  are you also like logging in from India? Auntie by any chance?

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  No, I'm in Sri Lanka. Oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sri Lanka. All right. Pretty close then. Same time zone, at least.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. We've got, hey, Sarah. Hey, Priscilla, Alex, I think is still trying to get his audio up and running. We've been at it for a couple of minutes team, any word from Gianna in terms of her?

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  Probably join shortly all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Cool.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Oh, that's fine.

Alex Mackenzie (alexandermackenzie@economist.com):
  She'll join shortly there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We go, Alex. Yes, we can hear you now.

Alex Mackenzie (alexandermackenzie@economist.com):
  Amazing. Thank you. Brilliant. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We'll just give a couple of minutes for Gianna to join in as well, just to set a quick agenda in terms of what to expect on today's. Call. We've blocked ourselves for like 30 minutes, so my intention was to understand a bit more of your workflows, your needs, your challenges, high level, whatever you feel would be meaningful to surface or talk about, give you like a really brief, really high level overview of general hiver functionality, set up some time for a detailed deep dive based on what we discussed today, so we can get into more of a tailored demonstration of hiver, talk about the specific features as we plan ahead for next steps and implementation… perfect. Okay?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Gojira is here as well. I think that will house from the economist side of things. Hey, Gianna. Can you hear us or hear me?

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  Yes. Sorry, I was in another meeting, sorry.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You're good… Gianna. I was just setting a quick agenda at the top for the team. So just to sort of recap that, Gianna, I'd like to spend maybe 10, 15 minutes understanding your workflows where you're coming from what you're looking for, potentially what hiver can solve for. And then the second part of the call, I'd like to give the team a quick brief overview of the product in itself very high level. And what I'd ideally like to do is set us some time for maybe a 45 minute or one hour discussion. We'll take the learnings from today's, call, dive deeper into specific functionality. So the whole team knows what daily life is going to look like workflow wise. And then we'll plan next steps in terms of implementation and training from there. Brilliant. All right. Quick round of introductions. If everybody doesn't mind, I'm Raghav, I've been with the hiver business for about eight years now. I take care of the account management motion currently, and I've been working with Ben initially. And now, Daphne of recent times with the economist in terms of the hiver partnership, we do have a success manager dedicated for the hiver economist relationship. Unfortunately, he's not able to join us today, but will be part of future discussions as we go ahead. So, yeah, pleasure meeting everybody. If we could, you know, passing it back to the group, a quick one or two line introduction about yourself and your role would be really helpful.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  So, I'm Yana planiotti, and I'm the head of illegal contracting in the economist and I'll pass on to ayanthi.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  Hi, I'm ayanthi and I managed the inbox. And yeah, I'll pass on to Alex.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  You're muted, Alex?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thanks.

Alex Mackenzie (alexandermackenzie@economist.com):
  Yeah. I'm Alex, I work under Yana as a legal counsel at the economist sort of dealing with contracts mainly. And yeah, helping ayanthi with the inbox as well.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hi.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  I'm Sarah.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  Oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  sorry, go.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  Ahead. Go ahead, Sarah.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Thank you. I'm Sarah, I'm senior legal counsel from the New York office. It's next month is my fourth year anniversary here. Working with this team doing it all. And Priscilla go ahead, yeah.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  I'm Priscilla, I'm part of Yana's team and I'm based in London, but I look after our Asia team.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay, pleasure meeting everybody. Yes, sorry, Diana. So.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  we are all based in London apart from Sarah who is in New York.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's just got it. Makes sense. All right. It's a great meeting everybody. It looks like we do have people handling different parts of the legal team as a whole, contracting inboxes and everything. So to kick us off, I would love to hear three things. Primarily one is how does the inbox or the system work today? In terms of communication? What kinds of email conversations do you typically have? You know, with vendors? Is it with internal stakeholders, things like that? And what is the tool that you use right now to collaborate and work together on emails?

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  Who wants to, I?

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Can, unless you want to Yana?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, Sarah, please. Okay.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  So, we use, we have a shared legal contracts inbox. We all use Gmail. It used to be that most of what we work on is internal client facing working with helping sales people with their client agreements, but we get all kinds of requests from also working with vendor on vendor agreements. HR. The, the gamut used to be that every request would just be funneled to the legal contracts inbox. And then a auntie would like triage it some, she could handle some, she would assign to one of us or she would say this isn't for us. This is for the tax team. Say that kind of thing. Now, we've started in the last year using DocuSign to have sales teams create agreements and send us requests to review through DocuSign. But that doesn't always work. And so we also, and so it doesn't always attach all the information we need. So we still use the inbox to supplement that… understood.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. And from what I'm hearing it's all general Gmail and forwarding and everything out of the box that you're using to like, you know, for the whole system. Yeah.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  And we use the legal contracts inbox as like kind of a first place to search for history with a client.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood now, considering you're all working out of Gmail. I'm sure there's to some extent a level of categorization that you follow labels, colored stars, folders, things like that. When.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  we, about a year ago or more, we exceeded our maximum. I think it's like 50,000 like labels. Yeah. So basically any client who's come to us in the last year is unlabeled. It's impossible to search. It's a huge inbox. Yeah, makes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  sense. Yeah, sorry, go ahead. Just.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  To add here… it's a very busy, I just want to make like these points, it's a very busy inbox with a lot of on. So we have a lot of new requests coming in. So all requests go into that inbox. So we have two points that we need to address first that there is a lot of busy, a busy day per day inbox with a lot of requests coming in. So, and the second point is that we may have one for example line of communication email chain that can be very long with repeated emails. So one of, the points that I would like the system to see if it can address is whether if you have another email, a lot of stakeholders want to say is that we may start a new email chain… and about the same matter and whether there would be a sophistication, a certain level of certification there to capture that this is the same matter. Let's bring this together and it's not a certain, a separate matter. So one, one of the aspects that we would like for example, to tackle, in the inbox, which would also enable the search. The search is at the moment inexistent. We cannot find it's. Like sometimes you find things, sometimes you don't whether there is a way, one, of the aspects we are looking into is whether there is, in a new ideal system, whether there is a way of system systematic search of finding items. So that's.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  makes sense. Got it. So, yeah, at the top, hiver can definitely help address one, the scaling part of your categorization as a whole, we probably need to rethink that a bit if I can call it that or maybe reset it in terms of a more robust system with hiver. But yes, to your point of you need the categories to keep the whole thing running. We can look at a tier level of categorization where we say, hey, a bunch of these are just sales contracts and then we further break it down saying, you know, new sales renewals, things like that and we pretty much go at it from there that's effectively how I'm envisioning it in terms of search obviously with better categorization, and with some of the additional tools that hiver brings to the table, searching, an email is no longer going to be purely reliant on putting in their email address and looking for it, right? You can have multiple avenues where emails are indexed and categorized. So you can search for it beyond just via an email address. Can I?

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Stop you there. Yeah, please. I think the problem Yana was saying is we might have an internal client that sends a request for us to redline an agreement and he assigns it to Alex. He sends back a red line in. And then a month later, the client responds asks for us to re review it, but the salesperson sends it back on a new email chain without saying Alex already reviewed this. So the second draft gets assigned to me. I don't know the history and because Google search is terrible if the company is named something generic, you can never find it again.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. Now, from that perspective, again, hiver does have just being feature naming here. At this point, we have something called a contact module which would pretty much tie every interaction you're having to an email address that's on the thread. But in this case, you know, that'll apply when you're doing external communication, right? You're directly talking to the vendor or the client, we can track it based on that. Now, based on your internal mechanisms, if a sales Guy forwarding stuff follows up in two months, saying, hey, we need to look at the contract again, we can still look at either an automated categorization mechanism where we can use to track. All right, we've done this already for this client or this name of the business. And hence here's the past of those conversations. So there are definitely a couple of avenues that I can think of that we will be spending a lot of time on during the onboarding phase or the implementation phase. But yes, long story short, definitely doable. And it's no longer just reliant on searching or trying to find it from memory at the end of the day, right? Another thing that I wanted to find out unless the team has more to add is from an everyday handling perspective. Another way I'm hearing this is email comes in ayanti pretty much runs through the context or the summary of the email, gets an idea on who in the team should be handling it, adds a label for the client name and the type of email it is. And then gets it to that person. What typically happens after, you know, no.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  I don't add a label. Oh yeah. Sorry. I don't add a label. Oh, you don't add a label? Okay. No, I just have a look at what type it is or like what kind of matter it is, and then decide who gets it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And so once you know, who gets it, do you like forward it internally as of today?

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  No, just like CC them in, oh.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got. It. Makes sense. So you bring them on the actual thread and that's how people know I need to take care of this. It sits in my inbox. Got it understood. And so after somebody gets it, just a quick very second in terms of what the team typically does there.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  So, whoever gets it. So we sorry you.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  Go again review.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  It, and just be in touch with the stakeholder or the client and that's how we work on the email fund.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So when it comes to?

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  Can I just clarify here? So let's say the matter is assigned to me. What happens is that the email is forwarded from the legal inbox to me. So it comes as a new email into my inbox. And then I take the matter forward and I copy legal inbox. So it's on record there, but I do it for my email if that's so that's how it's handled. So it's both in my inbox and the legal inbox.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood makes sense. And the one final question before I start showcasing the platform, you know, giving you more visual context on how hiver would work is in terms of handling times as a whole, what I'm trying to understand is depending on the type or the category of email you're receiving, is there an expectation to handle this faster? Trying to see if there's any kind of prioritization you'd like to have on these emails? I.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  mean it depends like on how complex it is, if it's like a simple agreement on our paper, then we try to, we try to get back to every single person within a day. But in terms of like getting back work, it depends on whether it's on our template and how complex it is and how many red lines there are. So if it's on our template and it's not complicated. Usually we like to get back to them one day if not two to three working days. It's just something complicated. So that's perfect.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thanks for that. Dayanti that pretty much answers what I was looking for. So that's all the questions at least for the time being folks. I'm going to start sharing my screen. Let me know when you can see my Gmail inbox. And we'll start talking about some of the topics we discussed and how hiver will be able to handle that. Is my screen up. Yeah. All right, perfect. Brilliant folks. So this is what the hiver environment looks like fully fleshed out scaled and built out across multiple departments and teams. And everything in your case, you're going to probably see about 30 percent of the volume on my screen in terms of emails and the number of inboxes and everything just taking you from the top. In terms of the experience, hiver comes bundled as a Chrome extension for Gmail. So everybody would begin logging into Gmail under their individual economist aliases, get the extension installed, and that would immediately pop two changes for you inside of Gmail visual cues, right? First, is you're going to start seeing this little bell and this little hiver logo, top, right? That's going to tell you hiver is active and is connected to your Gmail account. Now, all of your contract emails, the legal contract alias that's going to be bundled into a shared inbox as we call it on the left side. So support operations info. These are all different email addresses of groups that we have that I'm using on my sandbox here. In your case, you'll only see one there that says legal contracts, legal depending on how you name it. And with that said in terms of an everyday experience perspective, what pretty much happens is that going forward, ayanti does not need to monitor her regular Gmail inbox, nor does she need to keep an eye on every email that comes in. Instead you're all now gonna start getting these views as we call it basically different cues depending on where that email is in being processed.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  So, sorry, can we, I wanna back up because if John smith at economist emails, legal contracts like that's where we start from. So like. And then I think like the legal contracts inbox will be the admin that decides how it gets tracked or assigned through hiver. Is what I, how I see this working?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just a small change there is that any email that enters legal contracts, the inbox would immediately show up inside this unassigned view across the hiver, to everybody who.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  gets the legal contracts.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Who gets the hiver access for the.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  But, so we don't get the legal contracts. Emails do not get forwarded to all of us. We have all have access to that as a separate, true, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. Okay. It's a good way of looking at it, yeah.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  No, but I mean, that's how it is now. Yeah, legal contracts emails are not forwarded to us. It's a second. All of them shared. Yeah. So.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  That's currently, everyone on the legal team has access to the legal inbox.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So,

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  we can just, but they don't come… but they don't come to our, they don't the emails, not every single email comes to our inbox, our personal inbox. So here, we don't need any single email come to each one's personal inbox. Yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, I think that's still the question. Thanks for breaking that down team. So even with hiver, your regular Gmail inbox is not going to get a copy of everything sent to legalads. Instead, what happens is all of you will get to see those emails inside this hiver view, specifically, the inside view, right? Okay. You will be able to see the legal emails from your Gmail account, but it's not going to clutter your Gmail inbox. Your personal inbox stays for your direct emails that you need to handle. At the same time, everybody on the team, full visibility can see the open queue inside the unassigned email is sent to legalads immediately shows up in unassigned for all of you at the same time, right? So that's how we make sure you can see the emails, but it's not polluting your Gmail inbox and you're not losing track of everything that you don't need to handle, basically, right? So with that said, what typically happens within a Gmail inbox, and I'm guessing this is probably where ayanti would be taking the lead is go into the unassigned check out the queue of emails that you've received, right? And what she can effectively do is either, and if you're doing this manually, this is how we'd be doing it. Basically check the email, you know, who's supposed to be handling it instead of replying with a CC or forwarding or anything of that sort. Ayanti can just use this hiver panel on the right side and say, okay, this one goes to Aditya, right? This one goes to Priscilla. This one goes to Alex and so on and so forth. And so that simple action of assigning it from a drop down does two things firstly the person that gets the email assigned to them, or the person that needs to handle the email, they see that email in the mind view, right? So it goes into.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  before?

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  Something straightforward or like whatever it is. Like, I just do it without even assigning it to myself because I'll be like that's a quick thing for me to deal with. Got it. So, are you saying now I'll have to assign everything to myself?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Assignments are not mandatory in that sense if that's the way, you know, you'd like to handle it, ayanti because what you can do with hiver is that assignment is just a clear route of saying this is now this person's task or ownership and that's pretty much where you can and need to use assignment. If it's just a quick question, you know, what you should be saying and you can reply, you can just reply without being assigned to an email. And so, if.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  John smith said like forwards an email from a client that doesn't have info and ayanti needs to say, what are you asking of us? Does the email come from her or can it still come from legal contracts? It?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Can always come from legal contracts. It does not come from her. So, for, and this applies to all of you. So while you're logging into Gmail and activating hiver from Gianna at, or Sarah at, the replies that you send out, can all come from legal at legal contracts, at whatever you prefer. And that distinction can be maintained automatically as well. Meaning you reply to an email sent to you directly. It's going to come from, you reply to anything from the legal contracts. It's going to come from legal contracts, all within the hiver and the Gmail interface of yours.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  When somebody gets an email, it will say it's been sent via hiver, right? Sorry. So if somebody, when somebody gets an email from us, it will send it's, been sent via hiver.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, there's no watermark. There's nothing of that sort. So the email interaction experience is gonna stay the same. It's just for your team of 14, 15 people that are gonna be using hiver that you even know hiver exists outside of that, the standard email does not change, you know, visually, there's no watermark, there's no line that says sent by hiver. None of it, it's gonna look like a normal email exchange.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  Would our internal stakeholders know that who on the legal team is replying to the emails?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You will be able to do that as well. So just to give you a quick reference point on how this will happen is we'll basically again, this will be something that we help you with during the onboarding phase, but typically we help you set up something like this. So it'll have your first name, last name depending on how you'd want it to read. But the email address that the correspondent happens from would be legal at economist. Com or legalcontracts at economist. Com. That's one thing we can do. We can also set up a matching signature. So both in the name of the email address and the signature, it will show the individual in the team who's doing that exchange. But the email id is always gonna be the team address, not your personal one if that helps.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  I think at the moment, we don't need to go into these details if possible. Could you please, for example, can you now send an email to the hiver inbox and then someone on the team can pick up that request?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, they can. So if I were to send a new email, it's gonna show up in this, you know, let me just pick a different on site view. Yeah. So if I were to send a new email to my inbox, it's gonna show up and be part of this queue. And these are all emails that need to be picked up or handled. Now, anybody on the team can pretty much go here, check out the email. And if they wanna take it on as their task or their ownership, they can either do the assignment if they prefer to. If not, they can just click on reply, type out the response, send it out and effectively move on to the next conversation.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  Does this mean that everyone on the legal team will have full access to the list of the tasks and they need to take a look at all the tasks because we don't want everyone to review all the tasks. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  From a general product perspective, it does open up full visibility just like how you're doing with sharing the passwords in that case right now, if you were to log into legal act, you would be able to see all the emails. But the way we would be handling this is from ensuring the setup happens well to the level of we create a custom view for like this for Priscilla. So Priscilla does not need to see everything the team is doing. So she goes to hiver. It only shows you your conversations and your relevant tasks in terms of emails as a whole. But when needed, you could check on what the whole team is doing, what tasks others have. So that way, you know, if there's ptos you wanna step in for somebody or you're just pulled in for like a quick assistance that is also available there. So.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  How would the system? Sorry, maybe silly, but how would the system know which one is my task? Which one is Sarah's task? Which one is inc's task that's a?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Good question. Again, so that depends on the assignment logic as a primary thing. So like ayanthi said, if she decides and realizes this email needs to be handled by Priscilla, she would go in and do that assignment of that email to your team. So afterwards, once emails are assigned, you get a single view where you see these are my team members, this is the ownership for that relevant email. So this one's Cole's, this one's Lucas, so on and so forth. So you're always gonna have that visibility once you assign it or if you assign it, does that help?

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  So what happens when a task is done? Does it disappear it?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Does the whole queue that I'm showing you so far? Are all active tasks?

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  Where does it go then? Good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Question. So we track it using something called a status and that's kinda like archiving it from your inbox in Gmail, right? So once you're done handling a task and that could be when you're replying or at the later stage manually, you've got the status on the right side if you're not doing an action and you just wanna move it as done when you're sending a reply and you know, this is the end of it, send them close. What happens in terms of the experience is the email goes to this view called closed. So it stays there?

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  Yes.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Are there options that we could add more types of categories? We?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Can definitely help you set up in terms of stages of progress of that email. I'm guessing you're coming from this is now with sales, we're waiting on the ae to reconfirm things like that, right? Yeah, we can definitely help you set up things like that. There's additional ways in which you can do it. So the way, yes, Gianna, may.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  I ask when the status is closed, let's say I've dealt with a matter and it's closed and I select the close, right? I am the one who defines that. Okay, it goes closed. Then if I search, I go back and then the stakeholder sends another email and I'm trying to find now whether we've dealt with this matter. Will the search engine go into the closed matters?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's a good question. So search is universal. It will go across every part of hiver, irrespective of assignment or status. If an email is illegal, hiver is going to have it. And when you search it's going to give you everything at the same time. If it's a follow up email on a closed thread, like you send a follow up or you receive a follow up on a closed email, the system automatically reopens, it.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  Retains. Okay, good.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  But if only reopens it if it's the same if.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Joe.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Smith replied to the same thread, he might be replying something new.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  The thing is most of the time they don't stick to the same chain and that's the issue.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. So, for the look back or new chains of conversations, this was that contact module piece that I was talking about. So you, for every person you now start interacting with on email, there's going to be this one module that you can click on and that'll tell you all the past conversations as a team you've handled across the board with?

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  That specific person?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Or with that domain or company, it's going to tell you what is the status of that last email date and timestamp and it's all one click access. You click on it. It actually opens up the thread as well.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  So, does it give you a kind of list or do you have to look into the system or can you just press a button saying, give?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Me. So you open an email, this little yellow page looking icon and that's the whole list. Okay? This is for.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  The team too. If I set mark something closed and Yana needs to find it two months later, she's still seeing it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. It's irrespective of status, irrespective of who it's assigned to or how it's categorized. If it's an email that's in the legal inbox from this person's, email address, that history shows up completely here. Same way for anything that's closed across the team, quick filter. You know, it was assigned to Sarah last time and you want to find it. Just go there and you're like, hey, show me all of Sarah's emails that were marked as closed. I'm sorry, didn't realize your name wasn't part of our sandbox, but basically, that's the route you'd be taking. Go here and be like, okay, show me all of this person's emails that were categorized or labeled as X, y and Z. You know, different stages of additional categorization. So, like I said, you're waiting on a support team waiting on the sales vendor confirmation, a lot of those could be configured, and all of those become filters for you to use when you're searching.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Can we have it triggered? So hiver is only activated when an email comes to legal contracts and not if it comes to us individually.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's how the system works by default. So only if the legal contract address is in the two CC or BCC field, does that email even enter hiver, anything and everything outside of it is purely private, just for your eyes. None of the team will even know.

Ayanthiperera (ayanthiperera@economist.com):
  that someone sends it to our personal email, you just CC it and then it should go to hiver. Yeah, cool. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  CCS, bccs forwards and direct emails to legal ads will all enter hiver. Any email that does not fit that criteria, does not show up in hiver. It will be private between the people that are exchanging it.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  Yeah. Does the system give any analytics? Like for example they give you? Like I want to see how many matters closed last year, high level.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. So you get two types of analytics on hiver, full detailed reporting, all kinds of metrics and data points you need. But from a quick consumption wish relief perspective, you do have quick access dashboards. You can build out that'll tell you email volume handling times, active conversations. You can flesh it out as much as you need category level, person level all of it. And you can go one at a time and drill down as specific as you need. So to your point, Gianna, just quickly running an example, I want to see how many backlogs we've handled as a team date range within business hours that's your entire scale there volume of conversations times. And if you've got any additional features enabled, all of that. And the depth of it obviously goes right down to this email one handling time, how many exchanges, all of that. So you can definitely build out quite a lot more and be as granular as you want with the data you're looking to track. But the capability to support reporting even information at a glance does exist with hiver.

Alex Mackenzie (alexandermackenzie@economist.com):
  Am I right in saying? Sorry, is that something we'd have to build out internally? So we would probably need some support to build out that capacity or is that something that comes with a certain, you know, a module? Good?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Question? So this that you see on my screen, this list of conversations right down to csat SLA, that's out of the box. So whatever I'm showing you or seeing on my screen that's out of the box, you don't need to do anything extra. Once your email volume starts, the numbers start filling in dashboards and custom reports will be partnered with the success managers. You'll always have the hiver support to build it out to help you in building it out or assist you in terms of this, how you get it going, right? So, yeah, from our support and our setup perspective, you're going to have three resources with hiver as we progress the conversation. One's going to be between me and your dedicated success manager. You'll always have one central point of contact from account setup to initial workflow, building automations, alerts, reminders, follow ups, all of that stuff from an ongoing basis. You also have access to a 24 seven live chat support with the hiver technical team. Sorry, anybody on the team go there, pop a message. Our team is ready to like start the conversation and help you out with what you need. So you've got both of those alongside white glove onboarding and training assistance.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  Can I ask, where are the contracts we saved?

Alex Mackenzie (alexandermackenzie@economist.com):
  So, I think to clarify that question, I think usually one of the good things about the inbox that we have at the moment is that if you search for something, you can go into an email and find an attachment related to a particular contract which might give you the context that you need to take the task forward. So I'm guessing that if an email contains an attachment or if it's put that into an email that's in this system, that you'd be able to locate that within hiver. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Anytime anytime. So, everything you're getting in Gmail in the legal ad contracts inbox right now, all of that will flow in and will continue being available when you use hiver along with obviously a bit more refinement and better ways on some of the pitfalls you're having. But from a general experience perspective, you get to see all the emails. If it has an attachment, you can pull it up. All of that stays the same. Nothing changes on that experience side of it, right? What will be different is, obviously, yes, sorry, Sarah, go ahead, I.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Wanted to ask about, you know, the legal contracts inbox predates all of us joining the economist. It was created in 2019. So we use it for like historical context. And I'm wondering about like since we've already hit our number of tags that Google allows, and we still need to be able to search that history, like.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  What's.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  going to happen?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Here. Yeah, I think I understand it. So there's two things we can do when you start with hiver. Now, we do support a paid old email, import, a historical email import process where, you know, if you say, hey, we need the last one year or two year worth of data, we can bring that to the hiver interface so that it shows up. We need, we.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Need forever. We are attorneys. So we need everything. Yeah, completely.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Doable. So as far back as you need depending on the volume and how many people would be part of hiver, the cost of it might differ. But bottom line is as functionality, again, we can definitely bring in any number of old emails, make it available inside of the hiver experience or instance. So that way you get that same experience of pull back an email from six months ago or six years ago, and you'd still be able to see it.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  But what's the difference?

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  The tags issue? Like we can't create any new tags. So I don't yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So when it comes to the tags is what I meant by, we need to probably rethink that just a little bit. I just apologies team. I'm probably a little late for my other meeting. So, I do realize that at least for now we've got the conversation started and I love the way the team's thinking what I'd like to, sorry.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  Can I ask one last question? Yeah, sorry, what's the difference between hiver and other contracts management platforms?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Could you tell me one platform that you're probably thinking about or referring to?

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  No… can I, this is not a context management, right? Maybe another ticketing system. Yeah. Like Jira, whatever that name is, Jira, Zendesk.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Front helpdesk, Freshdesk, zoho. I.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  think that's what Priscilla that's what you're yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So that's more along the lines of what hiver does, contact management or CRM as a whole. We do have integrations. We can do just because of what you said, you work with sales teams. So I'm sure. Is it Hubspot? If I remember correctly that you use or Salesforce?

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  Salesforce? And DocuSign?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Salesforce? And DocuSign. All right. So we can definitely take an integration to a place where we can show you the Salesforce panel. You tell us, hey, we need to see these fields in Salesforce. When I open an email, we can connect the two, get that going. So when Priscilla opens an email, I've got hiver, one button, you swap out and you see the Salesforce fields you want to see both of that could be part of the same experience for you. So we do have integrations as well. I hope that helps. All right. Thank.

Alex Mackenzie (alexandermackenzie@economist.com):
  You so much.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thanks, team. Gianna. I am. Oh, yeah. Sorry.

SarahOConnor (sarahoconnor@economist.com):
  I just said, sorry for keeping.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You, no worries. You're good, Gianna. We'll send you an email a bit later today, if you could use that or let me know about like four to five minute to one hour slots for next week that works. Okay? We'll set a longer time to make sure everything is addressed and we talk in detail before we go from there, yeah.

Priscilla Yu (priscillayu@economist.com):
  Thank you. Yeah, we do need a second.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  100 percent don't worry.

Gianna Plainioti (giannaplainioti@economist.com):
  Thank you. Bye.
