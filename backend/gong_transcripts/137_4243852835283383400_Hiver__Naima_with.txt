Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Neymar. Can you hear me?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Hello? Yeah, I can hear you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hi. How are you doing?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  I'm doing great. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm doing good. I'm doing good, Neymar. I'm Raghav with hiver, I'm going to be your host for today's, meeting, and I will be working with you in helping you understand more about hiver. I noticed that you had booked the meeting with interest on exploring the AI side of hiver before we begin. Could I have the email address you use with your hiver account?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, it's Neymar fakri at modern tech?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Can you spell that out for me please?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, N a IM a dot F a KHRI?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, the domain, please. Sorry?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, at M o DERN dot tech TECH?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Just give me one minute because I was trying to find your account and I couldn't locate it.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, I'm so sorry, I'm so dumb. I booked it with a personal account. I couldn't find it in my calendar and then I realized I booked it with the wrong person.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. Neymar. You're good to go. I've got your, yep. I see that you're on hiver's pro with like five inboxes and like three people in the team, right?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. Perfect. So, before we kick off the discussion and I show you an overview of what hiver's AI site can do. Could you maybe give me like a couple of minutes quick overview in terms of how you're using hiver today as it stands?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah. I'm gonna share my screen so you can see it. Can you see it?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just a sec. Yep. I can see your screen now.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  So, I'm sorry about this. Yeah, no.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Worries?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  I think we have been using it since I think September and I don't think we're using it the right way. Okay? So we set up a few automations of like the slas, and then automations related to let's say if it's like API related, then it's a VIP client and if it's coming from certain domain, then it's xyz those are working. Fine. The problem is that I don't think I need to create automations for tagging because there's a separate AI for that, right? You have a separate tool for that. So I was trying to set that up. I'm sorry. Just a second.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Take your time. Sorry. No, it's okay. Take your time. No rush.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  So this AI tagging, I really don't understand how am I supposed to set it up? And this thank you detector is also not working. And another problem that I'm facing is that I tried to, for example, I've been trying to… create Asana tickets from here because it would be a lot easier rather than going to a separate form. Yeah. But the problem is it's not letting me customize my phone. And what I'm doing here is I just go to my Asana and then copy the link and I then attach it to my link, but that just beats the entire purpose of automating things. So I wanted to know if there's a way I can, there is a way I can create tickets from here, but then those are not the fields that I want. Plus it doesn't allow attachment and it has a character limit on the description. Usually my, see, this is my descriptions are very long and it doesn't allow me, it has a character limit. So that's one of the issues that I'm facing and I was thinking of using zapier between Asana and hiver because I checked that it allows integration between the two. But I was wondering if there's like a better way to do it. And I.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  think, yeah, no, that makes sense. I do want to set the agenda and the context pretty clear. I'm not with the support team. So I'm not entirely sure if I can help you entirely with all of the issues and everything it's your facing, right? I'm with the account management team. I take care of the team here. Excuse me. So what I can do is maybe talk a little bit about the AI tagging. Yeah, the AI thank you detector that you'd mentioned, see what that looks like? And, you know, discuss commercials because obviously that's now tied to a time based trial, see what that looks like. And in parallel, I can put you in like basically initiate a conversation with the support team or you can drop a chat with them to check out the Asana side of things and we can run that.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Also, I wanted to ask about what does it mean? If the trial ends, then what happens? If everything that I have configured so far, would it also expire? And what would I be paying for this?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Definitely. So starting with the commercials on the clarity front, the AI add on every single piece of AI feature that you see on hiver is all bundled into a 20 dollar per user per month add on, right?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  And I can, if there are three users, can I get it just for one user? Like would the?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I know that won't be possible. It will be for the whole subscription as it stands. Makes sense. Yeah. Do you think that's feasible from like a commercial and a revenue standpoint? I.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Think it should be, but yeah, I'm not sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Alright. Fair enough. Okay. So what I want to do first is effectively try to help you with the AI tagging side of things.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And considering you've been exploring it, why don't you click on configure and I'll give you an idea on how to go about getting it done and what it effectively does when it starts working, right? So, yeah, what you're seeing here is basically the training module for the AI tagging as a whole. Long story short. The AI tagging is basically meant to replace automation workflows especially when it comes to probabilistic scenarios of adding a tag. Now, the reason I say that is because with the workflows on hiver, you can pretty much set up straightforward matches and have the tags associated. In this case, you're trying to do a feature request. And so what that means is effectively, if somebody mentions the word feature request, add the feature request tag. Now that's typically how you would go about setting up an automation rule that's based on keywords and phrases, the AI tagging that you're looking at here?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Makes sense. But what if I don't like this tag, I should remove it from my learning or can I give it a new tag?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, you can remove it from the learning. So the part that you're looking at here that says learning is basically you telling the AI. Hey, when I say feature request as a tag, these are the emails that I mean it should apply to. So if you feel this is wrong, you can just remove it from learning. And what you would typically need to do is go to your hiver inbox, like your shared mailbox, right? Firstly, before you jump around, can you go to hiver, AI as a whole on the left side? Yeah. And if you notice on the top right, just scroll up a bit because you have multiple inboxes, this is important. So make sure you've got the correct mailbox selected when you're setting up the tagging, right? So now, can you go back to that inbox on Gmail, the source re, support?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. All right. Go there? Any emails, right? New email, old email, whatever be the case, what you will need to do is pick 10 emails and add the feature request tag manually. If you feel the auto fetching isn't doing an accurate job? Yeah.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  We have tagged almost all of our emails. Can you see that this is billing? This is, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So then let's go back to the other one. I mean, let's go back to the AI admin console. Yeah. All right. Select configure against the tagging part and click on add tags on the top right… now. Can you select the tags that you actively use? Yeah, for instance, billing API seems to be the most common ones. Any and all, like if you want to add more, feel free to add more.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, this is gender equality.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And you can type the search as well. All right. Peaceful, click on add tags. Okay. We'll give it a minute so that the list loads up. All right. Now, click on any one like click on billing for instance or API, whichever you feel is easier. Yeah. And that's how you start training the AI at this point, right? So what you need to do is considering your existing emails are already tagged, you can either remove those and just re, add the tags. Again. Now that you've got the tag included in the training model, you can just pick emails, filter it by billing for instance.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Okay. So I can go here and then remove the photo issue and.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Add it back again basically.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So we just need 10 examples for the AI model to pick up the general sense with which you're doing it, right? I think it's the first tab for the AI console. Yeah.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  All right. All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. No worries. Refresh now because you've got it on four different tabs. You're going to need to refresh every single time because that's just how Gmail works. But essentially, you know, your logic here is you've got API billing and general inquiries as the three category tags that you've added to AI. Now, what you need to do is find emails that fit the category before you go to admin panel, just a second. Yeah. Can you go back to Gmail again on the same tab, please? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. Just click on the Gmail icon that should take you back to Gmail. Yeah, there we go. So go to source. Re, support, right? And what I'd say is maybe go to all views, go to closed emails because those are old emails. We've already handled them and everything, right? And over here, select emails where API, where one of the tags should be added, like pick one that you want to work with, select those emails. Oh, no. Let me give you an easier way of doing this. Can you go back?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  I can resolve it by tags. Is that what you're saying?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, basically, just like filter it by tags. Perfect. There we go.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  You can… do.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That in bulk as well? Can you go back again one more time over here? All right. Click on all conversations on the top of your screen… that one, yes, and start using the checkbox to select these emails. Now, this one's data issue that's not a tag. We're training the AI on right now. So let's yeah. So we've got billing API. If I remember correctly, let's filter from one of those two.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Okay. So billing only has maybe general query. It also has only two tags?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, that two is for open emails that's not all the emails. Okay. So if you see you have more than 50, use the checkbox, yeah, click on the tag icon, the center one on the top, this little one here. And what are we doing? We're doing it for general inquiry. So uncheck the box against general inquiry, but wait one second before you click apply. I want to make sure because once we remove it, these emails will disappear. Yeah. No, that's good. Okay. Let's do one thing. Can we, I think we'll have to go at it one email at a time? Unfortunately, yeah, let's unselect the bulk one and just pick like two or three examples for now remove the billing issue, add it back. I'm sorry, general inquiry and add it back again.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Okay. So how many tags can I train for?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You will need? Like hiver will need 10 examples for it to train the tag on.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah. And then how many tags can I train it for?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that's up to you. You can pretty much use it for all the tags you have in your account or even more than what you have right now.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Because I would need at least 10 tags.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Easy. You can have it for all the tags like as many tags as you want. You can train it on the AI. The training process is what I just told you, right? Make sure these emails are added. I mean tagged manually for the first 10 times. All right. Then go back to the hiver AI module, check the training. And if you feel that you've got the right ones, then you can have it enabled and it should start tagging it automatically.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Makes sense. Sorry.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, no worries. Go for it.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, sorry, I was facing another issue. It's like a big issue for us. So, my info and source argument is supposed to be just one inbox. Is there a possibility for both of them to be just one? Like I know I can use forwarding, but I'm not sure if it's going to be the same inbox in hiver as well?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So you want to keep the both as the same inbox. Yeah. Okay. So then what you need to do is you need to delete one of these inboxes first, go to your admin panel and add the second email address as an alias to the one that you want to consolidate it into. So if you go to your admin panel, right? Go to shared inboxes on the left side, shared inboxes… at the top. Yeah, perfect. So, yeah, now, let's say you wanted to keep info, source and support at source, right? Both are the same. I.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Want to keep the support. Yeah. And I want all the emails and those at the support.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Now, before you make any changes, note that whatever you're doing will only work for emails received from this point forward the moment you delete info, source, those emails will not be automatically added to source already, right? The emails are not deleted. They will still be in Gmail. It's just that you can't combine them and migrate them and do any of that stuff.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that's okay. All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. So if you're good to go, you can discard like click on the bin and that'll delete info at source. Yeah, just type out the text in blue.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Delete the shed. Inbox. Perfect. All right. We'll give it a minute or two for the system to load, go to source. Re, support. The first one that you want to keep like open it. Yeah, perfect. You're going to see aliases in the center of your screen like left corner under autoresponder. Yes, there you go. You already got there. We go. That's this that's the process.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And that should do it. All right. So going forward, any email that's sent to source. I mean, info at source, red B. Com would effectively show up in support at source red B. Com. So source re, support is now common for support contact and info at that, you'd like you wanted, right?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  It was pretty easy. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's pretty straightforward. So with that said, for the AI tagging, like I said, you know, you've got to make sure that you give it 10 examples where you manually add the tag, you can train it on all the tags and as many tags as you want. There's no limit on how many tags you can train it on, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And what will happen is that the system will keep getting better over time and over usage, right? We've got about a 90 percent accuracy as we've heard from most of our customers that have the paid AI and they're using it for like a long time. So, what I'm basically saying is don't expect 100 percent accuracy right out of the gate. Just like any AI system, it's going to take a couple of days, right? So, yeah. So that's the perspective on AI tagging and that's how you can go about it. Now, if you go to hiver, AI, let's just make sure that one email that we did for general inquiry got picked up, configure against AI tagging. Okay, general inquiry. There you go. So if you click on that, that's your one email that we just added. Now, you have two ways of doing this. You can either click on, pull more emails and that will show you examples and you can remove it from here or you can go back to your inbox like we did one email at a time and add 10 emails that should be in this category. Yeah. Once it's ready, if you click on manage tags at the top of your screen a little above. Yeah, that one. So once it's ready, those tags will show up here. So once general inquiry has 10 examples and it feels like it's ready to go, that will show up here. There'll be a slider for you to enable or disable it. There will be a prompt as well that's auto generated by the system that will tell you these are the situations where general inquiry tag will be auto applied by the hiver AI, right? If you want to tweak it further, you feel free to do the prompt and like rework it and reword it depending on your preference or go back to the training module, change the example emails and you should be good to go. Wow. Yeah. So that's the tagging piece. And what about this? Right? So the thank you detector basically looks for thank you sentiment and not exactly the thank you verbiage. So do you have any examples where you can show me where, you know, it didn't close it like it should have.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  It's like every day, hundreds of videos, every drop. Yeah, thanks for confirming. Yeah, I understand. It's always something else with.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thank you. Oh, no. Can you just like open it because it technically should have closed this? I do realize that my AI team is kind of reworking the thing. I just want to make sure that we have.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  I have noticed even if it's just thank you like nothing else. Like I think more with billing… excuse me with invoices or.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  To be a day or night… I'm not going to find it today.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. I mean, like.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  But there's nothing I can do about it, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No. What I'm trying to understand, is the issue that it's closing them or that it's not closing them?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  That it's not closing them because I get like hundreds of thank yous every day on emails and like it doesn't have anything substantial like it's mostly like, thank you. Have a good day or thank you. Thanks for helping or something like that. And it just reopens it. So, I was wondering if there's something I can add to it like if it says thank you right now or if it says, thanks for your support.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I mean, your thought process is right? It's just that if it isn't working properly, then we'll have to debug it on with like one or two examples to be used as a, you know, as a debugging mechanism. Yeah, because the general expectation that you have is, hey, if it says, thank you. Blah, blah blah, it should automatically close it to work as well. Yeah. Right. So, if it doesn't do what it's supposed to do, I think my support team will be the better people to sort of give you exact guidance, take some examples and do some digging there. Yeah.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Okay, perfect. And.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  then the Asana you said, can you click on apps?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, I can click on apps.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. You should have Asana, can you click on the Asana like name there? Yeah. All right. Can you click on share? All right. Can you click on the eye… at the very corner? Yeah, field visibility at the top, you scroll down and see if you have the relevant fields you need listed out here.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  No, I don't I can't scroll and my Asana description is very specific.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So, with Asana, what was your requirement? If you don't mind me asking?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah. So I'll show it to you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. Yeah.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  It needs a submitter name, title of the request, which type of task, if it's support, QA improvement plan unplanned and then which client is it that the support is coming from? And then this and then word carrier because it has different… options on the folder. So it's admin folder like where is the issue coming from? Got it, got it and then flow. And I want it to be more detailed but got.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah. And it doesn't have option to attach.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Files files. Got it. So on the Asana integration front, right? With hiver, that is more of a work in progress in terms of it's a recent feature we've launched and it's not fully built out in the sense of having deep like deep integration capabilities. So, at this stage, Asana integration would be a feature request from what I'm seeing on your screen and what you're looking for, right? So what I'd suggest is again having that filed as a feature request with my team will be the best way to go about it so that they can track it, see what's happening and see if it aligns with our roadmap and they can keep you posted right now here's. Where you can do that. From there we go. Yeah. So I'm just going to give you the link to the webpage where you can log in using your hiver email address and have a feature request raised that will put it up with my product team's radar. And the only reason I'm asking you to do it is because it's probably better when it comes from you in terms of the details in terms of the depth of the detail and all of that stuff.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So let me just, there you go. So that's the link. I've just put it on zoom chat.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. Yeah.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah. I'm just trying to see if I'm just using it to its full potential. So I was wondering if I should have automated replies to everybody who sends it in an email because what happens is it takes a little time for us to get back because these are usually technical issues. So how do I, how do I automate like a generic issue? Like, you know, like these people, it just sends me like a ticket. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, no, makes sense. That's pretty straightforward. Go to your hiver admin panel again, please?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. And then shared inboxes, always shared inboxes first. And then open the inbox where you want to set up something like this, go to auto responder in the center under automations below that. Sorry, auto responder. Yeah. So this is your generic one. So what you need to do first is enable it on the right side using the slider top, right? Okay. Yeah. And then you can type out a message and you can be like, hey, you either have this going out standard like you showed with zillow, right? Standard for all the people you receive. If you want to exclude anybody like an auto mailer or things like that, then you can.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  So, I can add like VIP domains because I have all the domains who are important and I need to reach out to them personally so I can exclude them. And for the rest of everybody.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You'll have to list out the domains as well. Like you'll have to copy paste the domains. Hiver has no way of knowing what the VIP domains are, right?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Oh, wow. It gave me an option. Oh.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's your porn fill that's not hiver, that's just Google Chrome.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Oh, okay. Sorry.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. So, just copy paste the domains there. And once you do that, they will be excluded from the autoresponder for everybody else. Whatever you type out here will be that standard message that goes out here. We've got your email. We'll get back to you within 24 48 hours, however you'd like to phrase it. And that way every incoming email gets this as the first reply. And then you can get back to it when you get time.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Okay. Yeah, makes sense for sure. And… also every time I create a ticket, I have to manually put the, put this SRC number from Asana like this is the serial number of Asana task. Okay? So I have to manually add it here. Is there a way, I… can understand if I'm not generating my ticket from here on Asana, then it's impossible for hiver to know. So, unless we figure that out, this is not going to happen?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, I mean, unless I don't think we have the capability for you to be able to create one from here. Unless I'm mistaken, can you open a ticket that has an Asana card… or something like that?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, I can just, I guess add it. Oh, sorry. You want to see the one which already has a card?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, like something that has Asana like data from Asana showing in as part of the conversation.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  All of these are supposed to have.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  There we go. All right. Can you click on the plus icon on the top right? So this was the ticket creation one where you wanted additional fields. All right. And the,

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  best part about this is that when I created a ticket from here, when the task is created, it also sends the link to the hiver conversation. So I can just if I'm on the task, I can just click on the conversation and it takes me back.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So over here, you want custom fields based on your ticket creation form that you have, and that will make the ticket creation better for you. And that is the other one.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah. And when the card is showing up here, I would also like to see the SRC… the serial number basically. Can you click on?

  Show more. No, that makes sense. You go back to one of the cards and just click on, show more. It's going to be in the bottom right of the card. Okay, scroll down a bit more, please, like I want to just see it in like two or three cards, see if it's listed anywhere else. Okay? It looks like we don't fetch that data for you or that field and is SRC number a custom field in Asana or is it more like a default field?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  I think it's a default field. I've never seen a task without one. So I'm pretty sure it's a default one. But either way, it's like, so I think, yeah, it's better to have it both ways. I would want the SRC to be here and I would want the hiver conversation link on the Asana task that it does. If I create it from here, I will have the link but it's not, it doesn't work the other way around.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So, yeah, Naima, at this stage, this would be a feature request because like I said, yeah.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, no, no, I understand. I just wanted to ask you. So how do you think we're using it? Is it the way it's meant to be used? Or am I missing like something?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, I mean, Naima, I'll be fully transparent with you with what I've seen. It does seem like you've got the basics of hiver usage sorted out. You've got tags, you've got slas, you've got, you know, categories running sentiments are active? Do you have templates and stuff like that as well? Is that something you'd use?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, I have templates, but like I haven't put up a sheet and I haven't uploaded the documents yet.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So then that could be another suggestion where copilot could have those, you know, knowledge sources and that could make it draft better replies for you. And we also have email templates as a separate feature as well.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Right. Go.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Back to Gmail, please Gmail icon on the top left or that, yes, scroll down and you see email templates on the left side. There you go. So go over here, click on create email template, copy paste, and this is your typical regular email template.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Okay. And, sorry, how does it work? When I, when I'm using my, oh.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, sure. Just like composing your email or reply to something?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, sure. Yeah, just click on that and share it with all for now. Yeah. Save it, please bottom, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. Now, it works on both replies and on new email composers. The moment you open the reply box, you're going to see an option at the bottom that's going to look like an envelope… the third one on the bottom. Yeah, that one that's your email templates, all your saved templates will show up here. Click on that. It's going to give you a preview and then you can insert that template, there you go.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So you can start building it out from there. You can have attachments included on the templates as well. So, while you're creating the email templates, if there's attachments, things like that you'll want to use, you can have that connected here as well.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Oh, sorry. What did you say?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It can have attachments as well, pre included.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Oh, oh, that's great. Okay. Like things temperatures or invoices, everything.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It supports hyperlinks, it supports images, logos. It can have attachments of files as well. These are two separate things. I want to make sure that you have that distinction. Email templates are more for replies. This one is for training the co pilot, so that when you wanted to draft a reply for you, it goes through these documents, you're uploading and then gives you a reply.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, makes sense. And then how do I use the co pilot if it's free?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, on the, once it's trained, like in this case, training is basically having the right knowledge sources attached. Click on the right side where I'm highlighting. Yeah.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah. This, oh.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, the spark like on… this one, yeah, perfect. So there you go. So once you have the documents and everything uploaded here, oh, whoops. Can you scroll up?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah. Sorry. How do I disable? This?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Can you refresh?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We'll give a minute. Yeah, there we go. Click on the hiver logo. I'm sorry, the co pilot logo. Yeah, there we go. So once you have the documents uploaded and, you know, you have the right information given to hiver. When you click on draft a reply, click on draft a reply. The first one, I will give you three scenarios, you can choose a scenario and then it will look at the email content stuff inside. And then based on the documents you've uploaded, which is, hey, this is what we do as process. This is what we need to ask. Once that's there, the co pilot would be able to give you proper response that you can just insert and send out for now. If you want to test it, just pick a number and just put it down below like just type one or two. Yeah.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  No, no, I've got. Yeah. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's basically the scenario right now, it doesn't have documents as such. So, I'm just going to think it's giving you a generic response, is what I'm assuming once it has the documents and everything, it's going to fill that in with more details that are specifically needed by your business that you need to collect.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah. Sorry. I'm asking, I think I've asked this before, but when is the trial going to expire? And if the trial expires then am I going to lose everything that I have trained the AI for? Yes, you would, I would lose and how long is the trial for?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that's if you click on your hiver logo, you should see that as part of the banner message, click on your hiver logo, admin panel. No worries. There you go. So you have your AI trial ends in seven days? I'm sorry, nine days. Okay. So.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  And you're saying it's 20 dollars for the, yeah. And I think they're already paid like 30 dollars per seat for the program?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Quickly double check… let's see, got modern tech. I'm sorry, just a sec. Yeah, you're at 59 dollar per user per month on the pro plan and on the monthly version, I mean, you do have the annual version that you can choose and that's at 45 usd per person per month. And the AI add on is typically a 20 dollar per user per month. Additional, I do have leverage for a small discount if that helps, you know, make this easier. Yeah.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah, definitely. Yeah, because I have to convince my team to get it and I am the only one using it primarily. So I'm not sure if they would care a lot about it, but I'm convincing them to like we have separate products, separate companies. So I'm encouraging everybody to move this here and train the support so that we get rid of the manual process all for once.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely Naima. Well, hey, on the commercial front, I'm happy to support you if like a small discount would help you make it easier to transition and have the AI included as well. Considering your trial ends in nine days. Let me do one thing. Let me just make a note for myself nine days basically means you've got like what? Seven eight nine. So your trial expires on the sixteenth. How about I touch base with you on the thirteenth of November? Yeah. I'll just send you a follow up email. You let me know, you know, if by then you've trained the AI, if it makes sense. And you know, if you want to, if you feel like a small discount would help, I can work with my team, send over a pricing proposal. If it makes sense, we can just have that moved for you on the paid AI version?

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Yeah. So you are saying I would save 10 dollars if I move to the early plan, I would go from 59 to 60 49.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Let me do one thing. Naima. Let me, I know there's a lot of numbers I've thrown your way. So, let me just consolidate all this in an email and I'll have it sent out before I end my shift today.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That way you can use that as reference reply on the same email that on, you know, before the trial ends and whether you want to go ahead or not based on which, you know, we can look at what's the best discounting possible on that front. Yeah. All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. Anything else? I know we just got a minute. I do have to hope for a next meeting. All right. So, at this point, Naima, I think you've got as much information as you would need. Yeah. So let me do one thing, right? Let me send you an email with the details. Write back to me on the same email with any additional questions, things like that, and I can look in the right person if it's support or tech team that needs your attention. I put you in touch with them and we'll keep chatting, right? We can definitely hope on another meeting sometime next week if you want. Yeah. I think I would email… for sure. All right, then. Naima. Well, hey, pleasure chatting with you. Look for my email and we'll continue discussion. Yeah, have a great day.

Naima Fakhri (naima.fakhri@gmail.com):
  Have a great day, see.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Ya, bye.
