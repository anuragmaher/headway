Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on, Nick?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, Nick. Hey, grant.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, can you guys hear me?

Nick Valentine (nick@vitaneedle.com):
  Yeah. Can you hear me now? Oh.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Perfect. There we go. How's it going? Nick? Good. How's it going? Good. Hey, grant… but no, I appreciate both y'all hopping on. Will Fred be hopping on today?

Nick Valentine (nick@vitaneedle.com):
  I don't think he will be.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. No, no worries. Just wanted to just make sure before we get started, but yeah, we saw that Frederick signed off on the contract. So we're all good to go from a, you know, kicking off the implementation and introduction to the customer success manager standpoint. So, our next steps from here team is I'm going to introduce you to a customer success manager over email. They'll be providing the implementation and team training going forward. And then in tandem, we'll also be introducing you to our technical support team who will begin assisting you with the migration of the historical emails. And as we agreed upon, that will be completely covered in a zero charge fee. Are there any questions that you have for me?

Nick Valentine (nick@vitaneedle.com):
  I didn't have any specific questions. Grant. I don't know if you did.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  I'm trying to remember, did you cover the, we… were talking about this morning? Sorry, Nick. I'm trying to remember again. Well, I think it was just the tagging which we already covered. I think the only other question Cole, is we're going to look to migrate all of our data over and I wanted to have a timeline sort of spelled out ahead of time. Is that something that we can still do?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So our support team, I'm not sure if you saw, but they sent over an email maybe to Frederick and Nick. Maybe you weren't on it grant for some reason, but they said it would take about like 15 days to migrate the data based on the volume that you gave us. And then we also provide a quote for it, but we're going to not charge you for it as a part of the partnership. It's going to be a zero sum, okay?

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  Alright, that's good to hear. 15 days is more than adequate. I was thinking it might be over the course of like a month or two. So that's fine. And then just one clarification part of the language in the contract notes that in the event of us, you know, deciding to no longer work together, we have, I think 14 days to get our data out. Just, could you break down what that data is?

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  I assume it may be analytical or configuration data that we've you know, built up over the time using the platform. It's not like it's our emails or anything. I don't think that's on your servers. Is that right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's correct? That's exactly all the emails are your emails. It's all in the Gmail servers. Yeah. And then the data we're talking about is like, you know, the tags we create on our side, maybe custom fields, and some of those analytics that you might want to export to like another system, a data lake, whatever it might be.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  Right. Okay. That's perfect. And then I think we only have one other question which I'm going to jump into your system here.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  Bear with me for a second. Sorry all.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  So, you guys have a section for your developer apis. Is there some documentation somewhere in terms of where those endpoints are? And do you guys have a resource on the team that I could work with down the road for utilizing those apis?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you can work with a combination of our technical support team and our success manager can also assist with, you know, scheduling those calls where you'll have access to our technical support team throughout the relationship and they'll help, you know, configure rules, automations and stuff like that.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  Okay. Well, that's moving forward then what's the next timeline in terms of, you know, getting the implementation fully rolled out? Yeah. So what I'm.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  going to do after this is I'm going to introduce you to a customer success manager over email. They'll then schedule a call with you to, you know, kick off the relationship, schedule a scoping call and begin the implementation team training. And then in that, I'm also going to introduce you to our technical support team who's going to assist with the migration of those emails in the hybrid.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  Okay, perfect. I think. Sorry, I'm remembering my one question now we have, is there a configuration? This might be a better question for the support team? But I'll ask you now anyways, when we're working within the shared inbox, the hiver, shared inbox and our personals, and we want to respond to an email that really should be response from… the sales email domain. Is there a configuration setting that allows us to default? So right now, the reason I ask is right now it will default to a reply from, you know, let's say I'm using my personal account. It'll default to reply for my personal, and I don't want to be using my personal in a lot of cases and we don't want personal emails used in a lot of cases. We want everything to stay within the sales inbox for a couple of different reasons. Is there a way to configure it? So then when you are working in that sales, shared sales inbox and you go to a hit reply, it automatically prompts to the sales email from address being used instead of the personal. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's exactly correct. So we can either default it. So it's the shared inbox or it's the personal, so you can do it either way. So 100 percent, that is a possibility.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  Okay. Sorry, if you already covered that, I just popped back into my mind, no.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All good. And this is something our success manager will help throughout the implementation, making sure that everyone's good to go on the knowledge and trained up on the.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  Platform. Yeah, I don't know that I had any other questions, Nick. I'm trying to remember all the things we covered this morning.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  I don't know that one.

Nick Valentine (nick@vitaneedle.com):
  Was the only one I forgot about this morning.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Perfect. Yeah. Okay. I think we have a good game plan going forward. So I will be on the lookout within the next hour. I'll be sending out those emails and introductions and then, yeah, we'll just get all this underway, but I appreciate all your time throughout the evaluation and looking forward to getting y'all up and running. Yeah.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  Thanks for the extension. It was helpful to have a few extra days to poke at this and the ability to get all of our data over that's really helpful. So, thanks for looking forward to those shared contacts and we'll set our time up to get this off and running. All right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Awesome. I appreciate it, guys. Hope you have a happy year and we'll be in touch.

Grant Mathews (grant@vitaneedle.com):
  Thank you. You too. Take care. Bye bye.
