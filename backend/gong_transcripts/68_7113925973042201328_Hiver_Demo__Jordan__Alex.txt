Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  my outlook one's not as my recorder showed up. So we have two products.

Jordan Hamm (jordanh@fullcoveragesolutions.com):
  That's why? Okay? Because when I was trying to, okay… is that it was weird because when I put in like the shared inbox address like it wouldn't let me continue. So, I don't know.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Did you start with the shared inbox? Were you trying to like self sign up? Yeah, yeah. There's a blocker. It has a pretty static flow, but essentially how this works within the shared inbox of hiver, like… I'm actually not sure if we're going to be a great fit based on being able to send from multiple different domains and my Gmail product. I support that. So I could have like all of your sorry, I'm in the settings tab. I could have all of your clients here based on who's writing in or working off like Google's protocols. So you would select reply from the same address that it was sent to.

Jordan Hamm (jordanh@fullcoveragesolutions.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  In terms of these protocols, like, yes, we could reply from the same address, but you wouldn't be able to have like a rich footer because that's more of like a domain level.

Jordan Hamm (jordanh@fullcoveragesolutions.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Well, I appreciate that. I don't like, do you know of any other? Like I also like Freshdesk, I reached out to and I had one call and then they never sent pricing like never heard back from them, which I thought was insane. And then I did a demo with sendbird. I'm just curious like from your perspective, like… they're just so like they're so expensive for these ticketing systems. I'm curious like from your perspective, what sounds like it might be a good fit for what I'm looking for is like Zendesk probably as good as it gets.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I don't think Zendesk is quite right either because they're going to get like a Zendesk ticket. Your clients are going to get a Zendesk ticket reply and that's going to be like a little off.
