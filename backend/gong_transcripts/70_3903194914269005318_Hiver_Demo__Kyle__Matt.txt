Call: Hiver Demo | Kyle <> Matt
Date: 2026-01-28T02:00:54+05:30
================================================================================

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  hey, Matthew. Hey.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Kyle, how you doing?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  How's it going? All right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good, good, matt or Matthew is totally fine. Great. Sounds good. All right. I'm letting Fabio in here.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Invited a couple people from the finance team… what's up Fabio?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  But we have here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Too. Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hello. I gotcha.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  I believe one more person. Eric also on the finance side said yes to this, Katja, Fabio. Do you think we should wait for him or get started?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We can go ahead. OK, yeah.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Matt, I'll let you kick it off. I don't know how you usually do these things.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  And then I can probably give a high level of what we're working for and why we're talking to hiver today.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, the agenda is like to spend the first five minutes or so learning about what you're looking for, you know, reason for booking the call today, requirements, things like that. And then from there, I can tell you about hiver and walk through the products. So, yeah, I'll hand it over to you, Kyle. Cool.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  So, high level finance team members can get into the details of their workflow. If we need to. The finance team has tons of emails come in from, you know, external vendors and things like that. Invoices, all the typical finance things. They used to use Jira for these things. You know, those emails would come in. They would automatically create tickets and they were able to work out of, you know, sort of a tipping system to manage all those things collaboratively. Unfortunately, that stopped the security setting that allowed for external, you know, people to send us emails like that. Our security team was like, yo, that's not great. Actually, it gives them access to all this other stuff we need to shut this down. And so the finance team, in addition, the logistics team who weren't able to make it here today, like who are working very similar workflows, like sort of lost their, this ability to use Jira. And now the finance team especially has been struggling to, you know, work out of Gmail inboxes, definitely, you know, it's definitely a downgrade from what they were doing before. So, we're talking to a couple of different services that we hope will sort of, you know, either be a dedicated or a Gmail first like workflow replacement for the ticketing they were doing in Jira before and just be easier to work with than, you know, email inboxes and Gmail all day long.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yep. That's exactly what hiver does. It's directly out of Gmail. It's easy to use. So, and we have, you know, thousands of finance teams using hiver for this exact same thing, managing communication with vendors accounts, receivable, anything like that. So, yeah, this is exactly what hiver does. How many people is this between the finance and logistics team?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Well, logistics site I think is less than 10… Fabio. Can you say how many people on the finance side would be using this?

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Yeah, at least four for the ap side, and then maybe a couple licenses for visibility to other people. So, less than 10, like you said, yeah.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  I'd say, you know, to put a number on it. I'd say like let's say 20 licenses total.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That's finance and that's finance and logistics total, right? Okay. Great. Because, yeah, interesting enough. The reason, yeah, I spoke to someone from the logistics. I had this, I had a demo yesterday with someone from the logistics, Maxine, ouyang. Oh.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Yeah. One of the people I'm talking to actually kind of funny because I pinged them this morning and said, hey, I'm actually talking to a couple different people this week. Do you folks want to be added to these demos? And I haven't heard anything back from that team yet? Oh, no, actually, they did. One of the people from logistics said we were actually wondering how finance and accounting deal with large volume emails. Maxine had a demo for hiver. I'd be interested to see if it kind of depends on the timing today or tomorrow. So I didn't see if kindert can make it right now, but, you know, I don't think we have to hold up for them or anything like that. Okay, great. Yeah. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I figured when I saw it that you guys were probably evaluating together and it looks like you guys, you know, booked these meetings. I mean she had hers first but you booked them around the same time. So. But yeah, I mean based on the call that I had yesterday with Maxine, you know, she definitely felt that hiver was a good fit. So, yeah, things were looking good there as well. She thought that it would be quite good for her team. And then, yeah, can you see my screen here? Yes. Awesome. So just want to walk through a couple of slides, give you a little background about hiver but essentially, you know, one of the main reasons that people choose hiver is that it's easy to use fairly fast to get up and running here. We have AI capabilities which are easy to get implemented and rolled out… and a little bit about our company as well. We're a modern, you know, AI company, Gmail, first company, certified Google partner. We've been around since 2017. We've raised over 30,000,000 dollars in funding. We have over 200 employees across the globe.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Over 10,000 companies across 50 countries are using us ranging from different sectors, logistics, technology, financial services, from small businesses, all the way up to companies like capital one, flexport, and samsara, just to name a few. So while it is quite easy to use it's, also quite powerful, quite scalable as well. We have all the necessary security things in line as well. I sent Maxine our security information, happy to send all that to you as well. And let me go ahead and share my screen here. And if you don't mind sharing, what are the other solutions that you're looking at?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Yeah, you're the first person we've talked to. We're also in keeping and front, we've got some familiarity with on this it team. But yeah, I don't think we have to go into pros and cons between them. I just said you're the first people we've talked to, but just so you know.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. Yep. So, yeah, what you'll notice differences then is we're actually directly out of your Gmail. We're a certified Google partner. You simply download the hiver extension. Once you download the extension, you're going to see these yellow icons in the top right here and these yellow icons down here in the left. So it's going to be conveniently in your Gmail. You're not going to have to leave your Gmail. You can answer your personal emails just like normal. Except now you're going to see those shared emails on the left hand side. So, yeah, you decide who has access to these folders. Is the team using shared emails right now for the?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Vendors, well, just this team, I know has tried Gmail's collaborative inbox feature and they said it was not, I suppose feature complete, didn't do everything they wanted to do. I'm not sure what the finance team is doing right now.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  We're just, yeah, there's just an alias that we're all a part of. So we're just responding to them as they come in. And the way that we know if people have been touching them is they replied back to the same alias. So we can see that back and forth thread.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And what's the alias? Just just.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  It's just a, it's a doodle group.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's a Google group. Okay. Perfect. It's a group. Yeah, perfect. So yeah, you can keep. So, yeah, that's exactly what I was telling Maxine yesterday. You can use Google groups or create new shared email address. Doesn't matter. And basically, you're just going to connect that Google group to a folder here in hiver. And it's going to give you a lot more capabilities, a lot more visibility, a lot more functionality. Okay. Right. So basically, now, everyone on the finance team who has access to this folder, every time somebody emails that group, it's going to land in this folder for everybody to see. And where they start, is they're going to start in the unassigned folder? So when the emails come in, they start in the unassigned folder.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And now when you open these emails, you're going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can assign it to each other. So instead of you know, seeing who's replied or et cetera. You're going to decide who's working on it. If I assign this to, matt gets notified and it's going to be in my mind folder. So everybody on the team has their own mind folder where they're going to see the emails that are on their plate. There's also tags so that you can categorize these emails. And we also have a ton of automations where this can actually get automated. So, for instance, if Fabio handles all the invoice questions based emails, basically, we can do an automation that says any email that comes in that has the word invoice in the subject or body of the email, we want it to automatically be assigned to Fabio and we want it to automatically have the invoice tag.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Out of curiosity. So this is like my third hybrid demo. And the one thing that stuck out to me that you mentioned is the new AI feature, what is your AI doing? Or what can it do that it hasn't been able to do before? In terms of kind of like scanning the email and setting? You know what I mean? Like can it rationalize… if we don't have, if an email comes in and there's no set rule for it, like what is your AI doing?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's a good question. There's a couple of things it could do, but I think one of the main ones here that's newer since you have seen hiver before, is the AI tagging where essentially how this works is you are going to describe to the AI, you know, which type of emails get, which types of tags, and then the AI is going to just start automatically applying those tags. So it's not just using keywords, it's essentially going to be able to read the email and then place the tags accordingly.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  So we can train it to basically say, you know, service interruption or something like that. You know, we get a lot of emails that we may have something where it's kind of like, you know, we're late. We're behind on it and I'm wondering, does your AI, can it prioritize and basically say, hey, you guys need to look at this one? Does that make sense?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think so.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Yeah, I think, you know, can it determine urgency… and priority is what Fabio is asking? Can it bubble up urgent things? It's like, hey, of all the last 10 emails, right? This one needs to be responded to ASAP.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So urgency and priority and I guess how, what's the best way for it to know if something is urgent or priority? Again? I.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  mean, we're kind of asking you, right? Like that's a pretty common feature for AI tools and whatnot right? So it sounds like the answer to the question is like, can the AI figure that out itself through the context of emails? Sounds like no, but we would have to train it on like keywords or something like that like, hey, if you see the word urgent or past due or something, we would have to plug that in order to teach it that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So we got two things, right? We have automations with keywords. So if there are keywords that, you know, let you know that something's urgent or priority, then we can set up an automation for that which would absolutely work. And then the other one is with the AI here as well. So I'll ask my team as well. But basically, this is kind of what like an AI example is. So this is for a feature request tag and it's saying that a tag is used for emails where a customer suggests new functionality or enhancements to existing features. This tag should be applied to email content, focused on improvements additions, feature questions, right? So it, basically, once you describe it like that, then this tag will get applied. Okay?

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Yeah, that's kind of what I was going with it because we deal with a lot of small businesses too. And, you know, if we're getting a service interruption, but like a bigger company, it's going to be more of a standard wording. But if we have like a smaller, you know, like let's say Kyle is one of our contractors that we haven't paid in the last three months. He's not going to send us a standard worded template. He's going to be like, hey, guys, I've been emailing and nobody's been responding or, hey, I haven't been paid in a while, so that's the kind of AI that I was wondering. Does hiver do where he can read the email and basically say, hey, this Guy Kyle here, you know, is reaching out and he's not happy. Can we bubble this up?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So I think the AI tagging might work for that scenario. But another thing is we have AI sentiment analysis. So you can actually see this sentiment right here. So, yes, we are, the AI is automatically tracking the sentiment of the emails. And if you got an email, let me go into a different inbox here that… somebody's unhappy or negative, then, yes, then we can set up automations, where it gets, you know, prioritized flagged assigned a certain person, all the above. But yes, our AI is tracking the sentiment of all the emails coming in.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Okay, perfect. Yeah, that's what I meant earlier by, like, can it rationalize? And okay, this is good. Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, there's that. And then, yeah, you'll see here here's, all the sentiments coming in.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Tags and there's custom fields here where you can put text fields in drop down fields in as well. Invoice numbers. We also have something called AI extract which can actually extract like invoice numbers, any numerical numbers from the email and automatically have it fill the custom fields as well.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  I'm curious on the automation side, can you have something set up where like the first person on the finance team to respond to an email, it auto assigns to them? Is that possible?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  The first person who responds to an email will be assigned it? Yes, you can.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Cool.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Is this scanning a document when you're talking about filling in certain fields? Like an attachment? I mean.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, not at this time.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Oh, so it's just scanning the email itself.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's scanning the text and subject of the email yep.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  I got it. Yeah, it's we.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  wouldn't.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  use this feature. But yeah, this feature sounds incomplete if it's not scanning the document because we do get emails in our, you know, sent to us directly. We have a whole separate email for invoice submissions, but we do get some people that confuse our inquiries with an invoice submission and, you know, they don't give details in the body of the email. They'll just say here's, my latest invoice. And then the document itself will have all the info.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me, let me ask my team if that's going to be on the roadmap here soon, okay?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  So, just to clarify, it sounds like hiver can't do anything with email attachments right now, right? Like, any attached PDFS or anything. Hiver just can't touch them. Yep. Pretty much that's fine. Just wanted to confirm.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Let's see here. We can set up approval flows, right? If you needed this to go ahead and get approved by other people on your team, they can go ahead and get notifications up there. Here's, the notes section where you can put notes, you can attach documents down here. You hit the add mention button. Everyone's name in the account pops up and it's like, hey, Cole, can you help with this? And then Cole here would get notified that we've asked him to help on this email. You can reply to the emails directly here within hiver. Everybody in the folder can see the replies. You can set up email templates that can be shared with the team. We have AI chat gpt in here where you can, you know, fix the grammar, make it more empathetic, et cetera. And then we also have an AI co pilot… which can draft replies for you. It learns from the past emails that you've gotten it's. Going to ask a for prompt question for accuracy purposes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, it'll go ahead and draft up a reply for you. You can make changes to it where it's pulling from it's. Pulling from a different thing. It can pull from documents that you have. If you have documents, the interoperating procedures that you can attach to it in the backend, it can pull from snippets, and it can also pull from a hiver knowledge base.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  For the documents, it can connect to what does it integrate with Google drive confluence?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, confluence and Google drive are on the roadmap right now. It's just you just strictly upload those documents. Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Fabio, did you have a question?

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Oh, no, I thought, I did. I guess not.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then we also have notion as well.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Yeah. We're not using notion. Right now. We are primarily working out of Google drive and trying to give some tlc to confluence so those are heavy hitters on the knowledge base side.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  OK.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  I'm curious, do you have any sort of like metrics, dashboard or anything like that? Shows like all open to dits, or I'm sorry, all open emails or emails that haven't been closed out in the last three days or, you know, like how many each person's closed? Anything like that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. We have all of that. So let me show you this one view real quick. And then I'll get into the reporting which covers all that. This kind of covers it as well. But in each of these groups that you have set up, there's going to be a team folder. And this shows what we just talked about. This shows all the open emails across this group. We know which ones are late, who's working on what? And the sentiment analysis, everything… right? So I can see here, we have a lot in this folder. I can see that this one's late. So you can set up custom slas for certain types of emails based on the tag or you can have it for all the emails. So it could be like, you know, when you get a, when you get an email about a late payment, we want to make sure that the email gets responded to within three hours. And if it's not responded to within three hours, we want the following people to get notified. And yeah, so you can set up custom slas across the board. You can click on anyone's name too. So if Cole's out today, I can click on his name, I can see all the emails he's working on. I can see all the back and forwards he's had with that person.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Stuff… right? So I can click on anyone's name, and I can see all the back and forwards with this customer or email. I can see all the history when it came in, the tags that got applied changes, notes, et cetera. I can reply for him. I can close it out. I can even take someone's if Alex is out today, I can take all of his work here and just assign it to somebody else. And then basically how this works is you'll see it's 46 and there's five with Alex here. Once I go ahead and close one out. Now, it's going to be four and then 45.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But yeah, and this team view lets you see all the open ones, all the late ones sentiment analysis. And we can also create different automations for these emails when they're late as well?

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Out of curiosity when we reply back, is our email going to be attached to that? Or is it gonna be whatever alias or group we're using that is receiving it? So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You could set up for either?

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Okay. Because I think we'd like to, yeah. So we already have the capability to send it on behalf of, you know, our alias, but it'd be great if it was defaulted to when using the emails that hiver's picking up. Can we do that? Like, you know, if I reply for like something directly to me, it comes from me. But if I use one, if I reply to an email that comes in through hiver, it will automatically default to the alias email. Is that possible? Or do I always have to switch?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  If you want to make it so that when you're replying, so let me get this straight. When you're replying from within hiver, you want the default to be the Google group?

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Exactly I.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  believe. So, I believe that can be set. Let me just, I'll just double check with my team.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Almost almost 100 percent, I think you can. But yeah, let me just write this down.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yep. I'll ask them that also, you have the ability to create custom views, right? So it doesn't just have to be there's, the team view which you see everything. But if you wanted to have a view, you know, that had certain, you know, certain tags, certain priorities, certain custom fields, anything like that, you can create custom views as well. Okay. That's great. And then, yeah, let's talk about the analytics here.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Really good question on those views. Can we toggle it between what everybody can see versus what I just want to see? Maybe I just want to group something together just for my own fyi or is one of those things where it's like if I create it, it's visible to everybody.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  If you create, it is visible to everybody. Okay? Now, but with that being said, so… you can star certain views, right? So you may create a view, but maybe, you know, you have it starred so that it's right here in your sidebar, right? Versus if that view is not that, you know, no one else is using that view, it'll just be kind of down here as well. Okay. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So this is the analytics you select the mailbox that you want to see. You select the timeframe could be custom, could be 30 days et cetera. You're going to see the amount of active conversations you have for that timeframe, new conversations, resolve conversations. Is it higher or lower than the previous month? You can analyze this data. You can slice and dice it however you want. You can group it by, you know, person, company tax custom fields, right? You could filter this information by any anything else that you're looking for. And you can also save these different views. And then also the emails are referenced down here as well. You're also going to see the mailbox as a whole. The average performance of that mailbox, you know, first response time, first assigned, time resolution time again can all be broken down by person, tax custom fields. You're also going to see the workload across the mailbox for that timeframe. So the amount of emails that were assigned to each person, email sent by each person, the performance of each person. So each person's individual average response times, resolution times. We can also include customer satisfaction surveys if wanted tags are helpful because you can look back and say, okay, you know, last month, we got 50 emails about, you know, late payments we got, you know, 10 emails about, you know, missing invoices, so you can go back and you can track those. How many you've gotten, how many were new resolved? And you can even see with those tags, you know, response times, resolution times, et cetera. It's tracking the companies that are emailing in the contacts the people with the SLA set up. It's tracking the compliance with those slas. So the violations resolutions, right? Like how many times did we violate that three hour SLA? We had? And I can see, okay, you know, matt did it four times. Alex did it two times et cetera. Cool.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  So pretty fully featured. Fabio anyone else on the finance team? Any other questions feature questions about what I can do? Otherwise I'm going to pivot in the last couple minutes here into just like initial pricing?

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Well, how can we teach the AI not to snitch on us? Is what I'm wondering? Can we do that? What do you mean? No, it's a joke. Our average response time is high. I was like, how do we hide this from management? How can we teach the AI to fudge the numbers for us and not snitch on us?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We create our own SLA in the.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  back exactly. I'll just create a note that says, hey, AI be cool.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Listen every day at this job especially at the start of the year. I mean, I get new AI questions all day. So I don't know if it's real or joking.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  So, I mean, could it imprint on its owner, the first one to interact with it? Don't betray me?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  That's going to be me. Sorry to break it to you. I'm going to set it up.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I was like I got the rules behind the team, don't you?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Worry. Sorry, bud.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  All right. No concerns. No questions from our side. Cool. Thanks guys.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  All right. Matt, initial pricing. I don't need any promises or anything. Like I said, we're talking to two other people, right? I just need baseline. I need to figure out, you know, like I want high lows and whatnot here. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So all of our pricing's online. I'll email it to you. You'll need at least the pro plan for 20 people. Growth is capped at 10. But there's you know, based on many reasons why you would want pro, the differences between pro and elite, is, you know… one of the big things is Okta, single sign on. If that's a requirement for you guys, then you're looking at elite then, and the elite includes everything there's no usage limits for automations. Number of mailboxes, everything it's all included with one of five per user per month. It's sold in buckets of five and no additional cost for the, we're going to do the onboarding, training, dedicated account manager, 24 seven?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  About the Okta sign in? We use Okta to sign into Gmail right now? Because hiver integrates with Gmail. Would we be able to use the pro plan if we like? Would that even be technically possible, right? If we are already forced to use Okta to sign into Gmail. Are we forced into getting the elite because we need that Okta integration for hiver as well?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Let me, let me ask my team. I'm not sure on that… but yeah, and then basically, if not that, I don't think anything here. I mean, I'm not sure we'll have to figure it out. But basically, these are a list of the features that are differences and let me ask you here. So one big limit to pro is the amount of mailboxes that you can have attached to it, so, or groups that you guys are using, groups that's fine. Same thing. You can have up to five Google groups.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  I think that would be.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I think you might have less than that, right? I.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Mean, I think us, I think the logistics team that I'm talking to is only working out of a single group finance. Are you folks working out of one multiple groups?

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  It's just one. Yeah.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  That's what I thought. So five five should be fine, but.

Fabio G. (fabio.gutierrez@flyzipline.com):
  Yeah. I mean finance has their own alias, but ap has their own separate one. So we're just working out of just the ap one. Cool.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then, yeah. Then honestly, we'll find out you might be pro, you might be elite, but yeah, that's kind of ballpark parking right there, pricing. Cool. I.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Think the tech question of whether or not we need elite because we use Okta, with Gmail. I'd love to know the answer to that, but otherwise this is good. I would love a link to the pricing. And then the other thing I noticed you were recording this call since the logistics team couldn't make it. I would love a link to the recording as well. I know that they'd love to see the demo.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Yep. Absolutely. So I'll email all this over to you. And then as far as next steps here, I know you're looking at some other solutions. When can I expect to hear back from you both?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Teams obviously with Maxine, you know, talking to you yesterday, my finance team has been in a bit of a bind since the Jira, security change.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  We're moving quick on this. You know, it's not going to be the end of the month. I'll tell you that, right? It's only three days left, but the other two demos are both tomorrow. So we'll probably be looking to make an initial decision and talk about real pricing and things like that within the next, you know, by the end of next week. And then it's really going to be up to the finance and logistics teams to hopefully make a decision about something that's going to work best for them. If they do align, then we're going to move pretty fast on this.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, absolutely. And I would just say again, you know, the top reasons people like hiver is ease of use, the amount of support onboarding. We have people move over from front all the time just due to lack of kind of support. All the AI stuff here is included as well. Will we be able to put like a tentative follow up call for next week? Kyle?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Let's do that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. I'm going to put my calendar here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'm going to include somebody else from my end on the call too, to make sure any outstanding product questions you're going to answer too. How about like Wednesday or Thursday of next week?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Yeah, that sounds good. I'm wide open.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Are you PST or what time zone are you in?

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Pacific? Okay. At least I am. I'm assuming the ap team is pacific too, yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We are okay. So the earlier the better for my other colleague here is working mostly east coast.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Yeah. Let me see. I'm pulling up everyone's calendar to see at the time that works for everybody. I'm not going to worry about the logistics timing right now since it sort of dealt them in a little bit late, but at least for the ap folks, we're talking to, we're pretty wide open. We're working pretty good. Like you said earlier, the better. We can do like nine to 30 pacific, Wednesday or Thursday. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We could do, let's do, yeah, let's do Wednesday, nine 30 pacific all.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Right. Let's do it if we have to push it or if I have an update for you sooner, I'll obviously let you know, of course, it also.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Happens to be my birthday that day, but no pressure. Okay, you.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Should not be working on your birthday, but… that's all right. I've got March fourth, so you're a month ahead of me?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Well, I appreciate everyone's time today. I'll try to get all your questions answered before then anything else comes up? Let me know. But thanks so much, everyone.

Kyle Currie (kyle.currie@flyzipline.com):
  Cool. Thank you. Everyone. Thank.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You. Thanks bye.
