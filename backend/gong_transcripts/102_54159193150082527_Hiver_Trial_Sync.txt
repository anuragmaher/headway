Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on Joseph?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Good. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. I appreciate you hopping on the call here today?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Yeah, no problem.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I know we wanted to touch base to see how your internal conversations have come along in regards to other potential use cases, maybe being added to the trial. I know, you know, it's running until November. So just wanted to kind of kick it on over to you to see how that went on your side and what kind.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Of makes the most sense from here. Yeah. So for right now, I was, we're trying to get our business slash HR people on.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It just to see what they thought of it.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  I talked to admin about it. They were noncommittal either way, they just kind of wanted business's opinion as well if it was something they would utilize. I kind of that's kind of where we're at. We're kind of in limbo, but I didn't get a real definitive decision from administration. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So it's basically like does admin? Like do you think HR will definitely jump in and start testing it?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  That's my hope. I talked to our HR department and there's only two people in there between business and HR together. I wanted to see if they thought it would be something that they would share together. And I talked to administration about it, just kind of show them their uses they could use on it. But again, we're such a small school, they get pretty lenient on doing a lot of things just because budget, they're, very budget conscious. So I always have trouble getting stuff I want.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For sure. Yeah, I guess when would be a good time to touch base with you? Joe. Just talk about like, you know, solidifying the partnership, you know, what, how many licenses you want to move forward and stuff like that. I know the trial is running until the.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Nineteenth, what kind of makes the most sense for you? You know, if we can get on the seventeenth that day is open for me right now. Okay. I will have a definitive answer one way or the other from admin and HR.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. So I can definitely, I can do same time as now if that works too. Yeah, that.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Works for me.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. So I just sent that over and then, yeah, let me know if there's any other questions in the meantime, Joe, but I appreciate, you know, hopping on here real quick. Yep. All right. I'll talk to you soon. Yep. Bye.
