Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Jeff, can you hear me?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Morning, I can.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hey, hi. How's it going?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Doing good. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Good. I'm good about ready for the weekend. It's been a long week. Yeah.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  I hear you. It's been a long week.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, Jeff, is it just the two of us today? Yeah?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  I think so. I don't think Jaclyn will be on and I don't think Ken will be on. I think they're in some other calls.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Perfect. And from the hiver side, Jessica's not going to be able to join us because she's on pto today. So, if you're good to go ahead, we can get started. The primary agendas that I had in mind for today. The reason why we booked us for 45 minutes as well is I want to spend a good 15, 20 minutes sort of understanding as much as I can about your workflows, right? Figuring out the different ways in which you function, what's important, which of these are things you'd like to improve using hiver on day one. And based on that, I can give you like a tailored demo in terms of, hey, this is how these specific workflows can be handled via hiver. And we can, you know, set up a time for next week to have your account added to the subscription as well. Does that make sense? It does alright. Perfect. So, Jeff, whenever you're ready, if you could share your screen and, you know, tell me a little bit more in detail about how things work within your team today.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  One second here for.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. Take your time.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Alright. So basically let me get in here. So what I generally have to do is I have two mailboxes that I basically have to monitor back and forth. So I have my regular Jeffrey Murray at air general. And then I have the ind at air general. Yeah, I'm sorry, ind at air general account that I have to monitor as well.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Feeding into this box. I have, there is a delta ind at air general, a united or it would be DL ind. So… one for each airline, basically delta, Alaska, united and American, those all filter into this box here along with any of our customers that would be coming in to pick freight up. It could be from different brokerages. It could be from different trucking companies, different logistic companies. I get payment notifications. So once we arrive the freight in here to our station, then we… basically send what we call an arrival notice and it lets whoever shipped it know that their freight is on hand, that how much is owed and what needs to be provided in order for them to pick it up, whether it's been cleared by customs. So they may have to have customs paperwork or they may have to, they have to provide proof of payment. So they'll basically take a PDF of the receipt. They have, they'll attach it with any other paperwork. So we can release the freight. So I would have that I have actual messages coming in from the airlines, whether it be… you know, updates for, you know, different airline, like for example, this very top one right here would be there's a temporary power outage in Jamaica. So they're they put an embargo in place for freight going there. So things like that, you know, would be fairly important obviously. But a lot of the things that come through the arrival notices and things like this. And so again, this is a shared box. So when I open that, I want to make sure I go back in and mark that as not read. So anyone else, you know, there's like another 10 or 15 people that are also in this one email box. So being able to see who opens say this or, you know, maybe opens this arrival notice and responds back to it. Like you can see back and forth there's been at least like three emails on here but being able to see who opened this and responded or who opened it and marked it as not read. And then we never reply back to it, how much time that it's taken us to get that reply back to that person because we try to reply at a minimum or I'm sorry, a maximum of two hours. So, you know, obviously, you know, the quicker the better. So I would want to be able to see, you know, who opened these emails, who actually responded to it when they responded, how much time it took them to respond and things like that? Or did they just open it up, see what it was? And then say, oh, I don't want to deal with that and mark it as read or unread to where someone else had to deal with that. So then I'd want to be able to see if there's any, you know, patterns of somebody doing that, you know, quite often where I could address it and be like, hey, look, you can't just open the email and not respond to it, you know, so that's pretty much, you know, the flow of my day, you know, regarding to emails.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Now. My follow up question there is specifically with regards to these four major airlines that you cater to, right? Delta, united, American and Alaska. Yeah. Now, you'd mentioned something about the email address being changed a bit. Could you show me an example of what that looks like? And the reason why I'm asking that is I'm trying to see what's going to be the easiest route to auto, categorize these emails as soon as they're received?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  So, I don't have access to the actual like DL ind at airgeneral. Com that's from like corporate and they just basically add me to that group to where I'm getting it. So, let me see if I can find something that would.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, all I'm looking for is an email received from like delta for instance. So I can see what that email address looks like. That's all.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Okay. Let me see if I can.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let's deliver to united airlines. All right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I mean, it's all right. If we don't have an example, I just wanted to, you know, see if there was any differentiation in the incoming email. And yeah.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  So, these are all being just sent?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  The regular ones, right?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah, I'm not sure where the,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  oh, no, that's fine. I mean, we can still like, you know, check it out at the time of, okay?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  So, here's oh, there we go. Sorry, here's, one from united. Yeah, I'm not sure which one of these hold on.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And you can close out that zoom window and window. I don't think it'll stop the meeting.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Okay. There we go. Okay, perfect. Let's see. So it would probably be this one like right here, the ind. So there's going to be there's. Going to be some stuff kind of like that. And then there's going to also be one where it's actually, you know, it would be UL, ind… at airgeneral. Com that would also be used as well. So, there's several emails that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  That feed in here. I don't know if I can find one.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, I mean, it's fine. It's just a small detail that I wanted you to note. So maybe when we're talking about getting the account created and we have commercial sorted out in parallel. If you could have these email addresses and these groups quite honestly just made a list of then what we can do is have hiver automatically categorize all of these as emails from united, you know, emails from American, and those just show up when the email is received, right? So that could be like one of the steps. Yeah.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  I'll have to kind of dig into it. I mean, the only ones I really truly know are like, you know, the like the UL, ind or whatever. Like those are really the only ones, I know if any of the other airlines use any other kind of that would probably have to come from our it department. You know, they would probably know that more than I would. I don't know how that's all filtered into these mailboxes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. So all hiver would need is the email address, not access to the address, but just like the actual email address or the group or the distribution list or whatever. And that's about what we'll need to get the hiver automations and workflows configured accordingly. Yeah… perfect. So, Jeff, the other thing I remember from last time was within these four major airlines that you catered to. I believe there was a group of like a smaller subset within the team that pretty much prioritizes these, right? Like emails from these clients specifically.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  I don't know what you're saying. Hold on, can you repeat just kind of repeat that real?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Quick. Sorry, no worries.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hello. Yeah. Is it better? Now? Is it clear?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah. It's better.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Perfect. So, what I wanted to find out was in terms of routing emails from these airlines to members within the team? Is there like a special group or like a smaller subset within the 15 member group that only takes care of united or prioritizes united. What does that look like?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  There is, so I think that would probably be where the UL or del, or ua as those would probably, I mean we would probably have to make sure that the employees who work those accounts are on those groups because everything from those groups filters into this one box.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. That makes sense. So with hiver in the mix, we don't technically need any additional team members of yours to be added to the group primarily on Google anymore, because hiver will take care of distributing and making these emails visible to the team members through the shared inbox. All we need to make sure is that they're on hiver and that we've got the right rules created within hiver so that these emails go up to them, directly, right?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah, I can definitely get a list together for what employees carry or cover what airlines. So that's an easy thing.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Sorted. So once that's lined up, could you tell me a little bit about the labels that you've got on the left side and what they mean? How do emails enter those labels?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  So I would probably have to ask jess one of my leads, she kind of set all this up. So I mean some of them are pretty much, you know, so tonnage logs would be where we… record like each shipment, basically what kind of shipment it was, how many pieces, how much it weighed. So that's how we basically invoice the airlines is by the amount of weight and piece count and things like that. So when we go into that, it basically takes you right? Yep. So this would be where we send our invoices in and I think we just save it there. Ucan's, would be, doesn't look like there's anything in there. So it doesn't really matter. I honestly don't know what these labels are set up for or why we have them because I don't necessarily… think any of them are being used. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So talking about future state, then if you did have an option to smart categorize these conversations, right? Aia or workflow based, do you have any categories that would be important? Any types of emails that you'd like to flag up or set up automated reminders for things like that?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  I think obviously we would want something set up for each of the airlines. And then anything that would happen to have anything in the title of the email that says escalated or anything along those lines or help or something to where second request or urgent or anything like that. I would want to make sure that got put into like kind of an escalated type of folder to where, you know, we'd be able to monitor that. So if we see anything that pops into there, then obviously, you know, that's priority. So, yeah, and then another one set up for like you see payment confirmation. Yes, that would probably be something that we would want arrival notices, something we would probably want. I'm trying to think… maybe something like K.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Nine paperwork or K9 screening or screening paperwork.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah, really, I think that those would kind of be some of the big ones. Obviously, we would probably add and maybe tweak it a little bit once we get it up and running.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Totally. So thanks for that note that makes sense. And just one more thing before I switch to the hybrid interface. So you can, you know, look at a visual while you're thinking about this is in terms of the, you know, the outcome of these emails or like the types of emails they are. I'm assuming most of this is just internal in the sense of it comes from our general corporate. And then you respond back to our general corporate. Is that the right understanding or are you actually directly interacting with these airlines?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  So we are directly interacting with these airlines and with these customers, got it. Nothing goes to corporate. The only thing that would ever really go to corporate is if something gets escalated above me. So, you know, it's basically the buck stops at me. And if it's something that, you know, requires higher escalation, then I would go to my regional or higher. So, yeah, no, all of these emails are dealt with at the local level here at the station.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Station level, got it. And these are emails directly from customers. Makes sense, correct? Sorted. So for now, I think that kind of gives me a good enough starting point. And thanks for these specific pointers, right? What I'd like to do now is switch to sharing my screen instead, right? And, you know, we'll start running through the hiver experience. Feel free to stop me if you have any questions or want to, you know, talk about anything in particular. But, yeah.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Okay. Give me one second. I want to get my lead just so she can kind of see how this is going to work. Take your time. Give me just one second.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. Yeah. Let me know when you're ready.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  I want you to see.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  So he's doing a demo on the hiver system that I've been talking about. So it basically kind of shows how they… like the different categories and how it works behind the scenes kind of thing. So if you got a minute, we'll just you can go ahead and continue.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thanks, Jeff. Hey, hi, pleasure meeting you. I didn't catch your name. This is, Jessica. Hi, Jessica. All right. So, Jessica and Jeff, this is what a normal hiver account that's at scale across teams and departments would look like. In your case, this is probably going to be a little more straightforward in terms of things. Now, what we'll effectively do with hiver is primarily start by connecting your email address, right? The teamind at email address, right to the shared mailbox. And then from there, we'd start working with you and setting up workflows, making the whole thing easier and ensuring you're always on track of what's happening. So, in all of your everyday scenarios, you're going to see ind show up on the left side, like you see customer success and finance, and so on, right? And the everyday experience is going to be in such a way where when you start your day, you're going to have one single place called the unassigned and that's going to be where every new email that's sent or received in ind shows up in. This is going to be a list of conversations or emails that are yet to be delegated yet to be picked up by different members in the team. And so, just to show you like a full experience of the flow, what you get is the unassigned view that's open visibility across the team. So everybody can see the number of emails in unassigned, and be able to see the actual emails as well whenever they want to. Now, from here, you've got two ways of going about it. Now, depending on the categorization, the routing mechanism, depending on which team members are handling, delta, Alaska, united, American, and so on. And so forth. We can automate a lot of these delegation and email categorization on a typical perspective, if there's a conversation from a customer that doesn't fall under these four major airlines. And what you can do as a team is basically open a conversation. You're going to start seeing this tree on the right side and that's going to be your hiver tree where you do every hiver related action. First thing that's going to happen is you can select from the dropdown in terms of who should be handling it of passing ownership of the whole email conversation. The moment that happens, the email starts moving through the queues, and it will continue being visible to everybody in the hiver team at all times, right? So, your team on hiver is always going to have this visibility. It's going to move from unassigned into a mind queue. This. Is dynamic and it's individual to the person logged in at that point of time, which means they see their emails under mine. Each of you will see your individual emails there. The team view. On the other hand is where you go to see, hey, what's the entire team working on? And irrespective of who an email is assigned to, anybody can just pop it open, see what the conversation is about and pretty much continue discussion from there. Right now within the team view where you're tracking open conversations across the team. You're also going to be able to do like a quick workload distribution visualizer, you can filter it like ascending descending and effectively, this is a way for you to quickly filter down to just one individual's emails and then start tracking it in detail and see what's happening inside. So that will be the first part of hiver which is once connected to ind, every email shows up in unassigned. This is how you can delegate the email or assign it and how you're able to track it after that. Once the assignment happens, the next thing that you would typically do is want to send out a reply on that email, right? But before you do that, you can start either having automations on hiver, do these categories… and also be able to manually change and add them. Now, you have two ways of categorizing things on hiver, one is called a tag and look at the tags as more of a, you know, an umbrella category or a top level category in terms of what that email is about, towards the outcome you'd look to achieve there. So you can have as many tags, look at this as similar to labels and folders in Gmail. For comparison. And when it comes to detailed tracking and more in depth categorization and next steps tracking, you can build out a whole network of dropdowns, text based fields, date based fields. And that could then help you track additional information on that email. This could be for example, things like, hey, what type of email is it? Is it? A payment confirmation? An arrival notice, a canine screening, you know, proof of payment, things like that. Now, once that's done, what effectively happens is as your team is making the changes and working on the email, right from assignment, changing the status and even updating these categories. All of that is going to be visible and automatically tracked as part of the activity log over here. It's right here at the bottom and you can pop it open anytime. These are all activity logs of actions happening. They're non editable. And they're always going to be attached to a person. Doing these actions along with a date and timestamp of when these actions are being done. So at any point, if you want to run a quick audit and you want to understand, hey, for example, why did this email take longer than 10 hours to be replied to? That's your drill down level granularity on every single conversation that you have… from here, when it comes to a standard response, you've got it categorized. You've got it aligned with next steps and additional details that you want to track. And so when you're ready, you go with the reply. And over there, you've got two options, right? One is you can either type out a reply from scratch, send it out standard route. There. We've got a way that lets you like compose better with AI, you know, make it professional fix grammar and all of that. It's one route of doing it. The other way of doing it is going to be purely driven by hiver's. Ask AI or copilot that we have here. And what this is basically a way to help agents draft replies really quick and fast. And the best part is this can be made contextual. So instead of having a generic AI that tries to give you a general answer, you can pretty much add your process documents, your knowledge sources, your faqs, and things like that to the copilot's training model. And that would help your team have more clearer responses including internal terminology. So in this case, I've asked AI to give me a reply that requests for additional information before I can give a suggestion or an answer. So the AI has now drafted this answer. And in drafting the answer, it's actually gone through the knowledge sources that I've uploaded based on which it's told me, hey, this seems like the perfect one. Now, if I'm not satisfied with this, I can just be like refine it and make it short include, you know, just basically keep conversing back and forth to give it additional instructions. So it can give you that right answer or that close to perfect answer depending on the data sources, the process documents, and everything you've got, right? So that's another way of having responses crafted really quickly. Now when you're ready insert, it becomes a draft that your team can just review and send out in one click. This little part here is going with an upgrade on Monday, like an update to hiver on Monday. So it's just here for today. It should be out by Monday, which means from Monday, the replies once inserted would look like this. All your team needs to do is just quickly fact check. The data inside and we're ready, send it out. I'm just going to take a pause here to see if you're both tracking so far and if you had any questions.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  I got it. It seems like once we get everything, you know, more set up that, you know, it's just going to be a couple of clicks. Like for our arrival notices, those are kind of a generic, you know, arrival notice. And all we do is basically change the airline and then, you know, obviously the pricing and a few things in there. So being able to automate that and have one set up already for each airline and just have to click it and, you know, basically add the airway bill or whatever to it. It's kind of what we do already. We keep a draft in our draft folder and then we just copy and paste it. So this would, you know, ultimately make it a lot easier once everything's in place.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely, yes. And an additional way of sending replies like you said, you know, you've got it on your drive folder, you copy paste it. You could pretty much put it as email templates as well. So if you're going to be looking at AI, you could have these templates pre configured. And the difference here is that these templates can have these placeholder values. So like you said, right? United bump in the airline name, change the details and pre include attachments as well. If that's relevant. That way, the template could be used instead of the copilot depending on your preference and the type of information and answer that is right now, when it comes to sending out these replies. And this is usually going to be the first change in terms of how your team has been working so far to the hiver way of working is that you're not going to have statuses that will help you track the stage or the completion of an email conversation. Two ways of changing a status, right? You can just type out your reply. And when you're sending the email, move it to either closed or pending stage. Alternatively you can also change the status from the right panel here. Open pending and closed. Are your three options. Now, the way they work is you could basically look at it as closing an email is equivalent to archiving it once it's done. In your typical Gmail scenario. Now, you don't have something for pending in Gmail, but the pending status in hiver could be used as an in between status. For example, you've got information. I mean, you've got a question, but to complete the answer or send out a reply, you need additional information from other departments or other stakeholders. You can post that email in pending. And that way you've revisited when ready. The other aspect of hiver is that the unassigned mine and team where you track active tasks that's going to be tied to the statuses. Only open emails show up in these three views. Anything that is pending or closed, basically go to their dedicated views. The reason they kept here and not available in Gmail. By default, you can customize it. But the reason we've got it down there instead is because any reply on a pending or a closed email will auto open the conversation, which means I no longer have to track. I mean 20 emails in my open status, I could instead type out the reply, send it out. And when the customer needs to follow up with me or needs to have additional details configured, they can just drop a reply on the same thread. Hiver will automatically reopen it under my name or. Whoever it's assigned to. So that will also help your team keep the active queue clearer and more relevant in terms of the actual active conversations there. So that's how the statuses work by default. Now going from here, sort of jumping back into the replying side of things. You've got another option that's going to help you work better together as a team. This ties in with a scenario where as an agent, I've started typing out a reply. And I'm not entirely sure of all the information that I need to include here. For instance, I have two questions on an incoming email. I know the answer for one but I don't know what the answer for the second one is. So I can create something called a shared draft that allows you as a team to share a drafted reply without having to forward or CC that internally. I'm just going to put that in there just to show you what that's like one, two, yes, share draft and that basically gets created and attached to the conversation. It's like my internet's wonky, or something. So. But yeah, essentially just to show you that experience of the shared draft, I'm just going to pick a different email where I'm sure one might be there. Yeah. So this one at the top here is what we call the shared draft. The advantage of having this is other members in the team can jump in, edit the draft, drop changes and update it and even send it out if needed. So now internal discussions no longer have to include additional emails about things. It can just be an appended message or an appended draft here on the actual conversation that brings me to the next part which is once you've got a draft like this, how do you notify the other members of the team that you need their help? And this email needs their attention. So that's where this notes section on the right side comes in handy. Think of it like at mentioning somebody on like a slack or hangouts or something like that. It's basically at mentioning person by name. So tell them what you need help with, right? And that's about it on the receiving end. What's going to happen is these people that you tag or assign emails to are all going to start seeing notifications like this? Somebody mentioned you in a note, somebody assigned you a conversation, all of that stuff and for them to go from this alert to the actual email, it's just one click. They find the alert, click on it and they're brought straight to that conversation, right? So that's how simple it is to switch between conversations. And have a clear trail at the same time of who's requesting help, who's additionally involved in completing an email task. And the best part is everything that you do on hiver, share drafts these little notes, all of these activity logs, and everything is fully private and only visible to your hiver team. Which means your clients and customers at the end of the day, they're not even going to have an idea that you're using hiver because for them, the experience remains the same. They send you an email, your team sends out an email back and that's about it. All right. So another pause to see again if there's any other questions or doubts before I continue.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  No, I don't think so. It's going to take us time to obviously get in and get used to everything and, you know, definitely going to take some time.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. And that's where Jessica and Jeff, Jessica from hiver's side would be working closely with you after, you know, after today's call. Basically, we'll be lining up training sessions, onboarding, calls, workflow configuration, sessions and ensure that everybody on the team has a clear grasp of hiver and we keep working with you continually to make the optimization easier, right? So that's the second thing. So coming back to everyday email management, that would be the typical flow of how somebody in the team is now going to be able to see the email, open it, take it over for themselves or assign it to a different person and how you all as a team can track completion replies and collaborate. Better. Now, when it comes to any email inbox, you're going to definitely need more than the five defaults unassigned all the way to pending. And the second thing is Jeff, you'd mentioned that you'd want to try to track against to our first response time at least from a sense of understanding where effort is being spent for the team, right? So for both these fronts, what we would be doing is essentially helping you configure these advanced settings or additional settings. Now, the first one is going to be the SLA, because that's going to be very straightforward to create. You can basically create multiple SLA policies. So you're not restricted to just one. And the difference between these policies would rely on the tags or the categories that we'll be setting up for you. So to your point, Jeff, if we have AI or a workflow on hiver, automatically escalate urgent emails, priority, emails from the top four clients, anything of that sort, then what you could do is basically say hiver, hey, I've got these four tags that I'm using for priority and high priority conversations. And if any email enters these four tags, I want the first reply to go out within two hours, resolution to happen within 24. And if either of these timers are not met first response or resolution, notify these people in the team along with Jeff as the team lead. So you do have that level of control where you can individually pick who should be notified at what time. And it's not mandatory that you need to have both response and resolution, you could just have it for response as well. You can also run these timers only during business hours. So during outside business hours, nobody's bothered. And you don't come back on Monday for instance, to like a sea of notifications. And the added advantage here, is there's also an upcoming timer that can be helpful for the agents that are working on this email. So for instance, if two hour is the limit for which you want to track first response, then you can have hiver send out a notification to the agent in charge at the one hour 30 minute mark saying, hey, you have 30 minutes left and this email's looking close to the two hour mark, see if you can reprioritize this, right? An example of that alert will look like this upcoming SLA alert for it's going to show that subject to that email, right? That's what that looks like. Again, one click on the alert and the agents will be able to see that email. So, yeah, so that would be the SLA part of things and how straightforward it's going to be to set up, you can either have an SLA that runs across the board and then different timers for types of emails and client based, or you could have just client based and type based or always running going by how your team is setting up. Hiver. Now, once the slas are configured that's where automation, so workflows pretty much start stepping in now, Jeff, you'd mentioned or at least from the discussion so far, the first few automations that we'd be recommending or I'd recommend for your team is going to be firstly based on emails that are being received. So what we do is first example classify and categorize everything as the type of email. It is right? So if we're going by the four major airlines, then what I'd recommend is doing something like this where you say here whenever an email is received or sent, check if the from address contains any of and we basically stack up the DL hyphen UL, hyphen, and so on. And so forth. Right? So once you have those email address, you just stack it in here and you say, hey, hiver, if I receive an email and these are the email addresses for any of those, then hiver should automatically add a tag and categorize it accordingly, right? Additionally, I'd ask you if there were a smaller subset within the team who would take care of this. So what you can also do and assign among which is basically a round Robin between the select group of team members. So the way I would be building this out in due course is saying, if an email is received and it's got any of the delta airlines group aass there, then add the delta airlines as the category and assign it or round Robin it between these three people. You're going to have further controls that you can do. Whoops. Sorry, you have further controls that you can do like a pure round Robin which basically ignores workloads and just goes one email at a time for the team. Or you can do load balancing where it tries to equalize the active email count between the team members based on the volume of incoming emails, right? You can have this as one of the workflows that would be suggesting to get things going easier. The second type of workflow would be based on the SLA policy. You can say, hey, if the first response time SLA policy is violated, and the policy I'm looking for is top four clients. For instance. Then as well, you could set up an automation that reads something like, okay, if these SLA policies are violated, then I want hiver to first check the status of that email because that's going to be how you track completion at this point. And we can be like, hey, if the SLA policy is violated and the status is not closed, which means they have marked it as resolved. So if it's still open and the policy is violated, it's typically when it happens. And along with the status, I also want you to look at, you know, maybe a second level of classification which is priority, which could be the type of inquiry it is or to your point, again, Jeff, the kind of documents they'd need to go pick up the freight once it's arrived, a lot of these could be fed into hiver and you could start creating workflows like this SLA policy is your primary check afterwards. You're looking at, is the email still open? Is the priority high? Is the type of inquiry, a canine screening, a customs clearance receipt, whatever that is. And then you can have hiver do a bunch of actions. Again. Some of the common actions people do is basically send a hiver notification to the team leads as one thing or have this sent out as an additional email. If you want to get to see that part as well. Yeah. Well, what people normally do is in these cases have a custom reply that they've templated for this scenario saying apologize for the delay. We'll get back to you at the earliest. So that way the agent doesn't have to type out this one email, stay on top of it. Remember system can just send this out only when the SLA policy is reached based on your times and based on your conditions. And hiver can be like, all right, I'm sending the email at the same time. I'm also recategorizing it, you know, adding it a different tag, calling it a definitely an urgent issue. So on and so forth, right? So that's some of the ways in which we can help you create workflows on hiver that rely on how you would like to track these things in terms of conversations and completion going forward. I know I spoke quite a lot about the workflow builder here. So another quick pause to see if you had any questions or had any initial thoughts about workflows and how they could be created on hiver?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  No, I mean I think it's going to be good once we get everything set up. Obviously, there's going to be a lot of back end work to be done before you know, it's all in place. But being able to track things like that and be able to assign is going to be really good. And even the auto responses for certain emails will be good. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. And so from here, the only other piece that I want to also highlight is that sending out replies, adding a tag. What you can also do with hiver is you can also have hiver set up to remind people internally. So that could work in a way where if an email is pending or if you're basing it off of the client reply, where you know that for example, if it's a free delivery, you've sent out the information and the client has to reply within 48 hours, for instance, then you can be like, hey, I'm waiting on an external reply. And what I want hiver to do is check if the external reply is received on these types of, emails that are tagged a certain way. For example, again, we're going to the same example where we'll say, all right, united, check for external replies on emails from united and alert the team if the time since that, the time has passed since is 48 hours. So basically, if your team sends out an email to united in a certain category or they receive something from united and they've responded to it and they're waiting on action from that customer, you can be like, hey, I want hiver to notify the agent on file that this email has been, it's been 24 hours and nobody's replied. So maybe you want to send a follow up, change the status automatically. So it shows at the top of their active working. But you can do additional stuff like this as well to ensure that you always have more than one way of tracking everything across the board when it comes to email communication. So that will be the automation builder. You've also got a few elements of AI that you could use here. And from a general AI perspective, the copilot piece was the one I showed where two clicks, it drops the answer. We can also help you train the AI as well for running the categories as well. So you don't necessarily have to go by the workflows I showed you earlier. We could just train the AI to automatically categorize them as the type of inquiry, the nature of inquiry and things like that and use the workflows just for more deterministic stuff like, hey, if it's from these addresses, it's for delta, if it's from these addresses, it's for united and so on. And so forth. And Jeff, I wanted to ask you one more thing. Are there cases where you'd need to drop approvals or have something approved before the team can send out information?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So then that's another thing that you could configure where you're basically saying, you know, you can simple straightforward step by step rule. These people that are approvers that you select here, don't always need to be on hiver. Meaning you could have non hiver users as well as part of this approval flow. Essentially, you'll create a multi step flow here with the preferred people. What will happen is when an email hits a stage where it needs that approval, we can again go by a workflow and automate the whole thing or have it manually be added by the team. Once something's added, automatically kicks off emails to the people involved saying, hey, we need your approval and they can just click a button and say, approve or decline and that flows back here. And based on the approval or the lack thereof, you could again set up rules to track that better. And from a general sense of the hiver experience perspective customization wise, you can create more of these categories. Again, think of it similar to the labeling foldering mechanism in Gmail. So now, if you want to filter everything from united that's based on payment confirmation in one place, you can have something like that configured. If you want to configure everything that's general refund related or proof of payment related, that could be made into a separate space as well. And you could typically customize the entire hiver experience. So when you start your day looking into the ind mailbox on hiver, you're looking straight at the set of emails that you would be responsible for as you start your day. On the other hand, there's going to be fully fleshed out reporting dashboards and everything of that sort. That will help build out for you. And just to show you a snapshot like a quick little… summary of what these are like. If you go for the dashboards, you're looking at basically over level information that's easily understandable. These can be set up based on response time across the team, response time, based on the categories or tags, status, grouping, resolutions grouped by assignee and a lot of these when it comes to the general reporting depth of hiver, you could for example run an entire user base 360 where you're tracking at the agent level. What is the performance like same for the tag based or the category based as well? So if my manager for instance, wants to see what I've been up to the last one week on my inbox, he can pull this up and he'll see. Okay, I've got two active emails assigned to me. I've sent. A one reply, these are my handling times and these are my csat scores. If all of these are included. And in terms of the granularity within each report, I'll be able to see right down to the conversations individually that contribute to my handling time or resolution time as a whole, right? Type of response, timestamps, time it took the whole bit, got a whole array of filters that you can use to make the reporting better, build out custom reports. So it's again one click access or do dashboards or maybe even have both depending on your preference. You always have this data handy. And if at any point you feel like you wanna also work on reports outside of hiver, you could even schedule an exported CSV file consisting of your filtered data and deliver to you at a frequency of your preference. So that's the reporting side of hiver. Jeff. I wanted to pause on reporting, see if there was any specific metric you were curious if hiver can track?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  No, I mean, I think really our biggest thing is gonna be the first response and then the follow up response times and things of that nature. So, I mean it's gonna be pretty generic as far as what we're tracking.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So then hiver's definitely got you covered both from a general response time perspective and from an sle backed response resolution time perspective as well, right? You've got both those reports. And so, yeah, that would effectively be the overall hiver experience and the kind of differences that your team can expect when it comes to the Gmail first route you've been working on. There's. Also a lot of smaller elements here. Like, for example, you know, if the same person emails you more than once and you wanna quickly reference the past emails that's at a click of a button right here, open the email, open the hiver tray, click the yellow page kind of icon called the contact module that basically lists out the top 15 past conversations with a click to expand view that will basically give you the entire subset, right? Filed by full email address and filed by domain. The same thing is also built into an entire module where you can go and track at the customer, company level by domain or at the customer contact level by email address. And you pretty much get to see all the conversations that you have access to that the systems have received in your hiver inbox. General search works the same way but it's now more powerful. So you get to search for stuff just within hiver search only within hiver notes as you start adopting that better. And all of these just make navigating the inbox and getting to the right conversations all the more simpler and easier as you go.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Ahead. And with that said Jeffrey and Jessica, those were the main things that I thought I'd walk you by on today's call, check if there are any other questions and understand what we would like to do in terms of next steps for your team. I'm working with Kenneth on the commercials. I'm waiting on a final head count from him, but I wanted to see if you had any plans in mind or what that looks like.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  No, I mean we definitely want to move forward but we, I think it's still, you know, Ken's got to make those calls and things like that. So, yeah… I mean, we're definitely, I definitely want to implement it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood, Jeff, one last question for you. Is there any kind of timeline by when you prefer having hiver rolled out and ready?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  No, I mean we're in no super rush. I mean, obviously, you know, I would like to get it in place, you know, fairly quick. But yeah, I mean it's not like a super priority though.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. No, that makes sense. All right. So what I'll do Jeff is after the call, I'll bundle the whole recording, send it over. So you have this for reference and I'll continue my parallel discussion with Ken on the head count and have commercials sorted out. And in parallel, we can definitely get your team set up on hiver as well. So let me have that discussion with Ken and I'll you know, drop a note when we have a little more clarity on that and how we can get your team started.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Great. Sounds good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant, Jessica. Any other questions from your side? I'm good. Thank you. All right, folks. Thank you so much to the both of you for today's. Call, hope you both have a great weekend.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  You too. Take care.
