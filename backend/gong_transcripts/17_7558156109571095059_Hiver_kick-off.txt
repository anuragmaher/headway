================================================================================

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  hi, Jenn. Morning. Hello? Good.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Morning. Hi.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Jenn. Nice to see you again. Thanks for jumping on. I wanted to sort of like be here and like I said, I will be part of the evaluation here. So, the setup here for the next couple of weeks while we're coordinating… your reporting, which I do have an update about. Okay. But in the meantime, first and foremost, I do wanted to introduce udita who is going to be your dedicated success person. She's been with us for a while. She's one of our top reps and you're in great hands with her. And so she's essentially, of course, I'll let her like set an agenda, but her objective would be to make sure long story short that you and the team are like all of your boxes are ticked and everything that you need, you're getting out of the account and the setup and just ensure that we're delivering as much value as possible.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Excellent. Hi, nice to meet you.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Hi, hi, lovely to meet you too, Jenn. And thanks, Jeevan. And as Jeevan mentioned, you know, I am going to be your success manager at hiver and my responsibility would be to ensure that you're getting the most out of hiver. So, from a product perspective features functionalities, optimizing your usage, I'll be your go to person for all of that. I'm really looking forward to working with you.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Me too. And I apologize. I'm not on video this morning. I will be in future meeting. I'm just recovering from a back injury. So I'm trying to avoid having everyone watching me wince and fade out the call.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Udita was telling me about one on her side as well just now.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh my goodness. Yeah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I mean, I just keep saying that we're all on different boats in the same tsunami.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  So… sounds about right. Well, I'm very excited to get this kicked off. I had thought we were going to include either Ron or Amy but we don't necessarily need to, it may be a good idea. Let me see if Ron is available to join.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Just for like he has access, I do not have, so, I think, and actually, where is this? Let me see, oh, he's in a meeting until nine 30. So, I think he and Amy are in a meeting together actually, hold on one moment,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We can give you access if required.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yeah, no, that's fine. I just, Ron oversees all of our it. So it's always good for an initial kickoff like this. It's always good to have him around just to make sure that we are setting things up on the front.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. And if that was on me for not including him, my apologies, but we'll make sure that we include him on future calls as well. In the meantime, Jenn, I did want to give you an update on the reporting hours that you had. I've already discussed with udita and she's very familiar. Oh, great. And she already told me that she's got a few other customers asking for the same thing which we've managed to set up. So we've discussed with our product team as well and we will be able to sort of build a solution for you around that. And my product person wanted to jump in today and actually understand exactly the specifics of what you want to see in there and how you want it configured. But he is unfortunately calling sick today, so maybe we'll get him involved in the next call, but it's very much a ball that is moving and we're committed to sort of delivering that for you guys. So it is something that I will be udita while udita gets you guys started with the onboarding and everything. I will run point on the product task internally and I will drop by with updates of course, with udita and Cece.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  All right, excellent.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Thank you.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I'm glad to hear it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Amazing. So I will be in touch for sure. I do, I am double booked this morning, so I'm going to have to drop. I'm going to hand it over to udita to maybe set an agenda and then maybe talk you through what's going to happen in the next couple of calls with hopefully Ron and Amy and the rest of the team as well. And of course, I'm going to continue to be involved. So if there's anything I can help with, let me know.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate you setting this up.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Udita, keep me posted. I'm just going to make you host.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks. Okay. All right. And I saw.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Your email yesterday, and I saw this. I was in back to back meetings yesterday, so I wasn't able to respond. I'm like, I know we already have one scheduled. Hopefully she sees it.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. When Jeevan added me to this call, I said, oh, I just wrote an email, but great. Thanks for adding me to the call. I don't have to go ahead and schedule another one myself. So that's fantastic. So typically, what I normally do on the first call is try and get an understanding of your use case, having said that I have in fact, in your particular case received a basic understanding in terms of your primary reasons for using hiver, what are you looking to achieve et cetera, from Cole? He shared a fairly detailed explanation et cetera. But I think and yeah, and on these calls, I typically also go ahead and help with setting up the account mailboxes users. Now, when I looked at your account, it's already set up. So thank you for making my job easy.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Well, there's more to set up. So this just so that you are fully looped in. So normally, I know you guys do like a seven to 10 day trial and we asked for a longer trial because we have a lot of variables at play and we wanted to make sure that we really understood how everything was going to work together. So that's partially why we have so much kind of already done because we've had this for three weeks or something. And then, yes. So the mailboxes that we have set up are a small selection of the total picture.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So,

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  okay.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  We will go ahead and set up more of your mailboxes and any additional users that you might want to. But before doing that, while I, you know, like I said, I did get a good handover from Cole. I would love to hear it from you. In fact, you know, if I were to ask you why hiver, like, you know, I looked at some of your mailboxes. I obviously looked up your account, your company, and I can see that this is probably you want a mailbox per client, but I'm not going to assume that, right? If you can tell me what's you know, what's your primary reason for using hiver for choosing hiver, what's the goal here? Like what would be your key objective?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yes, I am happy to share that. So in the… current or prior to having hiver trial and all of this, we have been functioning for quite some time having multiple programs. So the way that we call our clients, we have each client and we have a, we call our part of the business is program business. So we develop… E stores for our clients to sell their merchandise. Or I mean we've got several different that's a super simplified version of the whole thing. So we have an online marketplace and my team here, our customer experience leads support the end users when they're on those E store platforms. So they're on the individual E stores. They all have, each store has its own inbox. And, and then we have a team of three dedicated customer experience leads that share amongst all of them. And then we have two others that we'll need to add to this account that are kind of our backups. They're our order management team and they step in whenever workload gets heavy or if someone's out of the office or whatnot, and then that's kind of the overall. But the biggest reason why we reached out and tried to find a better solution was that we were utilizing Google groups. And the way that Google groups works is kind of inhibiting… us from being able to really get an understanding of what's actually needed to have attention. So, all of these orders, all of these programs have E comm orders coming through and each inbox gets a copy of the order confirmation, that's sent to the user. And then every status update or, you know, shipment notice or whatnot, those stock emails that are sent to update the end user, are copied in the inbox in our group inbox. And with Google groups, you're not able to archive or hide or close or get those out of the view. So when we have some of our bigger programs that are busier, can have 100 orders at a day, you know, like where you're coming through. So you have all of these orders that come in new order confirmations. And then if you're having 100 orders a day, you've got 400 orders from the past four days that are now having shipment notifications. So all of those emails were basically clogging up the view of our customer experience leads. So that when an end user actually just manually emailed someone and said, hey, I have a question or I need help or I need an exchange or whatnot, it was getting lost in the fray. So we weren't able to identify that the response rate was really low and there was frustration happening both on the end user, our team and our sales team who is representing or working with the main client and hearing negative feedback from those end users. So it was really getting to a point where we're like, okay, we have to have a better solution and that's the biggest crux of it. And then there's all these other features that also were really difficult to do or handle in Google groups like identifying if someone was out of the office, like someone else has to jump in. And then it not only does the main person have to weed through all the stuff that's in there. Now, you have someone who isn't 100 percent expert on that account. They're just covering for the day and they have to try and figure out, okay, what's what, and what has been answered and where is it? You know, there's just, it was just so difficult. And then take that aside and look at the leadership aspect of it. And we have no visibility to how many emails our team is actually responding to or writing in a day, how many, you know, I mean, I have reporting on the phone structure and that end of it. So I know what's happening on phones in the chat, but I don't have any visibility to what my team is doing and how they're performing, and if they're drowning or if they're if they have space to take on new accounts or whatnot, like I just don't have any visibility. So when we looked at hiver, and those things were kind of built in already and available to be set up. It was, it was a really interesting aspect. And then trying it and working through that trial, it showed that it was able to do the things that we wanted it to do. The biggest piece for me on my, in my individual team members experience was it immediately saved time in setting up the automations to close out those stock emails that they don't need to look at and having all of their assigned inboxes be able to automate and assign to them. And then have those emails that actually need action show up in the assigned to me folder and they can work from one space instead of having to jump through 15 different inboxes. Like those two things were just top of the list, the visibility. Well, I guess there's three things that visibility time saving and that efficiency of being able to work from one space.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Thank you so much. First of all, thank you Jenn for sharing all of that. And yes, 100 percent rather than building an in house solution to solve all of these problems where you would have to employ engineers and do a lot of QA testing and smoke testing and try and see whether it's working, not working et cetera. I think using an out of the box solution like hiver, where we are doing all of the grunt work for you… definitely that's the smart decision. Having said that when you talked about the challenges that you were facing, I will in fact, in just a short while ask to look at your account. But before that, some of the things that I can think of, we can have one, we can look at tags. I'm not sure if you've had a chance to look at tags on hiver, but we have lots of different tags. What we can do with tags is we can prioritize, we can say that, you know, this needs to go to X. So different types of tags can be used. One can be on a team basis. One can be on a client basis. One can be on a priority level basis. So multiple different ways. And then you can filter by those tags. So that is one way that we can utilize it. And also we can automate a lot of your processes. So for example, like you mentioned, right? That if somebody, you know, somebody's out of office and, you know, someone else is filling in for this person. Now, one, we have everything on the activity panel. So, you know, exactly what's been going on, right?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  That's a great feature.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  And that also gives you a lot of transparency. So from a managerial perspective as well, right? You know, who is changing the status, who is adding the tags and so on. And we can automate all of these processes to save time. So if someone else is filling in, they have access to the information already. They don't have to move back and forth across different mailboxes and reach out to folks and some of the other things since we're talking about out of office, you know, one thing that I personally find useful is in the notes section when you type at and all the names of all the users comes up, those who are currently available or in office is in green and those who are currently marked as out of office is in red.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  So that's nice.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So when we look at your account, we can go ahead and enable that as well. And if I, for example, you know, I'm working on a high priority account, they need an answer immediately. Well, I will add mention someone, you know, who is currently available rather than mention someone and be like, oh, are they there? They're not replying? They're not available, what's going on? So especially for me, you know, I'm working remotely. I don't see my colleagues in the office. So it's very useful that way. So that's there apart from that, sorry you were saying, sorry.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I just said that's great. Thank you.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Sure. And apart from that, you know, you mentioned about the email content, have you had a chance to look at hiver templates?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  On the hiver email templates? Yes. So yes, just briefly, I don't think, I think we've only set one up because I wanted to actually do it a little more thoughtfully than just transfer the ones like have everybody just send me the email templates they have already. I mean, I probably will still do that as like a baseline and say, you know, because everybody has created their own individual ones. And then I'd like to create a template that is team, you know. So anyone who's filling out will still respond the exact same way or filling in. So, yes, email templates definitely need to utilize that and set those up.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So I'll give you a small example from my personal experience. So right now horrible condition. Can't really type, can't work too well? So I have set up my email templates, the email that you would have received yesterday, that was a templatized email. When a new customer is introduced to me, obviously, I'm going to look at their account, see what's going on etc. But rather than type out an entire email, if I know that this is a template that I drafted, and anything I draft is going to look the same because I'm the one that's doing the drafting. So.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Why not?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Use that template, right? And the best part with hiver is that you can create your own email templates and keep it just for yourself or you can create an email template and share it with everyone or with select individuals. So, you know, that really helps because say, for example, from the customer success team, my manager has created certain email templates and he expects that we adhere to those. So those are the standardized templates, right? But I also have some emails like for example, an introductory email that I sent which, you know, my manager doesn't necessarily need to look into that, right? I'm sure he trusts me enough to send an email. So I.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  have.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  those templates of my own, so you can ensure that the communication that your clients are receiving are standardized while simultaneously giving enough flexibility to your team to have their own templates. So that is again something that you could do. And there's multiple other features. You know, one thing that you also mentioned Jenn is, I think the order management team and the customer facing team. So which all teams would be using hiver if I may ask?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  So the customer experience lead that's the role that will be the main user, the main team that is using this platform or using hiver. And then our order management team. Well, I take that back. We have three people on both teams, three customer experience leads, three order management folks. One of our order management folks is going to readily use hiver. Probably in her just in her day to day because she handles all of the order approvals and making sure that once an order is placed, it doesn't get snagged anywhere in the system. And then if there is ever communication with the end user that's needed. So something comes through there's an address error. Something's on backorder. We need a replacement, something. She is going into the group email and responding to that user, reaching out for updated information, whatnot, so she, on the order management side, her name is Ren. She will be using that on a regular basis. Customer experience leads will be every day all day. And then the other two order management folks are our backup team. So they, their regular job, they don't necessarily need to be in groups or in these shared inboxes. But they do cover when anyone's out of the office or when anyone, when the workload gets really heavy, they'll jump in and be like, hey, we need an extra hand.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And I noticed that there are currently nine users who've been added to your hiver account. I believe you mentioned there's three on each of the two teams. They.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Might have already been set up, Ron probably included them. Do you have everyone's name?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I can read it out to you. I think.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Well, you know what I can tell you right now, nine is where we're at, so that's that should be everybody. We should have test user. Yes, myself, Amanda Blanchard. She's our vice president of program of our team, and then we have the three customer experience leads. We have crystal, Carrie and sue Ren is our order management associate, who will be every day. And then Jessica and Natalie are our backups. So that should be everyone.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I do not see Jessica hang on or am I just misreading? So here's, how you can see your users, would you be comfortable, would you be comfortable sharing your screen? So I can just take a look at your account and also, you know, your user list and, you know, mailboxes and so on. If you're comfortable. Yeah.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Just don't judge my inbox with 178 unread emails.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, my gosh. No, like I said, same tsunami, all of us are just flowing in.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Right. Oh, goodness. Okay. Hold on one moment. Let me see and you just, you need to see my, do you need to see, I can?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I can guide you where to click so just the screen.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  So, if I, but if I just share my entire screen, that's easiest cause that way if I have to flip back and forth with anything.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. Whatever you're comfortable with Jenn. I'm okay with anything.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Well, I know when we use the screen sharing, I always advise people to use to share entire screen that way. If you have to flip to a different tab, yeah, the share follows.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, absolutely. Absolutely. So here's what I'm going to do on your top, right? You see this icon here? Yeah. And I see that your out of office is enabled. Now, you click on admin panel, please. It is, you're out of office. Otherwise, this, icon would not show up.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh, you mean to be able to set people?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yes. How it works, is you set yourself as available or away? But as you are an admin, Jenn, you can also go ahead and set other people as available or away. So, if you can just click this?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I'll get this out of the way. Let's do this.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  And you can see it says client services at the very top.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh, yes.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So, this is the mailbox. So this will all be on a mailbox basis. So, at hiver, we work on a mailbox basis. So you can select the appropriate mailbox, I think based on your use case, everybody's going to be part of all the mailboxes, yes, that.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Should be, that should be correct. Everyone should have access to all the mailboxes, and then we just have the assigned with the automation set up to kind of designate the lead for each.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So, what happens is as the admin, you can select the mailbox and just turn any one person that's not yourself as away just temporarily.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Whoops. Sorry, hold on that's okay. I just don't want to sue because she's the one who's actively in there. Let's put Amanda as away. Yeah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So now, before you mark it, just don't click anything. This is something that I want to highlight which is now this user will not be assigned any conversation via auto assignment or automations. So when the user is away, they will not be assigned anything and conversations will be moved to the unassigned folder. If a new reply is received while the user is away. Now, this is because of the setting made at your end for out of office and you can go ahead and make changes out there where you have more flexibility. What that means is even if the user is away, the conversation continues to be assigned to them, it just shows them as the user as away. So someone else can of course fill in for them. But the entire conversation say, for example, someone is managing a project or, you know, handling a particular query, maybe they're out sick one day. Now, that doesn't mean that you take the ownership away from them. So it will continue to be assigned to them unless they have decided that they don't want to keep it assigned. Usually that's for a long period of time, maybe for a week or two weeks if somebody is missing or on maternity or something that's a different issue. So we can cancel this and I can show you where you can make those changes. So you can close this on the top, right? Please. Yeah. And could you click on the out of office one more time for me? Please? Just because since we're on this page, I thought, you know, might as well now, of course, in a way is easy to understand. The other thing is set yourself away until this is where you can set a custom now personally for me because I work remotely say, you know, I have to take a walk or I have to go grab a coffee or I'm feeling like, you know, I'm like drowning in work and I just need a breather. So what I can do is click on the dropdown.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  This is great.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  And click on custom.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh, custom here. Sorry?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Last one. Yeah, and then select the dropdown again and you can decide for how long you want to be away. So select fourth, November fourth or fifth, whichever you want to fourth since we're on the fourth, click on it and then select say, maybe you want to take some time to say 11 30 a. M. So click on 11 and 30. There you go. And now you can decide whether you want to unassign conversation. If a new reply is received while you're away. If you keep it unchecked, then you will continue to receive the same conversations, you to stay assigned in your name even if you're not available for some time.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  OK. All right.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  And just, can you save it for me for now? We will make you available again. Don't worry.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Sure. I mean, nothing's auto assigning to me anyway. So that's OK.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  OK. So there you go. As you can see, it's showing as away. Now, could you open one of the emails in your hiver mailbox, please? Any email and you're part of all of the mailboxes. So it won't matter.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  OK.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Now, on the right hand side, the… hiver is closed here. So you need to click, yes. OK. I don't have to tell, you know, everything.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I've been trying to get myself as familiar as possible with this. No, that's fantastic.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So, if you on the right hand side, scroll a little bit on the bottom, yeah, add a note, click here and select. Act. Yeah. Now, you see Jenn is unavailable. Everybody else, if you scroll down, you will notice that everyone else is currently available. This is what I was telling you that you can, you know… you can, in fact, then if, you know, it's an urgent query or something like that, you can go ahead and notify now. How this becomes also further helpful is let's say you have created an email, you have written the draft and are you aware of the shared draft functionality?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  No,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  OK.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  That's amazing. I love it even before you finish anything else. OK?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I'm glad you can just click on the blank space here.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yeah, it didn't go away. OK.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Just select Jenn and cancel. No, no, no, it won't go that way. Just cancel this. Yeah, there we go. OK. Now, what we'll do is we will reply to this email.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh, like regular reply. Oh, and then with this.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  No, no, no, just reply, normal reply or reply. All, it doesn't really matter. Scroll down. OK. Just scroll down. We just want to, you know, go ahead and remove the two because accidentally, we don't want to send an email to someone.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  yeah, good call. Yeah, just remove the two. So, yeah, fantastic. Now, in the… body of the email, this portion, the body, OK. Just type in, you know, whatever you want to type in, just go ahead and keep drafting.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  OK, fantastic. Now, you see this option right here? Share draft. Yeah… click on share draft.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  OK. Share draft has created?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  No, drop. This card. It just shows undo. Could you share draft?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Share draft? I clicked share draft? Hold on.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  OK. Oh, click. No. I think what's happening is the draft is already shared, just, we can discard this one.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yeah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  And could you scroll down… and let's see if your drop there you go. OK, this is the share draft. Now, this is a share draft where you can see last edited by Jenn at what time, you can see it was created by Jenn by whom, at what time all of these details show up. Now, what you can do, the way I personally use this is go to the notes and write at and say, for example, a user wants their supervisor to sign off on something or a new employee wants someone, you know, who is an existing employee to just say, hey, could you check on this? So select somebody who would probably be aware of this and then say, you know, please take a look and anything, you know, whatever you think would be the internal communication, right? And once.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  You've gone ahead and done that. And if you click on done then?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Amanda?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Will receive a notification out here, that will bring her directly to the share draft.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  So, here it will be.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, do you see Amanda mentioned, you, do you see the first one? Yeah, Amanda mentioned you in a note. So in her case, it will be Jenn mentioned you in a note.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Nice. Okay. And then, so, the way that this is… you can go ahead? I want, can I click on and then, yes, yes.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Click on it. No, no click. Click on, don't. Do that. Click on the first option, which?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  One here, Amanda?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Mentioned. Yeah, just click on it and wait for a moment. Let's help, wait for it to load. Yeah.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I already responded back to this. Okay?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  All right. So, in that case, could you click on the bell icon? Once you have responded, it should not stay in your notification. So let's see why it's still staying, yeah.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  So I said, okay, this is and then I said.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So, regardless of the action that you take, regardless of the action that you take once you click on the notification, we can set up such that, you no longer have to see that notification again. So could you click on the setting for me, please? Okay?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  And.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  scroll all the way to the bottom. I think we are not able to see display counts for at the very bottom. I'm not able. Yeah.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Hold on a second. I wonder if it's yes, I don't know why it's not showing everything but, okay, no.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Worries at all. Now, how… do you want to get notified? So I have personally, what I have done is whenever there's any direct mention, whenever there's an assignment, that is, I have been assigned a particular email, SLA, violations, if it's a response or resolution violation. So I have gone ahead and enabled these for myself. Now, for each person, it's you know, it really depends on what would be useful for you. So.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Okay.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  That, what I've done is I personally keep the second one which is keep the account for new priority notifications on that's how I do it.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Okay. So what.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  happens is if you, sorry… if you click, right?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  So,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  what happens is now, the other thing that we got to do is we have to check this box. So what happens now is that whenever you click on any of the notifications, it will take you to that email, but you will not see that notification in this notification box anymore. Is that what you want or do you want to? Yes, older? Okay?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  No, I don't want to see anything older. I think that's great. And I don't even know if I realized this was here until yesterday. So here we go. All these things we were doing. Yeah, I was testing all of these different notes that's great. Okay, excellent. So I can clean those notifications up, but that's also something that I want to make sure that I train my team on because I don't think that they are going to be like keeping an eye out for that.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  As part of my responsibility, I also provide training. So let me know if you want me to train your team.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yes. Okay. I do. I think it would be great. I mean, I'm all for training. I have a training background I under like, I think that it's extremely important to make sure that everyone has their, you know, their basis and their foundation so that we can get things going. So, I love that idea. All right?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. As a matter of fact, I come from an lnd background myself. Yeah. So I was in fact part of Adobe Adobe's lnd side, captivate, crime the E learning side. So I was part of that team that's.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  fantastic. Yeah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I, maybe I feel a little too strongly about enablement but I think it's really important. I.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Agree… wholeheartedly okay.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So now I would ask you to go to the very top, right? That you see, I have annotated and you click on the admin panel. Okay? And what I would love to see would be, and I'm sure you would also want to.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yeah. So one thing first, I want to make sure and this may be a Ron question, but I think right now I'm set up as a mailbox admin, and I probably need to be as a, an account admin, but we'll have that for.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  you right away, that's not a problem at all. But I'm seeing something that's… I do not… see your user details here.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  This is.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  the AI trial, this is nothing. So don't worry about that. Let me just see if there were any changes in the look and feel here. So just bear with me a second. Because why am I not seeing your settings and your user roles, that should not be the case.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Let's see my settings. It looks like this is separate, no.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  No, not my settings, but, okay, settings. Yeah. Dear lord. What's going on here? Just bear with me one second. I'm just going to look at my account. It looks like my demo account has been suspended. No.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  That.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  is so weird. Gosh… that's odd all.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Right. Let's see.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  We should find it. But so typically, I'll tell you what here in this section, you would have users and you would have your main settings and that is.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I would bet that's because my settings right now are because I'm a mailbox admin, not an account admin. Let.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Me go ahead and make that change then for you? I'm.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  making, I would, I'm just guessing but that would be what I'm assuming is happening, let,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  me, do that. Could you refresh? Could you refresh for me please?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  And then we need to go, no?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  No, no, no, not there. Not there. Below that. Yes, yes. Did you click? Sorry?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Can you see this little video of us? Like the little thing it gets in my way?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Try to get it. You can, you can close that… you, I can't see it, but I understand what you're saying. So you can click on hide thumbnail video that's the one on the extreme left. Got.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  It. Okay. Thank you. That's why I was trying to click to it, but it was blocked. No.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Worries at all. And you are now an admin? Okay?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  So, yeah, this is.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  This is what I was concerned about. I'm like why am I not seeing users and settings? Like, so, yeah, apologies, I should have figured that out. Could you click on settings please? Sure. Okay. So all the details are there? Fantastic. Now, what we are going to do is we will look at features access, which is fourth from the bottom. Okay. All right. So now, this is entirely flexible… and your decision and discretion, how you want to use these features. The first one says out of office. Now, you have, of course, enabled also by the way you are still away. So if you want to make yourself available, you could just do that. Sorry, I just noticed.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  That's okay. Here. She already, no, no.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  No, no.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  No.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  You need to mark on only unread if you click on the bell icon, click only unread there.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  We go. Okay.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So here, now, as the admin, you can decide whether when somebody marks themselves out of office every single time, whether the conversation must be unassigned, if a new reply is received, or every single time the conversation must be kept assigned to the individual. If a new reply is received, or do you want to give your agents as in your users the flexibility to control what happens. So they decide, okay, I want to continue this to be assigned to me. I don't want this assigned to me. So that is up to you how you want to go ahead with it. So.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  If this basically… right now the way that we have it set up and I can maybe I'll walk through what we have set up now and then you can explain if that, if what we have, how we have it set works for that or makes sense? Basically, we've created automations for all of the incoming inbox emails to come in and be assigned to the main customer experience lead for that account. Unless it's one of it falls into the no action needed and that's closed and put away. Basically, you know, out of sight. So anytime someone that is the main cxl… for that account is on out is out of office, what we wanted was and let me see if I can, no.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Just just tell me what your what? What? Yeah, I'm.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  trying to, I'm trying to think about how to explain it. So what we wanted was for… I have to use a real example. So say sue is going to be out of office today. All of the order, all of the emails that are coming into sue's account would typically fall under. They would be come in and be auto assigned to her. If we leave it where, when she's out of office, those things are still assigned to her. Then when someone is covering her, how do we know, how did that? How does that person know what actually needs to be handled versus, or that there is something to be handled? Because right now we have it where it no longer is assigned to sue, it goes into the unassigned box. And then when we have someone covering, they can look and say there's unassigned emails in that inbox. I need to go handle them. So… what?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Do you want it not to be unassigned? Or to be unassigned?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Well, I like the idea of it being unassigned so that it is an easily… for… new conversations. I want it to come in as and be unassigned. So that someone who's covering can visually see there's inbox or there's emails in that unassigned inbox, we have to go handle them.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I do have to tell you here though, it's not going to be the first email necessarily as it says here. If a new customer reply is received, so it could be the first email is in first reply or the second reply or, you know, whichever it is. So, okay, if you select the first one, yeah, if you select the first one, in that case, if sue is out of office today, and when you say out of office, it must be on hiver, out of office, right? Not the Google, the typical we set up the out of office, right? So, not that, but she has to mark herself as out of office, just on this icon on the left of the notification that's all she needs to do, then unassign the conversation. If a new customer reply is received, there's also an automation that you can do as an admin, which is you are aware of, you know, the date when somebody is going to be unavailable. In that case, you can decide that if an email is received, say between say, you know, tenth of November to twentieth of November, then assign it to X. Now, all the other people except this individual. That can also be done. Okay?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yeah. We, that was how we had originally set things up where it's almost like a round Robin… that auto assignment. So, we didn't use the auto assignment. We first, we set it up with the auto assignment and then we backed that off and set up automations to assign it to the lead. And that was by a recommendation of one, of the reps the hiver reps that we spoke with because it's typically like here. Let me, I, and I just have to show you like so I can use real examples and we can come back to this. So… for example, if… crystal is assigned on, she has the Boyd group and she has these, she's here today, normally working whatever. So say she's unavailable. Wren will always continue to have her emails assigned to her because she's working on it in a different manner. But when crystal's out of the office, then Carrie is the one who's going to step in and cover for Boyd group. But… I don't want to lock it in automatic like where it doesn't assign, leave it unassigned. It just assigns it to Carrie because there's… also the case that we could have Jessica or Natalie as… cover… as backup coverage in the event that Carrie can't or it doesn't make sense that day. So like we can't just reassign it someone else. But if we come in here and like I know that say, I know crystal's out today, I want anything new that comes in to fall into this box. Okay?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. In that case, the out of office, the first option that we saw works perfectly. Okay?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  So the, this one?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yes. So it will unassign. Okay. And one more thing that I want to show you is, you know, I would love to go through each one of these, but since we're on the topic, there's one more thing that I would love to show you, which is if you click on the shared inboxes here, please this?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Right here. No, thank you.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Select any shared inbox… and you can click on automations.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Fantastic. You know what? Let me use a different one because I think I know what you're showing but I want to make sure that it makes sense. Okay? So.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Right now, you don't okay. Could you show me the automations you have? Please? If you don't mind, yeah, the conversation is.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  receiving right here. Let's do one at a time. So first, so,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  any new conversation comes into this mailbox, it is assigned to sue regardless of who is sending the email.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Correct. Okay. And then second.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  One says.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  And then the next one, this is the stock emails that come in that we don't that we know do not need action, no.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Action needed change, that is fantastic. Okay.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  And then this is if someone, if a customer or someone, if one of we, if one of us does it or the customer replies or whatnot, we send an email, I think this is mailbox reply. So I don't know if it has to come from us internally. But ultimately, if someone emails based on these stock emails, so like responds to one of those stock emails, then it will open. And this says ads tag waiting on customer response. So I don't know who made this thing, but… ideally, that's this is what Ren does. So Ren is in here. She's going to go in and respond and say, hey, I, your respond to the order confirmation email and say, I need a different address. There's that we've received an error or there's something going on with your order. We need an update and then it will open and it will automatically… tag waiting for customer response. The only other thing that I'm.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Jen, sorry. So sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. I'm so sorry that's okay. One thing that I have seen as a best practice in, you know, with teams who are client facing is if you're waiting on a customer response instead of changing status to open, change it to pending. So then, you know, that it's just a recommendation. It doesn't no, it.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Makes great sense. I didn't make this, yes. Yeah, click.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  On open, yeah, pending. So what happens here is open means a new email has come and no one has looked at it. Nothing has happened to it. It's open pending means some work is happening, but right now it's pending on the other side, open would mean it's open at your end?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yep. I love it. Nope. That makes perfect sense. And that's what this was intended for. So that's why I changed it so quickly as soon as I understood what you were saying. I was like, yep, that's what we need. Okay? Fantastic.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  And that way, what you can also do is when you're filtering by status, so you can filter by open pending, close, etc. So if all of these where you're waiting on customer is on pending, then the moment you click on filter, it will filter out only all of those emails. Otherwise all the open emails will open up. Okay? If that makes sense at all?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Okay. It does. No, that makes really good sense. Okay, cool. So, okay, we.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  will probably have to change it for all of the mailboxes.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yep, we will. Okay. And then I don't know, I just off the top of my head, I looked at the clock and realized I don't remember how long this meeting is scheduled to go? Yeah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I was about to in fact ask you the exact same thing. I do have a call like not right now, 30 minutes from now, 35 minutes to precise. So I can give you another maybe 10, 15 minutes more, but I do have to jump off and prepare for that call. No.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I think that, I mean, if we can wrap it up and then we'll be, we'll schedule another call. I think we'll be good. Wait, I just did that one. So, yeah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  One thing that I would want to show you in an automation these we can, do, you know, you can do it. I'm sure, you know, you'd be able to do it on your own. One thing I wanted to in fact show you since we were on the topic is click on create automation please?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Okay. And.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  This couple of things that I would want to focus on and I think again being in a client facing role, these are automations that will be useful for you. So let's say if you click on the drop down, which says new conversation. Yeah. So let's say a new inbound conversation is received. This is by the way, the correct one. So I just wanted you to take a look at the ones. So, okay, click outside or even this one? Yeah, it doesn't matter add step. Yeah, click on add step. If the first one, if condition, if now select condition. Now, what happens is let's say time passed since… yeah, sorry, time passes and then click on no external reply. The second option. Yeah… the second drop down now, let's say there has been no external reply received or no change in status or no assignee? No change in tag. Nothing happened. Okay?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Right.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  In that case, you can go ahead and add an automation to send a notification to someone. You can nudge someone and say that, hey, this needs to be worked on.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I love this. This is exactly what we needed. This is one of the one, this is amazing. Okay. We need this, I'm.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  glad this is one, the other thing is if you click on the time pass since again, please, so we can see below that, do you see the, so I'm going to assume here, Jen, that you guys work Monday to Friday or do you also work weekends? No?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Just Monday to Friday?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. Then click on the day below date you'll see day… and is any of the option right there? Yeah, click there.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  What's happening?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Add, hold on day?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Click on the, oh, okay. Is any of that's fine? The drop down? Sorry, I thought you were clicking on the, yeah, Saturday Sunday? No, no, no, just click on Saturday, Sunday. Okay. Click outside. Fantastic. Now, add step below that add step, scroll down action.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  My goodness. My clicker isn't clicking. Okay?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then click on. Okay… scroll down. Yeah, no, no, stop, send a reply. What happens is in that case because you're in a client facing role, you can go ahead and send an automated reply like, hey, we've received your email. Thank you so much. We will get back to you as soon as possible.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh, nice. Yes. Oh, oh my gosh. So that means… wait a minute. Oh my God. Okay. Hold on. I'm so excited right now because one of the things that my boss has been asking for, I don't even know how long months years, probably years was to set up a total like to create automated replies for when mercury is closed on days that other businesses may not necessarily be closed.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Okay. So we can set up like our holiday schedule and have automatic replies, 100 percent like out of office, basically like an out of office message.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  100 percent, you can do that. And the best part is, if you click on the two drop downs at the top, you can send it from assignee or from the mailbox, so you can send it from void's ad, or you can send it from Jenn. Whosoever,

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I love it. This is amazing. This is, oh, I'm going to hang up this call and call my boss right now and be like this, is it, we did it, it's here.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I'm glad I'm so glad. Oh, my gosh. And the best part is you can personalize it. So in the body, yeah, you can send it to only the contacts or to all people who sent it and just type in, maybe, yeah, so you can send it to all participants as well. Type, hi and… space.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  And hi.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Give it a space, oh, to.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Put in the name. Oh, yes. I love it. Okay. And.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  You can select contact name… and it will pick it up from the email that you have received.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh my gosh. Yep, this is great. Thank you.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I'm glad.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I'm going to have so much fun building this.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I'm so happy to hear that, you know, this is the thing like hiver, the kind of tool it is, of course, it's very useful, but also, it's a lot of fun to play around with. There's a lot of gamification involved as well. So, it's fun. I personally enjoy it.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh, my goodness. Okay. So, all right. So, I will, I'm going to, I'm going to stop this now, but come back to it because.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  we don't want to do it right now, but, okay, anything else that we?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  There's a lot more that I would love to show you, but we don't have the time today, right? I would love to set up another call. When would you recommend? It would be a good time?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yeah. Oh, hold on a second. Okay. So we're in luck because I have every other week is either really busy in meetings or not. And this is a week where it's not really busy in meetings. So that's amazing.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. I have.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  To.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  change you on the chat, my scheduler, could you open that please? Which time zone are you based in? Oh, fantastic. I work eastern as well.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Okay. Excellent.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Mostly eastern a.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Little,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  bit of overlap happens with european time as well. Okay?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  And then where are you located in Europe?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I am currently in India.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh, wonderful.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yes, I came home and promptly fell sick and I just never left.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Oh my gosh. Well, I love that.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  That makes me happy that you're home and that you have people around you that can care for you. Hopefully. Okay. So I will look at your scheduler and then, and find… a time. So, should we schedule an hour?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yes. Well, I was thinking Jenn is typically, you know, this is not going to be a typical onboarding because, you know, your account is set up and so on what we would do is set up more mailboxes for you, add users to those mailboxes, but I'm not sure if that would be the best use of our time together considering you've already, you know, you're already aware of how to do all of that, right? So I was thinking.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Okay.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I was thinking why not? We look at the things that hiver can do for you. So, things like maybe, you know, custom object. Sorry. Oh my God, I just ran out of the word. Oh.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Custom fields. Yes.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Custom fields, some of the AI functionalities, if you're looking at which, of course, right now you have on a trial basis, if that's something you want to play around with, we can see that more automations, you know, just look at the.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I'm curious as to why we have a trial basis of the AI thing. I think, I thought that it was included in the contract.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I will have to look at that.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Yeah, I.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  haven't had a chance to look at your contract. I'm so sorry that's.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  okay. It's been one day. How dare you just kidding? Okay, hold on.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Let me make.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Sure that scheduler stayed open. Hold on. Okay. So, oh, all right. So if we do an hour?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yes. You do in fact have AI as part of the contract. I'm so sorry that's okay. No.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Apology needed. I just wanted to make sure I had it that I didn't somebody didn't like change it on me on our end. Okay? So it looks like tomorrow, you pretty much are not available other than very like before our working hours. So Thursday, I can probably grab some of your time. And then, how often, how many meetings, what is the cadence? What does this look like? Is it a weekly thing?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  What I would love to do is on Thursday, let's look at the features that you'd find useful. Now, I have a basic understanding of your use case. So let's from my, at my end, I will make a list of the features that I think would be useful for you, and we will put those together once we have a chance to look at those features, enable as many as required and so on including the AI. Of course, then we will decide what would be the next call. Typically, I would like to do a training call. So one call, it could be two calls, you know, if all of your users are available at the same time. Awesome. If not, we can have more than one call. So, okay. And then what I like to do is connect with my clients on hiver. Again, this depends on your schedule. You know, it's a mutually decided upon thing. So either on a monthly or once in two months basis or however now that you've just started using hiver, I would want to keep it on a slightly more regular basis.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So at least once a month. But if you want to reach out before that, you know, feel free to. So I'm more than happy to connect. Yeah.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Excellent. So, and… this normally like shows up in just in working together a little bit. But so I have definitely a little bit more tech savvy, whatever I hate that expression. But like I understand technology quickly, I pick up on it quickly. What I would like to do is like get our, all, the rest of our accounts kind of set up with the basics like we have that we did on the trial. And then, so if we go over the features on Thursday and then we schedule a training for next week?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Does that do, does that, will that work for you? If we do that timing wise? Could we do a training next week that should?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Be perfectly fine. I think next week, we do have one holiday veterans day that's on the eleventh. Okay. My Thursday is once again, very free. So.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Okay. So we can look at, yeah. All right. I will look at your calendar and our scheduler and find some time that works for our team. So get the, this Thursday booked for you and I, and then next week for training and I'll, for the training, how long do you need?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  If it's going to be interactive, which I personally prefer. It usually takes about an hour. If I have to do a bit of a monologue and poke and prod for questions, then about 45 minutes.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Okay. All right. So hopefully this will be interactive. I think, you know, our folks are pretty responsive I guess on a call like that. So if you, if and, I can do the poking and prodding if necessary. But most, I think that there'll be good questions for those involved. And then, so… we'll book for an hour. I will have to determine with my team whether or not we can do everybody at once or if we have to do two separate team meetings or two trainings.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. Yeah, I'm happy to do either, whatever works for you.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I will get those, I'll find some time on your schedule and get that booked.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. All right. Thank you so much for your time. Jenn. Appreciate it. And I'm really sorry we overran by almost 10 minutes there, but I hope you found it productive. I surely did because I learned about how you want to use hiver. So on the next call, I'll be better prepared and connect on this.

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  I am very pleased. I'm excited to get rolling. So thank you so much.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. Thank you so much for your time. Speak to you on Thursday. Take care now. All right?

Jenn Niederoest (niederoestj@mercuryfs.com):
  Bye bye.
