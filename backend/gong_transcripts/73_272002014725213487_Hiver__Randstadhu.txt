Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  maybe I'll die.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Hi, Beata. Good afternoon. How are you doing?

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Yeah, I'm fine. Good afternoon to all.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Thanks for joining in and thanks for being flexible, you know, with the change in timing, really appreciate that. So on the call, I have Raghav who's the account manager for randstand. Who's also, you know, working with the randstand us team, you've met him in the past. Yes. And the main agenda of today's call, you know, as we discussed last time was to go over the pricing given the fact that your team is exceeding the automations for the… we can do for your team in order to, you know, get you on the elite plan so that you can continue using the automations. And as I mentioned, last time, you know, also talk about also help your team use the custom fields that will let, you know, just have one single excel sheet to create data from different, for different taggings and automations, right? Especially for the email addresses for the different members that are working for, these organizations with the help of which we can go ahead and automatically add the tag and making it super easier for your team, to manage the way emails are tagged. Yeah?

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Yep. I do get it. Yes.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So, I'm going to hand it over to Raghav. Now, we're just going to try and understand where we can, you know, help you in terms of the commercials and see what best we can do from both parties. That will, that will, you know, help you continue with the way things are especially from an automation standpoint.

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hope everything's going well. It's been a while.

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Yeah, yeah, thank you. I'm fine.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Brilliant. So we are heading into the conversation, right? I wanted to, you know, in terms of the commercials purely as it stands, right? I'd still want to check with you in terms of the consolidation angle because we tried that last time and you know, what we heard was that your business unit wants to keep the billing separate. The reason why I ask is because last week, the central randstad team reached out to kick off the renewal process. And so I just wanted to check if that's something you'd maybe want to run with your leadership again or, you know, we're still going to be working on two separate deals.

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Yeah. I think we're still going to work on two separate bills because we have, we do not have the resources to upgrade to the elite plan. Actually, we are helpful that we can still have the pro plan to be really like honest with you. So I don't think that it could be like really put forward to management or higher decision makers to upgrade to a higher plan because we just do not have the budget for it. So even the fact that we still use hiver and we still can have hiver for all of the team members, it's a big thing for us. So I wouldn't want to push or lock so to speak to push for the elite plan which would be most likely rejected.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Now. That makes sense. But on a realistic sense as well in terms of the number of automations, if commercials aren't viable from an everyday workflow perspective, do you see all of these automations being useful in terms of the sheer number of it?

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Well, to be honest with you, the majority of these automations help me personally to make my life a little bit easier, but they are like not business crucial elements of everyday work. Yeah, we can reduce the number and to be really honest and I know that it's not really the aim of this meeting because the aim is to find a common ground so to speak, but to upgrade to the elite plan. That's not something that we can do. What we can do is we can reduce the number of automations that we use. There are a few automations that are business critical. I would say, I mean process critical at least, so we would like to keep them. I honestly… I do not know as of yet how many are really like business critical that we have to keep. But the majority of them are just actually for my pleasure, so to speak, or for my comfort, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, makes sense. Beata. So I mean, there's one of two ways in which we can go about it, right? And looking at the way in terms of budget that you put forth is why I went back to the automation contract. So two things, right? Considering your relationship with hiver for as long as you've been with us, right? It's more than like three years at this point. So what I can do is I can work with leadership to have a one time discount unlocked that will be valid till renewal. And at renewal, we'll be looking at a little more closer to the list prices and what that would look like, right? And this is primarily because, you know, we're having this discussion mid cycle and I understand how budgets work at organizations like yours. So what I can do is we don't want to put you on the spot and have you go to list price. But at the same time, if you do feel both from a personal and from a business critical perspective, if you need more than 20 automations, then realistically, only the elite plan can support that. And what I can do is after this call, I can just a discount percentage that would be a reasonable price increase if you want to retain more than 20 rules. Unfortunately, we can't continue keeping you flat at 49 till renewal. But what I can promise you is I can work with leadership to unlocking a discount that will bring the dollar amount closer to 50 55 in that range. Basically, I'll try to keep your cost increase under 20 percent, right? That's about like an eight to nine dollar increase from what you're paying right now. And compared to 75, that's going to be about a 15 dollar decrease, right? 10, 15 dollar discount each.

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Because the elite plan would be 75 dollars per user per month, that's the normal.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Price. And.

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  currently, we are on 49. Yeah, that's a lot.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Exactly. So what I can do as just looking at the relationship and the partnership we've had, I can work with my team to keep the increase as close to an agreeable price point as possible. But at the same time, I do want to set the clear expectation in that it's definitely going to be at least 10 percent more at the, very bare minimum, right? And that's only because your user count on hiver as a hungry business unit is about like 11 people total, right? Yep. So, you know, usually at 25 30 people is when I'm able to unlock more than 20 percent discount on list prices. But considering the relationship, I'll still have a discussion with my team and see if I can have the same 20 percent discount on 75 or maybe a little more than that unlocked for your team. So from an expectation perspective, you're looking at a price increase of anywhere between 10 to 12 dollars, give or take per person per month. And this would hold true till renewal in may 20 26. In may 20 26. We can look at your usage, all the extra features you get. And, you know, we can look at pricing at that point based on, you know, if the user count increases, your headcount grows things like that. There's going to be more room for us to have that discussion, okay?

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Obviously, I'm not going to be the decision maker in this. So if you could put this in writing then I can forward this to the it manager and those who are in charge of budget in this term, but, you know, it's not likely that we would agree to. I mean, if we decrease the number of automations to 20, then we can use the pro plan as we have done in the past without any changes as for now, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's true. So if you're at 20 or lesser than that, you don't need any cost increase on your subscription rate, it continues at 49. Okay? And, you know, we can effectively go at the lead plan. So what I'll do, like I said, right? Let me just work up the code. What I wanted to check with you was the appetite for the increase, you know, just to have that clarity from you saying if a price increase would even be viable because, you know, I want to make sure that you still get to do the best out of hiver, just like Leander, right? So I was trying to find that middle ground with you. So, thanks for giving me the clarity on expectations. Yes, I'll still work with. Yeah, I'll still work with leadership, get the best discount, possible, send it over in an auto form, right? Okay. And, you know, if you'd like to take that route, we'd effectively be looking at a confirmation before the 26, 27 to November that's pretty much what I'd be tying the date for the discount, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. And yeah, you can keep us posted on email if required. We can hop on another call later in the month. Okay? Good.

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  I say that we give it a try because really, I do not truly see the willingness to change to elite even with a discount to be really honest with you, but let's give it a try because I'm not really the one to make the shots here.

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  I'm not responsible for budget. I'm mainly just your point of contact for mainly technical stuff, but obviously that reaches out to other terrains as well. So let's try and we will see how we can come out of this.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. It's great to hear from you. Thank you so much for your willingness to give this a shot. I'll send over all the auto form basically before tomorrow, you can use that, have that discussion and, you know, we'll stay in touch. Just drop me a line if you need any additional. Okay?

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Thank you. That sounds amazing. Thank you. Cheers.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. That's it for me. Beata, back to you, Leanne?

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Okay.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, thanks. Thanks for that, Raghav. Thanks for being flexible with the pricing. So, Beata, also, thank you for taking the time and trying to get this, you know, looked by your leadership and the decision maker. What I would like to do is just meet with you maybe on the 20 sixth to discuss how we can proceed with this and whatever the next steps should be.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  So, do you have time at around this? Like let's say two o'clock cet on the 20 sixth of Wednesday, I can put up a 15 minute call if that's okay?

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Yeah, that looks okay. Yes.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Perfect. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to drop us an email. We'll be happy to get back to you on that. Okay?

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Okay. Thank you. All all right.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Thank you. Thanks. Beata, have a wonderful day ahead.

Beáta Takács (beata.takacs@randstad.hu):
  Thank you. Bye bye.
