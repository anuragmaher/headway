Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  hi Ellen. Can you hear me okay?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Yeah, you're coming through?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Good morning. How are you doing today?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Good. How are you?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Really good. Thanks for asking. I did want to jump on to make sure that we give you the best experience you need. I'm not sure whether you got my email that I just sent?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  No, I didn't did you need to reschedule? No?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No, not reschedule, but I wanted to let you know which is good. I'm glad that we jumped on. Anyway, wanted to set some context. Visiting angels has been. I'm not sure whether, you know this already, but we've got such a long relationship with visiting angels all within hiver, a lot of their teams. I think, yes, a couple of franchises and I think the main office as well have all been using hiver for many years now.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Yeah, matt thompson out of beaver dam, wherever he said that he, he's the one who recommended me and he did tell me to drop his name when I talked to you guys. So fantastic. Yeah. So it does sound like you guys do. And I'm just, it sounds like I'm just curious to understand a little bit more how your system works and to see how it works like for our organization. So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. I'm happy to do that just to just full disclosure just to give you some context. So you've reached the sales team which takes care of any net, new business, net, new accounts, right? However, since that you already have visiting angels is such a valued partner and we've been working together for so many years. We've got a dedicated team that is meant just to work with visiting angels. So that's who I looped in on email, but that's completely fine since you're here, I'm going to make sure that you get some, we give you some context. And then if we need to grab some more time, we can.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Okay, perfect. Yeah, just a little bit of context would be great. And then I definitely will, it usually takes me a couple calls anyways to understand what's going on so you can give me the just like the generic one down. And then I'll do my next call with the visiting angels team with.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Your, with your dedicated success call. And the reason only reason why we also recommend that is because like, what that ends up happening is, you know, it ends up, they have a lot of context on exactly how the visiting angels teams, the different teams are using hiver already. So, yeah, so definitely want to dive into that. But in terms of context, I'll set some, I'll set a little bit of a little bit of context and go through what we typically do. And so what hiver is we are a layer on top of your inbox, right? That it wants to give you and your team the tools they need to work together on any shared modes of communication. Okay? And what I mean by that is for example, if you've got like a shared email where there's a lot of a lot of traffic coming in and you are, you have a team of people that are responsible for responding to that traffic, whether it's via email, whether it's via some other form of communication, via chat, via whatever else. It could be. What hiver is, wants to do is give you a layer that just like sort of wraps around this communication stream with your clients or anyone external and gives your team the tools they need to make life very easy on their end, managing this team of communication. And for you who is sort of the head of the franchise and head of the department, you give you the ability to really gauge how your team is doing, build workflows, make their life easier. And then of course, in this day and age, leverage AI as best as you can, right? So those are the three aspects. Let me give you some. Let me just share my screen and run through it. But before I do that, I know the rest of the visiting angels teams they use Google.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  We use Microsoft. Yeah. Got.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It. Great. So because we do have a little,

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  different, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's fine. And, we love that because we actually have both products… granted that the rest of the entire, all the users on hiver are on the Google product which is literally built into a Gmail window. Whereas we also have a… Microsoft product that I've just shared screen right now, which is our own web application. You come into this web application, you log in using, your standard Microsoft email address, right? And once you're logged in here, you can use this web application to really streamline all these modes of communication that I spoke about. But that starts with your personal inbox. So of course, this could technically be a replacement for outlook where you can come in here and actually use your and access your personal inbox here as well. Some of our customers prefer some of our customers don't they still want to use outlook and only come in here to manage their shared emails. So for example, I've got five shared mailboxes here on the left support sales and success, healthcare HR and finance. Each of these folders are what we call shared inboxes. Each of these folders involve. I have a lot of emails in there. So whenever an email comes into maybe my support team, I am able to access that email. I am able to read all the back and forth and I have this side panel that helps me assign things, categorize things and essentially work together as a team. So instead of people, the emails being stuck in individual accounts or they all just going in. And just like it's a free for all, this is adding a layer of structure and sort of like an organization on top.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Got it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Questions, concerns not concerns, questions and anything that you want to sort of specifically dive into?

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  No, that makes so I, so inbox gets so outlook inbox gets poured into this. Yes, can, does hiver also connect with other like with text platform? We specifically use apple, we use, we have like a shared apple account that we have one phone and we have all of our ipads connected to. Do you guys integrate with that?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We, at the moment, we do not, we are looking at sort of releasing. So right now, we've got everything covered on from an email perspective, but we are looking to sort of like branch out into texting and phone and chat. And that as well as we've already got our version of our sales chat here where it literally, you can like host a chat on your website and have that flow in here as well. But yeah, definitely.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Yeah. And I don't know, I'm just kind of getting into this and understanding where we're getting big enough where things are getting dropped and missed because there's 10 people trying to manage everything and it is not good. So, yeah, just trying to understand, you know, what avenues we can go in from. So, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So a, great screen to just look at and for you to get a sense of like long story short, what does hiver do to me do to my team on a day to day basis? Is this screen right here? So what we, this is our team section, right? So what this section gives you is it gives you a list of all the current ongoing conversation that your teams are handling, right? So, these are eight conversations that my team is handling right now. The name of who is handling them is right here, right? So if I come in here, I can see that this one's with Yukta, this one's with me. These two are with Rakesh. So I can see all of that here. And this last one's with Jenny who's another member of our team. You can also see here that each person has their own folder. So, for example, I know that Cole has nothing. I've got one, Jenny's got one. Rakesh has got four. So I click on Rakesh's game. He's actually on a day off today, right? So if I were to reply, open this email, I can see all the back and forth that has been exchanged on that thread. I don't need to be cc'd I don't need to be forwarded this email. I can see everything that Rakesh has done when he's on a day off. I don't have to worry him. I don't have to bother him for context or anything I open. I have all the contacts in front of me and then you can come in and you can take over for Rakesh cover for Rakesh and if he comes back in, he can see what he's what you've done during his time off. So he doesn't have to worry about being brought back to speed.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Okay. And how do you, so you look at the shared inbox and you assign it to people I'm guessing like the manager assigns?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Great question. So you can either manually assign, right? Which is literally going into the assignee section, hitting a drop down and literally picking someone off this drop down. This is one part of it. However, as you can imagine in this day and age, this is like maybe 20 percent. On average of all our customers do it manually, right? There is a ton of automations that you can set up on the back end. In terms of workflows. We have a workflow builder where you can build workflows that says these type of conversations should go to these people, so on and so forth.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Good. Okay. So, kind of automated there? Awesome. So, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So we actually prefer it. So, yeah, automations to assign emails to tag emails to set priority. All of that can be automated. You also have a literally, you can see like sort of like a internal workspace here where Rakesh is literally asking Cole for help and the timestamp and the date and timestamp of that is right here. I can also see all the previous activities on this email that I can see all of them right here. And here's the best part at the end of all of this, right? Let's say it's a very standard request that your team has got. So when it's a standard request, you have two options. One, you can use email templates, right? That you can share, create and share with the team and that gets picked up right here. And you can have that right here, right? I clicked it twice my mistake, but you can have that right here. These are standard templates that you can store and use. But let me take this one step further, right? We also have our AI co pilot which I think is the core of pretty much everything that we're offering right now. So what our co pilot does is it helps you answer questions really well for that. You can either ask it a question, saying, what is… hiver's? Onboarding plan? I'm hoping this is sort of captured here so that's going to literally going to be able to go in and you can train our AI by the way on the backend, you can literally upload documents, upload PDFS… upload stuff like this where it learns from it and using that you can choose and you can retrieve information quickly. So you can ask AI, right? So you can teach information. It also learns from other email conversations that your team is having. So if you answered a question in a certain way three times, it learns from it. And then you can do that. That's number one, right? And then number two is you can actually go in here and you can literally ask it to draft a reply. Now based on like I said things that you've taught it things that it's learned from. It will actually give you three very relevant, very contextual response options. So in this case, I'm going to say option two, and then in this case, it'll actually take all the context it already has and it's learned from and it'll create a draft for you and you can simply insert the draft, edit it and send it out.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Okay. Right. That's great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, the idea for us is to give your team the tools they need to organize to cut out all the manual effort and like really stay organized in their inbox and make sure nothing falls through the cracks. And then once they've done the organization, we use AI and our own logic to help you respond, better, respond quicker and respond accurately.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, great. Good, good. That makes sense. Well, I appreciate. Yeah, I definitely appreciate that overview just to orient me with the product at all. So I definitely needed that to understand. And then, yeah, I would definitely like to go the next step and talk to was her name Shoni? Sonali? Yeah, talk to Sonali and see how it works and with our company. So, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah. So I definitely, I've already given her a heads up, so you should be hearing from her shortly. She's got a lot more context. I actually was part of. I've been in the business for a while. I don't know. I joined in 2018. So I was actually part of the first ever really small team in visiting angels that came up maybe six years ago to ask about hiver. And since then, I think now we've like we've got well over 100 people, I think using hiver across different franchises, different locations, different departments. So it's been a great journey and we definitely want to see how they've been using it as well. And I'll let, I'll give Sonali a heads up to get in touch with her.

Ellen Kluck (ellen@visitingangelsswmi.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Thanks Sharan, I appreciate the time and I'm looking forward to talking to her. So, thank you so much.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Thanks. Have a good one. Bye bye.
