================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hello?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Hello. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm good, Desiree. How are you doing?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  I'm doing well. Thanks for meeting with me.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It's my pleasure. Thank you so much for showing interest in the AI capabilities on hiver, looks like you wanted to chat about the sentiment piece specifically.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Yes. So specifically the sentiment piece because we want to be able to track just, you know, communication between our clients and our employees and how that's going about.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  So, I'm just interested in like, you know, obviously the cost of the AI, you know, having that feature and the reporting aspect of it specifically, like how that all works. Yeah, and go ahead.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, no, definitely. So, Desiree, the first thing I wanted to understand, you know, is in terms of the commercial angle of it, the whole AI add on is priced as a full package suite. It's not an a la carte at this point, which means you would be getting the entire AI add on suite including the sentiments, right? And the whole thing is priced at a 20 dollar per user per month as an individual add on and it will be applicable for the entire subscription as well, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, from a commercial angle, that's what it looks like. But I do have leverage for a little bit of added incentives if that would help, you know, make the decision easier. But before I go down any kind of commercial discussions with you, I understand sentiments is your primary requirement. On the other hand, have you also checked out any of the other AI features and do you think they'll be helpful and useful?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  I have not actually, the sentiment piece was the one we just noticed because it started happening on the set and we're like, oh, this is cool. All right. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So let me do one thing, right? Let me, how about I give you like a quick 10 minute overview in terms of what this would look like, right? And, you know, you let me know if there's other elements of the AI that looks interesting. Obviously, I'll start with the sentiment piece, show you the reporting possibilities. There's also automations, you can kick off based on sentiments. So, I'll give you a quick example scenario on both of those. And then we'll talk a little bit about the other AI features as well. Yeah.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Awesome. Yeah, go ahead.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. Let me get my screen share up and running. Let me know when you can see my Gmail inbox. Yep. Brilliant. All right. So I'm going to use my support inbox because that's the one where I've got all my AI enabled as well. And you've already got the sentiments. Now, the first thing is obviously that the sentiment tracking that you see is not a one time thing, right? It doesn't just stop with the first email you receive. It is going to be an ongoing kind of tracker in the sense that if somebody starts out with a negative connotation, and during the course of the conversation, your team members are able to make them or convert them for lack of a better way of saying it into a positive experience. You're going to be able to track the entirety of it, right? So what that will look like is just give me a minute. Let me see if I have any examples where, you know, I've got some scenarios where it went from negative to positive or something along those lines. So if you notice, yeah, the one that says current is the most latest sentiment, you know, based on the latest reply and the original, there's going to be a line below this that says original would effectively indicate the place where they started from. So if somebody's you know, starting on a negative note and then they come back and, you know, make them all positive and happy, then that's what that entire transition would pretty much look like right now in terms of reporting, which is the one that you were interested in. The whole sentiments as AI driven are part of your standard reporting module here. And that's the report that I've just pulled out, right? We've got a dedicated space just for the sentiments. You can work it just like you would typically. And if you notice you've got quick filtering options as well. So you can go by sentiment track the email, go all the way down to that individual email thread like you would with any other reporting on hiver. And I think this might be a good example so that's effectively what that would look like. So from a reporting standpoint, you're going to be able to see subject in terms of overview, filter, by sentiment, track the subject, the email address of the client timestamp, and your hiver agent who is handling it.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Got it. And you can filter it out by like time period. So I see above there's like a little calendar. So it'd be like weekly monthly. Okay. Last time you? Perfect. Okay. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So that's the one you've got there. You've also got additional filters as well. So for instance, if you want to just look at a certain individual's sort of sentiment handling mechanism, you can definitely do that as well. So do that filter. And that shows you here for that one person, what's the negative, like what's the positive? Like what's the very positive and hold on. Okay?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Perfect. And.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  if this is more useful, yeah, sorry, go ahead. Okay.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  So when I was in there, I saw also that I could like tag myself. So let's say it's a negative interaction. Like there's methods to tag a certain person like for example, as a manager like tag myself to be able to review the conversation.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. You know, I think I might have just the right example for you right here. So what I've done is I've got like a mock scenario built out in a workflow effectively what my scenario does and you can do a same thing. If not even more is basically saying, hey, hiver, when you're clicking off a workflow, look for the sentiment as your first measure. And if the sentiment is negative or very negative, then you can have hiver in our scenario. It sends out a reply like this saying, hey, contact. Sorry to hear that your experience as hiver hasn't been ideal. Obviously the verbiage you can pretty much play with it. But the intention here is you're saying, hey, I noticed that you're not having the best of experiences that's not what we'd like to deliver. I'm the team leader. I'm the manager or I'm in charge of your case. Yeah, yeah, blah blah blah, feel free to write back to me directly and have that sent out. This would only go out to negative, very negative based on my workflow. Additionally, you can send out the reply, reassign it to somebody, add a certain tag, mark it under a certain priority. Now, this is a custom field that I've got that says priority. So you can do any number of things here. In addition, you can even be like, you don't want to send an email, you don't want to do anything but you want to add a tag that says negative urgent or something like that and let's say you want to drop a hybrid notification, just a bell alert that says, hey, there is somebody with a negative sentiment. You can do any and all of these things together.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Very cool. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, that way, negative sentiments and both positive sentiments as well can become more than just emojis on the hybrid platform basically.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Right. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Apart from that, there's also a piece called the AI extract. So, does your team work with a lot of like invoice numbers, things like that within the email you receive?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Not necessarily. We have a tax team and they get invoices that are for tax purposes, but they typically don't have like a, yeah, no, I would say no.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. All right. Then, in that case, I'll probably skip the AI extract piece of it. But if you do have any scenario where you've got an alphanumeric numbering mechanism or just a numeric numbering mechanism that you'd want to surface on the right panel on hybrid easily, then an AI extract could be used within your automation workflows. Again, just a quick example of what that would look like is you'll have a field on the right panel here that says, for instance, ticket summary or, you know, invoice id or something like that. In your case, tax id for example, and that could just be automatically filled by the AI based on what's in the email.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Right. Okay. Oh, nice. Okay. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So that can be auto populated again through an automation and AI together. The other elements of AI, obviously, the other major one when it comes to operational, everyday efficiency is auto tagging or AI tagging as we call it. So if you've got a lot of workflows that are automation driven on hiver, and if they're going to be adding categories that says, hey, if you've got the words urgent priority, important, business critical, whatever add the tag. Urgent issue. Now, for these kinds of cases where it's more probabilistic, which is it's about a certain scenario, but you're not always going to get 100 percent of those as keywords because people type it differently and go for it differently, those would be ideal candidates for AI tagging. The way you can set it up is basically just like with any AI system, you've got to train the AI model on the certain type of tag. And the kind of emails, it should apply to what you will need is basically select the tag and give the AI tag 10 examples of, hey, these are all the scenarios where my team classifies as a cancellation request. This could be new emails. This could be old emails. You can remove existing emails with the same tag and just re, add the tag as well. It's just for AI tagging training, please.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  So,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  once you've fed it 10 emails as examples, those then start being automatically tagged for every future scenario. And the AI in itself generates a default prompt as well which you can further refine and fine tune. So it pretty much covers the entire breadth of what that category means for you as a business and how you want to track it. Okay. Like in an example scenario, again, the billing is a very commonly used tag across industries. Typically, when you want to create an automation for it, you're going to try to fit in 20 30 keywords inside. And you still might have things that slip and fall through the cracks with AI tagging driving the billing tag. In my case, it's basically going to cover every inquiry that relates to financial transactions, charges, invoices or refunds associated. So if you notice it's more generic, which means now it's going to have a very wider net that it can cost to include and ensure the right emails are captured within the tag. And as the next step from here, automations can be used on the AI tags as well. So you can set up again workflows, assignments, reminders, email replies, status changes, whatever based on a tag being automatically added as well. So that could be another way you can go about the AI tagging itself. And the other main piece that we have that's released as of today is the AI copilot. And this is more of your conversational writing assistance for your team members. Now, the way it works is if you have a bunch of processes, a bunch of documents, information, things like that your team has to refer to when they're typing out a reply. What you can do is just feed these knowledge sources to the hiver copilot over here, under AI, these could be documents. These could be snippets of just email examples, replies, things like that. Or you could have it created as a full fledged knowledge base on hiver. We have them listed out as articles and you start leaving it in here. Now, this can be an internal knowledge base. So you don't technically need to host it on a website or worry about external parties seeing your internal process. So it can be internal purely. But with that said, once you've got either documents uploaded or the knowledge base created or maybe a combination of both this ask AI starts getting all the more useful for your team on a daily basis. Now here's how it works. I've got this email that says somebody asked me to review a renewal contract and sign it. If I'm an agent, I can just go here and be like, hey help me draft a reply. It's going to give me three scenarios. Let's say I want to give it scenario two, saying request contact clarification and propose a call. It's basically going to run through all of my uploaded knowledge sources, connected documents, everything like that. And it's then going to give me a full reply that I can either insert if it's ready or fine tune and be like we're fine for more professional talk. So it keeps going at it. And if certain specific information related to process, I can be like, hey check the document again, verify process two, see if it aligns here kind of like chatgpt in that conversational sense, you can keep going back and forth until you get the perfect one. Insert puts it into the reply window. Small changes. This whole part is going away pretty soon. So you won't have to edit and remove these things. And that way you've got a full email that's complete ready to go out. And that again makes life easier simpler on an everyday volumetric case. So, yeah, those are the three major AI pieces on hiver, that I think would be useful and would be helpful for a team of your size. So, yeah. So what are your thoughts outside the sentiment, the report and the automation capabilities on it? Do you think co pilot and tagging could also be useful for your team?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  We do tag certain things. We have our own knowledge base, but it is pretty cool how it will kind of search through it and give responses via hiver. But yeah, the sentiment piece is really where we were kind of intrigued on especially since it could draw attention to clients who may not be happy, you know. So client retention wise, it's something that really interested us. But you said that it doesn't come all cart right now, it's all or nothing kind of thing.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Right now, at this stage, the entire AI add on package is a full suite. I don't necessarily think we might offer a la carte at any point as far as I'm aware. Okay?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Okay. Awesome.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So yeah, with that said, I did want to check, you know, what is the appetite for, you know, additional sort of add on or an additional inclusion of a service like AI included within the whole thing for your team because the other side?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Whatever you decide.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sorry?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Sorry, go ahead. No.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I was just going to say the other side of, it will be for the whole subscription and you can't you know, have it just for one person, right?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Right, right. That's the other thing like it's really important for like our payroll team or our implementation team, basically anybody or in like customer support or client service. But there's other individuals on our team who are in hiver, who won't necessarily use it. So, applying to them, you know, 20 dollars a month for something that's not going to be useful for those individuals, might not make sense to us, but definitely, very intriguing, very interesting. I'll definitely have to go back and discuss it with my team and see, you know, if it's something we'd want to move forward. But thank you so much for the overview. That was very helpful to kind of see what other features you guys offer as well.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely, Desiree and a couple of other pointers. Is we're going to be launching a version of AI feature called AI quality assistant that will give you as a whole team, you know, across inboxes, it's going to give you the option to control tonality, verbiage, specific information being included. All while people are typing out a reply. So an admin can pretty much pre configure mandatory things and start tracking in the sense of reporting how agents are handling these emails. So there'll be like a going metric there'll be a way that says, hey, Raghav's got 10 scores out of the emails. He replied where he's always been professional. He's been using the greetings. He's been using the right data, right? So that one's launched on the eighteenth of November which is basically like 10 days from now. That again would be included within the suite if you do decide to go ahead with it. The other thing that I want to mention before I let you go for today is that I'm open to working with you in terms of a bit of an incentive on the 20 dollar per user per month price point. If you're willing to go ahead with it before the end of your trial as a whole AI piece in itself, right? Don't want to tell you that we are open to being a little flexible. I'll be a point of contact primarily and centrally for the whole commercial aspect of AI. I did notice that odita is your customer success manager as well. So let me give her a heads up internally. We'll you know, have a discussion about the pricing angle of things and, you know, would it make sense if we had like just like a 15 minute tentative check in on our calendars just to see what your internal reactions are like? And if you want to proceed with the paid angle?

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Okay. Yeah. I'll definitely. It's something I'll definitely have to bring back. I can't I'm not going to make a final decision right now, but yeah, yeah, but it's again something we're very interested in. So let me go back and discuss that, and then we can kind of go from there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. That makes total sense as well, Desiree. So, yeah, let me know whenever you have any questions or doubts about individual AI functionalities, features potential requirements that you foresee required for the AI side. And I can tell you if it's part of the roadmap. And yeah, after the call, I mean, realistically, before I close my day today, I'll send over a recording of our meeting. I'll send over some click through videos, and additional material on AI as a whole include the baseline pricing that I mentioned of 20 per person per month. You can reply on that email when you're ready, if you want to proceed, and we can discuss specifics on commercials and go ahead with things if it makes sense. Yep.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Awesome. Perfect. I appreciate your time. Thank you so much.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Absolutely, Desiree. Have a great day. Thanks for showing up, you as well.

CPP Desiree Fuentes (desiree@cirruspayroll.com):
  Thanks. Bye bye.
