================================================================================

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's up Adam?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, can you hear me?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Yeah. Can you hear me?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, I can. How are you? Good, how?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Are you today?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Doing well? I appreciate you hopping on the call, no problem. But just to set a quick agenda, Adam, I would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role. What got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay. Yeah, sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I can introduce myself first here. So, my name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the email management, customer experience space for a little over seven years now, and yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can help you all today.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay. My name is Adam. Sonny, been with vinworld for about five years now. I'm in the customer success manager role. So we're kind of a we're… expanding and we're starting on a new team with like a customer basically like sales slash like go between operations kind of thing. They kind of like vet what sales are getting and stuff like that. So, you know, currently with the way we operate, it's a lot of outlook role and stuff like that to kind of sort through and route requests properly. Yeah, or, you know, manual assignment like, hey, you take care of this one, forward an email to somebody or something like that… and, you know, everybody kind of does it differently. Like, I know, just like in my little cluster of four people sitting right here like we all do it differently, you know, but, you know, I do, I have folders per customer and rules that for, you know, per subject line or if it's from this person or whatever into buckets because I don't necessarily need to look at all of it, right? Like the person next to me just has a just has a, their inbox and they just go through and I don't really understand how he has it sorted. I couldn't sit at his desk and figure out what he was doing. Guy across from me. I don't really know how he does it.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  And the lady diagonal to me, she like just uses her inbox and then manually drags the files of the emails into each folder for each customer as she answers, you know, inquiries or something. So we kind of need to standardize that and make it a little more agile so we can get back to the customers quicker. Yeah, that's kind of what AI is for. It replaces all of us. That's really what we can use it for now, you know… so we are kind of looking at, you know, different options and seeing what one kind of fits our goal the most that's what brings us here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. No, that's super helpful. Adam. Just give me some of that context and just to understand further. So, are clients reaching out directly to your individual inboxes? Like are they reaching out to you directly, Adam, and you want to find a way to put them into a shared folder or are they reaching out to more of like a distribution list or like shared inbox?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Both?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And what are the shared inboxes distribution lists that you're managing today? Like how many are there and what? Like what are the different purposes for them?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  There's probably five or six different. We don't have any shared mailboxes. Everything's a distribution list. Okay? So we have like an ocean import one, you know, for ocean imports, we have an ocean export one. We have a air import one air pricing one and… like an overall like air freight one. Okay. And then rules, well, so the ocean ones are pretty straightforward, right? They're smaller departments. Currently, there's only two or three people in each between imports and exports. So that's not like a big deal, right? Like you just, hey, I'm taking this one, you know, or we know what, you know, we have to read it, determine what it's for like, oh, this one's asking for a rate. Okay. That's you. Oh, this one's asking for, hey, they're not going to make it back to port in time or they're picking up the empty container and they're having problems. That's going to be, you know, kind of based on role and responsibility, you kind of that's kind of how we sort through like the ocean freight ones… air freight has more rules applied to their, each person's inbox, where like if you're in the two line, it goes to your inbox. And, but if you're in like the CC line, it goes to like another folder because maybe not something you necessarily need to worry about, but just something you need to like kind of have a record of. But then within that, of course, you know, things can get lost. You know, they might have, you know, the customers aren't we can't hold our customer responsible for how they're going to put our names in the subject lines, you know? Yeah. So there's probably way more manual stuff going on behind the scenes in the air freight. Yeah. But, you know, the concept is there, it's just a matter of like refining it maybe, but then, you know, how everybody has their inbox set up. Again. That can be all different, you know, it's great that you have, you know, those two basic folders of your inbox or, you know, like the general air mailbox, but then how do you sort through it after that? You know, like that that's the other, you know, are people going to still bog down reading everything that they don't necessarily have to determine if it's theirs or not, you know? So. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. You know. So, it sounds like, you know, you're looking to standardize your email management processes around like these distribution lists, looking to streamline like AI and automation from like assignment replies and things of that nature. And then on top of that, just having better visibility into what's outstanding and what needs to be completed. So, things, you know, aren't slipping between the cracks.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Yeah, pretty much.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. So I can hop into a product demonstration here. Just showing, you know, hiver, how we help teams, you know, work with distribution lists who are leveraging outlook. Okay? So feel free to stop and ask any questions as we're going through it here today. But taking a look at my screen here, Adam, you know, what's nice about hiver for outlook is that, you know, we are, you know, very similar to an email client. So from a learning curve perspective, very easy to get your team up and running on this platform and get them familiar with it. And on top of that, like takes about, you know, about a week to get up and running with this solution. So it's a very light lift tool but very effective as well. So taking a look on the left hand side here, you're going to see a couple of different things. The first is the personal inbox. So we do have access to your personal email communications within hiver. And then below that are the distribution lists or shared mailboxes that we're you know, organizing for your team. And so you'll have a direct sso integration with Microsoft here, you won't need another login or password. You're just using that current outlook email password credentials and you'll get access to all of this. But taking a look at the support share mailbox for this example or support distribution lists. As I click into it, it's going to open some sub views beneath it that's going to help us manage the intake of communications. So the first is the mind view everything that's been assigned to me that I'm working on. And I need to complete. The next is the unassigned new emails that have hit the shared mailbox, that need to be distributed via automation or manual assignment. And then there's the team view. So here's where we can see Adam across this entire distribution list. What is our entire team working on that's associated with this distribution list? What's outstanding, and what needs to be completed? So I have two open conversations. Jeevan has one and you can literally click into our names to see what has the status open. Just want to pause right here. Any questions so far?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  No. Okay. No, that makes sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. And you can do bulk actions from here too. So let's say, yeah, you want to reroute these conversations to someone else to work. I can select on the two that I'm currently working on and just easily redistribute it to another team member to take on those tasks, you know, maybe change the status in one fell swoop or apply like a bulk tag or something along those lines. Okay? But going to the mind folder, right? I'll click in this email for this example. So when I click into this email, it's going to open up a hiver tab on the right hand side that's going to help us, you know, manage that communication itself. So the first thing we can do is assign the conversation. So in this case, I've assigned it to myself. Let the team know. I'm going to follow up with this and own this communication. The next way that we can assign work is a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the conversations as they come in. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So identifying those keywords in the subject line, maybe keywords or phrases in like the body of text of the email and then making sure it's going to that person every single time for follow up. Okay. Just curious, Adam, how do you envision would it be a combination of round Robin and skill based routing based on what your team is doing today? Or how do you envision that? Like in your workflow?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  I think it'd probably be more skill based… just like, you know, based on how it's set up currently, like, you know, somebody might do rates and sort of might do like actual like, you know, processes and actually processing shipment and stuff like that. I think skill based where it's actually recognizing. Okay, it's just a rate request, send it to the rates, you know, like the same person is going to handle that every time, you know, then once it gets over to that bucket, maybe then you have the round Robin… come in. But I think the initial request would probably be based on skill.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Okay. So try to do as much skill as possible. And then maybe the remaining requests can be like equally distributed or something like that.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then the other couple things Adam here like the status. So, you know, tracking whether the conversation is open pending or closed, ensuring that nothing slips between the cracks and that we're working through all these email communications to a resolution. So pending open is typically when you know, you have something to do on your side. Pending is when we're waiting on something from the client. And then closed is once we've worked through the entire process. Okay? And then the tags, so super helpful for organizing conversations. So you can use these tags to put emails in buckets folders or views. You can also use these tags to report on the back end to understand, you know, what are the hot topics we're seeing amongst our distribution lists? What are the requests that we've seen come in over the last, you know, day week, month, 90 days, whatever it might be?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the last on this little panel to the right is the custom field. So further way to view data, report on information and we can, you know, create drop down fields, text box, fields, value fields and date range fields to report on the back end.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But let's say, you know, we need someone to come into the conversation. You know, I can just shoot matt a note real quick right here. Being like, hey, can you help with this? He'll receive that notification on the left hand side over here? He'll click on it. It'll take him right to this thread where we can kind of keep having that back and forth conversation as we decide how we want to respond to the client. Maybe we'll use our AI summarizer to get up to speed on the conversation really quickly. But let's say we need more, let's say we need more information, Adam, like we want to be able to respond to this client. We just don't know the answer to a certain question.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We can actually leverage our AI copilot to generate replies. So we can feed our copilot like PDFS, word docs, website links, any internal documentation, that you would have to be helpful for your team to draft with more context and more efficiency. So I can select, let's say, you know, the second prompt here to request missing customer details to locate the sign up.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then I can insert this into the draft to either further edit or add more context, whatever it might be. Let me take a quick pause here, Adam. What are your thoughts on this so far?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  I mean, it definitely would speed things up a little bit and sort things through… the chat on… the side. I like a lot. It kind of eliminates the need for teams kind of because, you know, what ends up happening. A lot of people have conversations with teams and then it's not necessarily tied like to tie it back to like the email, right? It kind of you lose it, you know, like you'll never be able to piece it all together between, you know, what you discuss in teams and what you have in emails. So that chat all stays with this email string the whole time, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it lives on the email historically. So, if you ever need to go back and refer to it and that's what's also nice, right? You can always go back and refer to it. It doesn't get lost in a channel in like teams or slack or like something like that.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So let's like… if this person like, so you handle this one, right? And then the person comes back and they have another question, they don't you know, use the same subject line or something like that. Will it ask you if it's like, hey, you were dealing with this person Cole, you know, do you want to, is this yours that you want to handle or something like that? Or is it a it'll kind of go to it'll? Just go through a typical cycle, whatever we set up with it being, you know, skill based or around Robin or whatever. We. Yeah. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So if they reach back out on the original thread, it'll go back to the last person that was previously working it. So let's say, I like closed out this conversation and like a week went by and like, you know, they still had one more question. Like the client still had one more thing they wanted to say. That same thread will go back to that person if they started an entirely new thread or whatever. Then it would go back through the like standard skill based routing, round Robin, whatever it might be.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Gotcha.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we do also provide some pretty great analytics as well. Is there anything that you'd be looking to understand further from an analytical perspective?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  I mean, well, how fast is it responding tone? What… was the other one we went to see completion? You know, completion of response? Like, you know, are you answering in one shot or is it a bunch of back and forth? You know, how many of the people or the, you know, individuals are actually reading? You know, like are they getting to all their emails every day? Because like currently, there's no way of knowing that, you know, it's there's no, even if you went to everybody's computer, you would never know if they actually read all the emails every day. I mean, the only, you know, caveat to that is that like there is a lot of stuff that like we get that we don't necessarily have to read, right? Like within logistics, you know, you get a lot of booking information or, you know, booking updates, like for one booking confirmation from the carrier, you might get like eight emails, 10 emails and it's like, you know, some carriers send it to you four times the second you make the booking, then, you know, there's no difference in the information, just four different emails. Then you might get other carriers and it's like, oh, the departure date changed from, you know, 316 PM to 317 P. M. And then, you know, you get another email, you know, a week later or something else that we don't necessarily need to like look at per SE. There's a way I'm assuming to like whatever analytics that are being run to exclude some things, right? Or kind of.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, that's totally possible. So we can actually create like rules on the back end where we like identify email types that we can automatically close and exclude them from like the analytics. So that's like an automation that we can run kind of like filtering through those conversations that might be flowing in that don't need a prompted action.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, taking a look at like the last 90 days here, right? We can see, you know, active new resolve conversations over that time period. We can see some general performance metrics like what was our average first response time as a team within that distribution list or our average resolution time?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then breaking it down by user. So emails assigned per user email sent out per user. And then those individual performance metrics below.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So understanding, you know, what was Cole's average first response time and average resolution time over the last 90 days. It's taking me 350 hours to respond to an email. I'm probably not going to have my job on Monday.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  No, definitely not.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. It's taking me a couple weeks to respond there. So just a good way to understand, you know, how are people performing? Is there ways to improve? So we're either providing a better experience or driving towards like any slas that we've set as an organization?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we have the tag analytics. So just understanding, you know, why are people reaching out? What are the hot topics we're seeing across the distribution lists that our team is facing? You know, over any certain date range, SLA analytics for understanding, how are we performing against service level agreements? So let's say on the back end, we created like a service level agreement of we want to respond to all new emails within one hour when they come in and we want to try to resolve them within let's say 72 hours.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  This is where it will show us how many times we violated those first response or resolution slas, and how many times we're in compliance over that time period as well. Okay?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Do you have like an app for hours like… autoresponder maybe?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we do, we have an automation that we can create for not after hours but for a general autoresponder in general. But I think the autoresponder for after hours is being released over the next like month or so. But I would need to check with my product team on that exact release date, but I'm pretty sure the after hours one is being released shortly.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we do have the csat analytics. So just understanding, you know, client engagement and, you know, being able to collect those from an individual and aggregate perspective.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then going to the admin panel, I know we're coming up on 10 minutes here. So this is where we're going to set up the platform, set up the distribution list. So, you know, you go up here, hit create share mailbox, as you can see, we can use an outlook user account, outlook, share mailbox, or a distribution list or Microsoft three six five group to create these.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then once you create them, every single inbox is its own entity, you know, that can have its own tags, automations users. So I'll click into the support one here… and it's going to give me the ability to add or remove members, the people who have access to this for, you know, assignment collaboration, responding to emails. This is that general round Robin auto assignment that will equally distribute the work as it comes in amongst the team. And then those automations that we spoke about before. So being able to streamline certain things like, you know, maybe new conversation comes in, we've identified, you know, in the body of texts, the keywords like shipping or like requests like whatever keyword or phrase we're looking for within the body of text of that email. We're then going to assign this to, you know, myself because I deal with shipping requests. And then we can also trigger other actions, whether it's like adding a tag, sending a customized reply, sending a notification to leadership. But in this case, we'll just add a tag being like we'll call it high priority, right? Because it's a shipping request and those are typically time sensitive. And then from there, the high priority tag can trigger off like a certain SLA with a certain time.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then tying that to the slas, right? Let's say, you know that from that automation itself, it's going to trigger off for those slas. It was a high priority one that we had since it was tagged high priority through that automation. We're actually going to have a first response goal of 30 minutes and a resolution goal of 24 hours because we want to make sure we're doing this as efficiently effectively as possible when this request type comes in. And if we're not able to hit these goals, you can choose who gets notified in the platform to escalate the issue.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I think that's pretty much the main things I wanted to cover today, Adam. So just for a typical next step, what I usually recommend is we do offer a proof of concept or a free trial to get the team involved to start testing this to see if this could be of value. So just want to, you know, ask and see, is that something that you would be interested in setting up just based on the conversation today?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Yeah. I did have a question though, and this is only because when I was looking online like a lot of like the information online is like, oh, hiver is not good for outlook, but you were saying this is basically just like an add on for outlook which is kind of what everybody's doing. Anyway. Is it more geared towards Gmail or is it fine for outlook?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, our Gmail product, that was our first product to market that lives within the Google workspace. And then our outlook product is a standalone platform for outlook clients. We've had it for about two years now, but, you know, it's been a really effective product for people who have used it, and that's something we're like investing in heavily throughout the rest of this year and it's going to be a large focus for us next year.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Gotcha. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And yeah, totally able to test it like I want to make sure this is a fit for anything. So that's why I always recommend like try it first and then, you know, if it works great, we can start working on commercials and whatnot.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  okay. Now, is that like a sandbox testing environment or that can be like a live thing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we can either create a sandbox for you or we can create a live one totally up to you what you want to do.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay. I mean, I think a sandbox is a safer option. I don't want to throw everything off. But before I know, you know, it's one thing. Watching the Guy who's the product expert maneuver through, you know, of course, you know, where everything is right? But for myself, once I'm doing it on my own, like it's going to be a little more difficult. I don't want to throw a wrench in before I actually like have some comfort level with it. Do you guys like if we move forward and move forward? Like do you guys have like a authority helps out at installing everything instead of kind of getting everything initially set up or?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we'll like if you choose to move forward like we'll provide you with a dedicated customer success manager and they'll provide you with implementation team training onboarding, ensuring that we're mapping it out to your specific workflow. And then once you go live there'll, still be a resource that you can use, pull into consulting calls or whatever you need going forward.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So it's a fully, you know, white glove experience for getting teams up and running and how many people Adam total would be using something like this?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Probably, it's 30 to 40 currently, but expanding… 30 to 40 to start. And then, you know, within a year, we might be up to 60 to 70 based on how we're planning to grow.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And when, when would you want to be like, let's say you found the solution you want to move forward with? Like when ideally, would you want to be implemented in, live with a solution like this?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Probably January.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, it'd be something that, like you'd want to finalize a contract with, in December and start implementing like early January?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Yeah, most likely. Okay. It's probably a slower time of the year. So, it would probably be a good time to, to do something like this, you know?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. Yeah, December, 100 percent easy time to, when… everyone's on vacation and celebrating the holidays. Yeah, but when would be a good time for you, Adam to touch base? So, I can start working internally with my team to set up a, a sandbox, with some logins. Do, you know how many people you'd want to give access to the sandbox just so I can give my team, that insight?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Maybe two or three tops?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, I'll yeah, I'll create three, three for you guys, just so you have the additional, just in case. And then when would be a good time for you to touch base to go over the sandbox and make sure you can log in and all that stuff?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  And how long does it take to set up the sandbox at the care house? Like, are we talking about a day or two? Yeah, like a day or two.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I can probably get it spun up by like, Tuesday. So probably Wednesday would be a good time for me next week.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay. I can make Wednesday work?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And I can do same exact time as now on Wednesday, if that works for you?

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Yeah, that'll be fine.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. So, I'll just send this over as sandbox sync. And then, I'll also follow up with, this call recording some other additional information. So you have it, and then, if there's any other questions between now and then feel free to let me know, but it was great to, to meet you and looking forward to, getting you, up and running with the sandbox.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Yeah, sounds good. Sorry, one more quick question, within the system, it, you can like schedule meetings and everything, right? Like that's, part of, the… process, right? Like, if not, like, sorry, do you, like, I have an email back and forth, somebody I want to set up a meeting. Does it like automatically sync to my calendar or is that like a separate, separate thing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, we do not have the, the calendar integration to date, but that is something on our roadmap as well. Okay. That would still be, on the outlook side.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Gotcha. Okay. So, I guess, what things, are, currently, would still require outlook.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for pretty much just like the calendar, like scheduling your calendar, managing your calendar, that would be like the main thing.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I can also find out when we're going to have that calendar integration. I know that is on our roadmap. So I can, I can get some more insight in that as well.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But, it was great to meet you, Adam. I appreciate, your time and I hope you have a, a great weekend.

Adam Soney (adam.soney@vinworld.com):
  Thanks, man. You too.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Take care. Bye bye.
