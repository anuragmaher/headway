Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Bianca.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Hi, Cole. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you? I'm.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  doing okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice appreciate you hopping on the call here.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Yeah, of course.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I know we wanted to touch base to see how the sandbox was going and just talk about potential next steps in terms of establishing a partnership with hiver. So I'll just kick it on over to you to see how that's been going. And what makes the most sense from here?

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Yeah, I'm going to be honest, my team, my colleagues have not had necessarily an in depth chance. We walked through a little bit yesterday in a meeting, but I left it with them to be able to like kind of poke around, give me some questions to bring you. They have not done that quite yet. I will say I had a couple of questions about the sandbox first, and then I have a few it requirements because we're a public institution. And in Canada, I think there's just a few things I have to get from you in terms of information, but we can determine if we're even able to do the integrations like of our outlook system or Microsoft three six five system. So, my question is about the platform one. When you behave on the platform, does all of that get translated to outlook? So for example, if I delete an email on hiver, will it delete the email and put it into trash in my outlook as well?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I don't believe it will. So we do have read write integrations where it's like if you send an email in hiver, it'll reflect an outlook. Yeah, but I think from a deletion standpoint, if you're deleting it from within hiver. And my solution consultant is joining in one second. He'll clarify this. Yeah, it will not. And here it is right here, actually.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, what's up, Manoj?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Hi, Bianca.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  So, Bianca.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Was just running me through a question, Manoj about if we delete an email in hiver, will it delete in outlook? I don't believe it will, right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No, no, no. It's just going to get removed from the hiver interface.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Sorry, you're breaking up, Manoj?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  It's just going to be there in the hiver interface. So your outlook source account will still have those emails.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  I'm not sure if maybe it's my volume. I'm really having a hard time volume wise, even hearing you hold on.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Can you?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Hear me now?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's better.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  And.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  it's.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  done.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Manoj. You're breaking up again?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  I think it's I'm not sure with my let's say one second, one second, let me internet.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Good old technical difficulties.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  We live in an age of technology, so it's bound to happen.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Can you guys hear me now? Yes. Okay, perfect. So the source account, Bianca will still have those emails. Okay? Yeah.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  So, even if you, for example, like with hiver because you can like obviously add tags and stuff like that, I know that wouldn't be translated but I just want to confirm then basically our inbox the existing inbox, and just to be clear, this is not like a defining question. It's more of just understanding what it would look like on the outlook side if we were to for whatever reason log into the outlook separate from hiver, like our regular login, we would see then everything still in the inbox, like the true inbox, like it wouldn't get folded or filed in the same way the filing would only exist on the hiver platform straight on.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You're right?

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Okay, great. Yeah, that's helpful context. And then I did have a question about it requirements as well because we just the nature of the institution. We do require it's a pretty thorough committee that'll review a platform or something that we're looking to implement that needs connection to especially our existing systems just for the security purposes. I'm sure this is not the first time you've heard of this. So a couple of the things that our it team was looking to understand is the security risk and technical feasibility in general of like just how hiver connects to outlook. So, I know like we could connect with our Microsoft three to 65 account and stuff like that. And so, just wondering if that's available like details around what that would look like or what requirements would exist if that's on your website somewhere and I can find it or if there is like documents or something that you can send over that I could provide to our it team.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So just kind of how our integration with Microsoft works. Yeah, I can send you over those details, how we're working with Microsoft today. We definitely have that.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Okay, great. And just like what kind of like basically we just said from what I understand from them, I'm not an it expert. Obviously, it's just that they need to know what kind of access.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Level, right? Right? Yeah, it makes sense. Makes sense.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  But yes, that those are like honestly, those were the two main questions. And so I actually can't move forward until I get an okay from it anyways. I can even move forward with procurement until then. So if I can get that information, I can get it to them soon. They're quite quick in being able to review it. And then once that is able to happen, we can kind of decide on the next steps. Okay? If it's possible for the sandbox because my team is still looking at it, I gave them to the end of this week.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  So at end of day tomorrow, I don't know if the sandbox is scheduled to just close or whatever. But if we could have access till the end of day tomorrow, that would be great so that they could just make sure that they get any lingering questions out. And then you folks are welcome obviously to close it as needed.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then Manoj, when is that trial expiring for them? I think it's next week.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it is next week. Oh.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Okay, great.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. We have till next week, Friday at midnight.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Oh, okay. Excellent. Yeah, they should be. I did give them the deadline of tomorrow, but it's always nice to have some buffer room anyway. So that's great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. So I can send you over our hiver outlook security overview so you can share that with the team. Bianca, you'll have time to test on hiver. And then, you know, if we're all set from that perspective, we can start working on the commercials and kind of like the procurement process, yes.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Of course.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How would next week's same time work for you just to have like a touch base to see how, you know, the testing went and just like on the next steps?

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  I'm actually away for most of next week. So I'm here Thursday and Friday but I'm quite packed because of that. So could we meet Monday the seventeenth?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's perfect. So I just sent it over for the same time. Does that work for you? Yeah.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  That should be fine.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. So I'll follow up with the security document right after this, and then if there's any other questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Okay. Thanks so much.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Thank you, Bianca.

Bianca Taylor (bianca.taylor@utoronto.ca):
  Thank you. Have a great day.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Thank you.
