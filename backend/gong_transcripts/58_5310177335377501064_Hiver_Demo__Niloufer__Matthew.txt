Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  hi, Matthew.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, how are you?

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  I'm good. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Doing well, doing well. Give me one second here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Let me just send this real quick.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah… the agenda for the call today just wanted to help you determine if hiver can fit your needs and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  It does, the only downside is that I really not had a lot of time to play around hiver. Okay? So my understanding still be yesterday was also a stat holiday here. I did not get the time that I expected to have to play around and see if this really works. And I have been using, in fact, my mailbox was looking cluttered. And I disabled the… extension for some time because it was getting a little too cluttered as it is. I use a lot of folders. And on top of the folders that I'm using currently, it was a lot more that was coming up from the extension. So I explained to Preeti, I think who spoke with me the other day that our primary requirement is to have a shared inbox. So we would have like four parties accessing the shared inbox, and we would want all emails to be tackled by at least four others, you know, the four of the people who will be using this other than that, there's not a whole lot of features that we are right now looking to have. Okay. So that is our key requirement. But yeah, I mean that's where we stand right now. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So four people to manage a shared inbox.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  That's right? Like right now we have emails coming into each of these four, we are not, this is not kind of an admin role that I'm looking at. For instance, we have four parties primarily receiving emails and there are emails that can be tackled by let's say we have abcd and B would forward an email to C and there are things that either of them can address. But then because of the delay of C, it will be sitting there for some time. Whereas if it was accessible by all, it would have been addressed earlier, things like that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  So… that is where we stand. But in terms of making a decision whether to purchase this or not, I'm still nowhere honestly. So I have two options either to hold this for some time until I'm ready to play around and check again… or else. Yeah, I think that's the only option because right now, I'm not able to make a decision.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And then just while I have you here, can you see my screen? Awesome. And what's the email that you're looking to manage? Is it that admin email?

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  Well, so admin would be one of the emails. I have not tested this with the actual recipients yet because they're senior people. I don't want them to. We don't have the time for trial and error. I was using my personal email inbox and my admin email to test the features, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, yeah, super easy, right? You just connect the shared address that you have.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then all the emails are going to go into that folder so that everybody can see them. And then when you open the email, you're now going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can go ahead and assign it to each other.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  Yeah, this is what Priti had explained to me. Now, from what you're saying, there should be somebody assigning it, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  That is not what we're looking… for instance, imagine, you see the inbox on the top left, right? So this would be, imagine if this is my inbox right underneath that inbox, I would have another inbox for let's say, infoact, Right? So I could be working on out of my inbox or out of the infoact, correct? So we've got two inboxes here, Or let's disregard this inbox totally and imagine I'm tackling infoact, like you said now, But I should be able to respond and tag that either it is going from infoact, or it is going from my adminnet. We won't have anybody assigning anything to anyone but everyone using this inbox is, would have access to their personal inbox as well as the shared inbox.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  And whenever, say, for instance, we have four of us looking at the email from Steve, the emergency contact information. Okay? And I decide to tackle it. So I would immediately respond to it. Maybe I could flag it or maybe I could, you know, add a tag or something like that. And the others accessing this inbox would immediately know that I'm taking care of it. This is the kind of feature that we're looking at. Yep. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You could do that. So, yeah, once you have the folder set up, you'll see all the emails coming in. Everybody can see all the emails coming in and then whoever, if it's you or anybody from there can just simply reply to it and then everybody can see the replies.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  Everybody can see the replies. But what will happen to now? You just opened the email. What was the subject here? So, this one that you're looking at right now orientation, okay. Now that's tackled, go back to the unopened messages. So this is no longer there, right? Because it's been addressed, it is not an unread email anymore.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, no. It's still there.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  It's still there, but how would like, if you and I are sharing this, how would I see that? Would I be when you responded? Would you be putting a tag into it or something?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So if I reply to this email, you'll be able to see it.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  Yes, I'll be able to see it only if I go into the sent items isn't it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, you'd see it right here.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  Okay. But, right.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, you can see.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, anybody who comes in here could see that I replied also if it's taken care of, you can move it to the closed status, their statuses. And then that way it will actually disappear from here and go into the closed folder.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  Okay. That makes sense. All right. Yeah. So this is the kind of a demo that you have, right? This helps really, you're showing me how it works, really helps. And yeah. So the next question would be, what would the price be like?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we sell in buckets of five. So you'd probably only need our first option here, which is 25 dollars a user a month billed annually or if you wanted to do month to month, it's 35 dollars per person.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  So, it is per person? Yeah. That's a lot. So we're talking about 100 dollars a month for just the emails. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I'll have to discuss this, you know, because I found you as a result of me finding a solution for this problem that I just mentioned. So I just, you know, added the extension and tried to see how it works. And I would definitely have to have a chat with the decision makers with regards to this investment.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. No problem. Well, appreciate the time. Let us know if you have any questions, yeah.

Niloufer Perera (admin@abwmortgage.ca):
  Thank you, Matthew. Thank you for your time. All right. Thanks. Bye bye.
