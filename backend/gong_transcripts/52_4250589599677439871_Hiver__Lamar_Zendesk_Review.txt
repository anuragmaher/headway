================================================================================

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  not too much. How are you?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Hi, good morning. Is it still morning for you?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  We're top of the afternoon. It's like one P. M over here, ah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, good afternoon, then for us. It's well, half an hour from now. It's going to be midnight, so, pretty. Awesome.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Folks, if we're all settled and squared away, Jason's here. So just quickly recapping, Alex, you lead 30 second, intro, set the context and give both me and udita a couple of seconds to introduce ourselves. And then we'll go with the flow with me taking the lead wherever possible. Yeah… sweet. All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hello?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Hey, Jason. Hey, how's it going?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's going pretty good. You know, glad we were able to reconnect this week. I brought a few more people from my team from like the account management and customer success side of the house too.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Okay… quickly.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Introducing myself. Hey, Jason, I'm Raghav, I take care of the account management motion here at hiver.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I've been with the business for about eight years, now been in this space for a little over a decade, excited to continue building on the Lomar hiver partnership. And on that note, I'm going to pass it to udita, your dedicated success manager that you had a little bit of difficulty finding out.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks, Raghav, you had a little bit of difficulty finding your success manager. Jason, we have to change that.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah. Well, you know, we already have a few teams here that are using hiver have been for a while, and when I started looking into it, I was like, well, you know, who's our rep? And they were like, you know, we bought this, you know, several years ago, and we've honestly never had to reach out because everything's been working so well. So we don't know.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Well,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  that definitely sounds good. And we hope going forward, everything is going to go on exactly as expected and you don't need to reach out to us but we will be reaching out to you. So on that note, my name is udita, feel free to call me udi or udita, whichever you're comfortable with the answer to both of it. And as Raghav mentioned, I am your success manager at hiver. So I will be your primary point of contact for all things product. While Raghav will be responsible for the business side of things. I'll be the one that will be connecting with you on a regular basis monthly, quarterly, whatever is convenient for you. And, yeah, let's take this partnership forward. Okay, awesome. Yeah, krumm over to you. Sorry. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, Jason, I think today we wanted to kind of do a deeper dive into your Zendesk instance, we're just kind of curious if there's anything else that, you know, has come up since Friday and other areas you want to click into.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  No, not really. I basically, yeah, wanted to review kind of some things that are going on inside Zendesk to make sure they'll be able to come over to hiver, you know, with no problems, which I'm sure they will because I'm not a, you know, an expert at the back end of things like this, but from what I've been looking at so far, it looks like we're using it in a very simple way. So, but I just wanted to make sure, you know, before I go full on into it to make sure everything's going to work the way we're doing it now and no surprises when I get into it, you know?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  We're right there with you.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  And did.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  you say like sunny or somebody else from your team might be hopping in?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah, he was, but he's not going to make it. So I was just going to basically show him, you know, eventually he'll be on the next one, but, you know, just show him what it looks like and how it works, but since we're just going to be going through like the automations and stuff on his back in the Zendesk, it's probably, you know, he doesn't really need to be here for that, so.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Well.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sorry, go for it.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Oh, I'll let you take it away.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thanks man. So, yeah, Jason, in terms of, you know, the hiver to, you know, Zendesk to hiver switch, we've had quite a few organizations make that transition and migration successfully during my time here and we're confident with our updated tools and migration support in the last few months that we've built out. We're even more confident in the ability to have that migration done for you and ensure that it's as close to business as usual in terms of information and data that will be required. Alex's, point, some of the things that we wanted to chat about today was about the nitty gritties the must haves and, you know, what's really going to make hiver meaningful enough for the team as we head closer to a pilot kickoff or like a plan for a pilot in itself for the team as well? Okay. Yeah. So over to you to take it off. Feel free to share your screen, show us as much of Zendesk as you'd like to in terms of your workflows, processes, things like that. Feel free to highlight and tell us. Hey, this is important. We've got the whole thing being recorded and transcribed. So we'll make a summary of this and have a copy shared with you later, so we can have a more structured format in terms of things to cover and things to look at when we do the next call with sonny and the larger team.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. So you should be able to see my screen. Yeah. All right. So this is the admin center. And basically what I was looking at is… what is it down here? Objects and rules? I think I got to find it. So they call it triggers. I guess here. And I saw we have several and a lot of these, I know we're not going to there's stuff that's going to automatically happen with hiver. See, these are all haven't been triggered at all in seven days. So a lot of these are just in there from old stuff or whatever reason before my time that aren't used. So, but, you know, you can see there's like an automation here to assign for mobile ops. Basically says if a ticket comes in and it's received at mobileops, Lamar. Com, send that category ticket to open and send it to the mobile ops group. And I think there's another one in there too that says like anyone that comes in at mobile ops, send it to this specific person, you know, which I don't think would be a problem in itself either way. But there's a lot of stuff like that… stuff like, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Go ahead please.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah. See like there's a lot of these that say, like assign these to different groups like, you know, you have to set up an automation with Zendesk. Like if you have, we have all the different groups that use Zendesk. And they say like, you know, if a ticket comes in to helpdesk at Lamar, assign that to the support group. If a ticket comes in to web services at Lamar, assign to the web services group, but with hiver, that connects right to those inboxes already. And you assign the users to that group, right? So that's going to happen automatically already. Yeah, let me see if I can find one that I was more concerned about. See this one here is the side conversations thing. The side, I don't know if you're familiar with the side conversations, tickets like in Zendesk, if we have to like send something to somebody that's like I was telling in the first meeting, we have a servers group that technically doesn't use. They don't use Zendesk right now. So if we need to escalate something over to the networking team or whatever, we use, the side conversations feature forward the information in the ticket in the side conversation. And we say, hey, we have a little form we put in there that we paste in and it says customer information here's, the issue here's. The general issue here's what we tried before. Can you guys take a look at this? They in turn take a look at that and they can respond back to that and we see what they tell us to do or what they found, but the customer doesn't see that, you know, the end user doesn't see that and then we can go back and we can say, you know, we fixed it or no, you can't have that, whatever you know, so that's what that is. So that's a big part of what, you know, what we do is doing that. But I mean, I'm not opposed to getting that group into hiver, you know, if we need to make because they have an inbox too, just servers at Lamar. Com. So if we need to put them in there to make that kind of a situation possible that's you know, not a problem either, but we basically need a way to collaborate with other teams like that without the actual end user with the problem, seeing the internal collaboration between our teams.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Yeah. So to give you a summary, I'm sure Alex spoke about this on the last call when I checked out the transcript just to revalidate and reconfirm what Alex has told you. Yes, we do have site conversation capabilities with sharing capabilities as well. Obviously, as you'd expect best, easiest, simplest route is to get the team on hiver just so that the whole transition stays seamless intact and is easily accessible by leaders like yourself. But if not as well, there's definitely options we could explore in terms of individual functionality features that can achieve what you're doing with the sitecon wounds. And as today, right?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Because I mean, they pretty much live in their email anyway, which is all, you know, Google based. So, you know, it goes to that servers at Lamar. Com. Whatever member of that team is going to pick it up. They all see it. So whatever person's going to pick up that issue, they just reply back to that. It's all done through email. So if they're in hiver, it's basically just going to be seamless right into their email. Anyway, they all have that server's inbox in their Google inbox. So it's going to not look much different as it does now from what I understand, right? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. That's exactly right. So, the hiver way of approaching the site conversation is one of two routes. We either call it a shared conversation. And the name of the feature is permalink, or collaborators. And the second option is the notes as a feature. Now, the notes feature is pretty similar to the comment space that you'll have on Zendesk per ticket, right? Where you can just drop a stuff internally per team. Now, if you do bring the service team on hiver, that just opens up the scope, makes it easier on having everybody there for open collaboration or we can do that collaborator route. And is this server team the one that's on slack at this point? So remember something about slack. I.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Don't know if they're actually using anything for ticketing, I know they use Jira for like projects and stuff like that, but I don't know if they actually, you know, do like tickets, they don't get tickets sent like directly to them with issues. It comes through the help desk. And if it's something we can't handle, we escalate it to them and then they tell us what to do. Basically, you know?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So short answer to your question definitely can be automated. Two different routes we could explore and depending on which ones preferred by a team, we can take that route and get that going, right?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  All right. So, yeah, most of these like I said, I'm not worried about they're going to kind of happen automatically, but I did notice like I don't know what I saw. This one was triggered 40 times in less than seven days. I'm not sure what this it says, Jira app synced with Jira on ticket update and it says ticket is updated, ticket tag contains Jira escalated. Then it just says notified by active workbook and it's got some kind of a Jira Zendesk plugin. I don't know if we can tell what that's actually doing or, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So from what I can see, it looks like whenever the status of the Jira ticket is updated to escalated, it basically wants a notification going into Zendesk and hence back to the user as part of the workflow automation here. A very similar approach could be explored with hiver where, you know, we've got an inbuilt Jira integration out of the box as well. And we basically give you a panel on the right side where you can track both hiver and Jira. You can flip between the tools and easy switch. Essentially. Again, long story short, we could look at automating a similar alert or even, you know, dive into why do you need this alert? Like what does it actually achieve?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Right. And I need to do that too. I originally had a meeting with the people that are using that today, but it got punted because of scheduling issues. So I was going to ask that question before this meeting to find out, are they even still using that? Is that necessary? You know, but if it is necessary, the short answer is we could work something out that's going to make it, do it. Okay. All right. So, so there was a, there was another one that was similar and it might be a similar one like these down here for I need to, once again, I need to find out how much and what we're still doing with pager duty and all that. But, there's a bunch of these in there for pager duty, create linked incidences for service id, this or whatever. And they basically kind of say the same thing if one comes in contains pager duty tag ticket is created. And then active workbook pager duty integration there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So, I mean through hiver, the whole web angle of things would be taken the route via zapier. If, you know, in case we don't have an inbuilt integration out of the box with some of the tools that you might be using. Jira, we cover, we're good there clickup, we cover. So we're good there pager duty. We don't have an integration out of the box, but, you know, if they, if it's about having information updated on pager duty, depending on actions on hiver. Again, we could take the web book or the API route and we can solution a pathway to make that happen for you again for us at this point, it's nice that we are having this bird's eye overview if I call it that. But essentially, what would start making realistic sense is to your point, you know, you wrap up that internal discussion and we are able to identify and isolate, okay, Ninja, one pager duty, Jira, outcomes actions impact on the team that will basically help us position the pilot time. Yeah.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah, I'm not sure what this Ninja one, this is that's, our rmm service. You know, that we monitor our endpoints with. And I noticed this was created automatically by Ninja one and that's basically when ticket is closed, Send a notify active workbook on ticket, closed to some to the web hook in a Ninja. And I don't know if that was created at some point, cause at one point, I think they were looking at Ninja's ticketing system that, they have like some sort of a ticketing system. So I don't know instead, it was created automatically and you know what? That was a July, of this year, right? Of last year of, so that might've been when that happened. That might've been around the time they were looking, at the Ninja ticketing system. So I wonder if that's just something that somehow automatically happened if, when we wanted to take a look at their ticketing system.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely makes sense. And, you know, considering that.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  One's yeah, go ahead. Sorry. No.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I was just going to say considering the scope of the collaboration and the expansion at this point is from the it support help desk, positive, there might be a couple more of these that, you know, do show up now. In terms of these triggers, some of the things that hiver can handle out of the box without having to do any extra thinking is going to be any kind of designated ownership, which is routing of emails, smaller groups, server, team, ap, team, finance, team, id support, whatever be that case, depending on where the email shows up, what's going to be the triggers conditions, basically what matters to your team, right? The second part of it, the Jira integration, definitely, we can knock it out of the park. Might require a couple of tweaks here and there as we dive into the details of specifics and outcome in itself. But by and large, again, I don't see a problem with Jira and any kind of automation that triggers or notification does an action of assignment. Or maybe even if you don't have it right now, we could even check out automations down the line that could even send automated follow ups or reminders saying, hey, you reached out to it. It's been two days. Our team never heard back from you. Can you tell us if you're still talking about this?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Right, right. Definitely. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We can definitely do that.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  And we'll definitely set up some sort of a meeting with all the department heads that are currently using Zendesk and give them a demo and most of them are already aware of hiver because we have those teams that are using it here. So they won't be totally unfamiliar with it. But we'll do something like that for sure. So, this is the support email addresses we currently have and I'm going to have to tell us. I noticed most of these. I think it was kind of fast and furious when they set up with Zendesk stuff kind of got thrown in here but I noticed, you know, some of them are set up like a forward like the help desk one here, right? We just have a forward set up in help desk to forward to a corresponding Zendesk email address. Yeah, that's like help desk at Lamar five, five, seven, three, seven, five three at Zendesk. Com that in turn makes the ticket. But then we have some of them set up as just a straight Gmail connector like billing, you know, that's just a straight Gmail password. So, I don't know why some of them were set up that way. Some of them weren't and there's somehow a few that got set up with only like, you know, like only a Zendesk. And I noticed people are sending in tickets when they email in a ticket, they just send it to, you know, projects at Lamar seven five three dot Zendesk. Com, but we already have corresponding group emails here. We just have a projects at Lamar. Com. So they can just, and I noticed when they send it to this, the Lamar one is copied as well. So it's like, why are we sending it? Like, you know? So those are not going to be a problem. I'll just have to notify those teams like look if you have any vendors or any users that are sending emails directly to a Zendesk email, they need to just pop that out and use the direct Lamar email from now on. So, so, yeah, so that's all basically how we have it set up. It's all just either forwarded or straight Gmail connectors and the users just know like the help desk, they just email helpdesk at Lamar com already, you know, that's all they know, and they get an email back. And so, yeah, that's basically how we're using it, you know, there's no apis that I can see connected in here, you know, under the, you know, stuff like that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  What about like,

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  under automations and stuff, there's basically nothing there except for just to set to after we solve a ticket, after we solve a ticket, 48 hours after it goes to a solved, after we solve a ticket, 48 hours after that, it puts it to closed where it can't be modified anymore. It has to be a new ticket. And then this one just tells it that once we set a ticket to solved, it sends the csat, but that's only for help desk tickets. We have a trigger to, you know, it only sends those on help desk tickets. The other departments don't want the csats going out, which I, I'm pretty sure they told me that's possible with a hiver as well. You can tell it only to send csat for help desk tickets and not for the other teams.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. Yeah. So from the way I'm visualizing the long term picture here is that each team effectively that you showed us that forwarding address, I'm guessing they're a Google group or a distro list or an alias of?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Sorts. Yep. Each.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Of those becomes individual shared mailbox instances on hiver, just talking some jargon here. They're called shared mailbox instances on hiver, people can have depending on the seniority and the level of visibility they need part of all of those inboxes, part of some of them that's how we control cross team visibility for in dojo contributors in the team. And for management, you know, you get that top level visibility, common space where across five, 10 of these groups, you've got something assigned to you that shows up in a separate designated spot, obviously reporting as well could also be done at the mailbox level. So that way you've setting yourself up for scaling success with each department or subgroup individually.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Right? Modified specifically.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Based on their needs. And I'm sure it's not a one size fits all for all of them, right? So you get that you get that flexibility. And at the same time end of the day, you know, when you do want to consolidate stuff and have that bird's eye overview. It's all available all inside of Gmail.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Okay, great. And the ticket, like I'm assuming this is done through tags like on hiver, but like, you know, when a ticket comes into Zendesk and they're categorized like this is a password issue, this is a hardware issue. And so like say somebody wants to go in later and get a report and say, well, how many tickets did we solve that were password issues? How many did we solve that were hardware issues? I'm assuming you set up those tags on the help desk, and anytime it sees like that word in an email like my password is expired… or something, it tags that as a password. So then when you do the reporting, it pulls up everything with those tags. Is that how it goes 100?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Percent. And we actually have taken it a step above if I can call it that. How aware already is the team in the business when it comes to AI adoption with hiver?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Probably not very. That's something we're just getting into as a company, getting into AI, implementing AI. Of course, since we're a Google shop, we have some level of gemini and they're not quite finished opening that up for the whole company, but they have pushed it out to what we call our power users and department heads and stuff like that. And we have had some training from Google specifically a three part training class on gemini with those people. And so they're starting to use it and starting to get familiar with it. But as far as hiver goes, I don't know if they're using anything AI related in there right now, fair.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Enough. So, the reason why I ask that is because just like with Zendesk or just like any business in the world today, we've invested pretty heavily on AI and a lot of these tagging mechanism that you're talking about, right? We no longer need to rely on the presence of a keyword. Like somebody could just say, hey, I've been logged out of my account and I'm unsure how to log in and I could basically do that low lift as I call it work there, understand the context and be like, hey, this is a password reset without necessarily requiring the requester to use those words and use those keywords or phrases. So when I talk about AI with hiver, you'll hear me talk more and more about this in a future calls. But essentially, I'd like for us to look at AI with hiver in a two phase manner. The first phase is where can AI help that has the most impact but the least resistance from team members? And that's going to come from AI categorizing stuff, AI, being able to mark emails in a certain way, or just extracting data, showing it to the team for the user to take action based off of summaries key information, like what's the endpoint that they're trying to do, what kind of device are they trying to change? What team are they with, right?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Things like that could.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  be just initial AI adoption, AI gets that out, puts that in a space. The team member then tracks it, manually, does the part and gets a response out. So I don't want to tell you, hey, hiver is going to come in and do AI reprise all the way through, but we are heading in that direction. And between us and the partnership, we can take a phased approach where we take it one step at a time and make sure we validate accuracy and go from there. Yeah.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  That sounds good. Sounds exciting stuff. So, yeah. So the other thing I wanted to look at Bob, just looking at these now, these macros, I'm pretty sure these are basically equivalent of like candid responses to stuff like we have one here that I made for third contact attempt. If somebody doesn't respond to us, we don't want to close tickets to them, we know they're resolved. But if we do three contact attempts and they don't we respond back, we do that, but they call them a macro, we can enter it and it tells us, you know, hi, we attempted to contact you multiple times. We're assuming it's resolved basically and then close the ticket. But that's I don't think they're called candid responses, but they have something in hiver, right? For stuff like that preset responses. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We should be able to get you sorted with preset responses, exact macros like this. Thanks Alex. We call these templates on hiver?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Templates that's what it is, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Templates, it's the same thing, different name at the end of the day, right? So, same way, you know, you've got macros triggers on Zendesk, we encapsulate everything and we call it automations at the end of the day, right?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Gotcha. Okay. So just might be.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  A little bit of nomenclature of relearning and unlearning that the team has to do. But in terms of achieving a desired outcome, we've got in terms of almost all that I've seen with you so far, at least hiver's can't knock it out of the park. Yeah.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  And I see a lot of these don't get used a lot anyway. Only a few of them get used any kind of regular. So, yeah. So I'm sure we'll be able to migrate that stuff over as well. One question we did have from the last one was, and it's not a big deal. It just would be nice to have that. We weren't sure if hiver can do is right now, you know, when we send these csat surveys with Zendesk as a tickets. Sometimes we'll get a user that accidentally clicks a negative rating or they click a negative rating. Then they change their mind. They really didn't mean to, they were happy and we have the ability to send them a link in the ticketing system that allows them within a certain timeframe to go back and modify their feedback. Is that something that hiver can do or no?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So with hiver, we've actually solved for that in a different lens. What we've done is first, we've made sure no internal entries are registered to begin with, right? So we could, if you prefer have it in such a way where nobody from Lamar com could leave a rating for each other. But in your case, I don't think that will be relevant because I'm guessing most of your conversations are with internal employees and other departments and stakeholders, right? Yeah.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  We're pretty much 100 percent internal it. So basically, you know, after we do a help desk ticket, you know, just we give them a survey to say, you know, right to the level of service that the help desk provided you. Basically, yeah. And I do track that, you know, to see the percentage and all that and how good we're doing it, but we don't use it for KPIs or performance reviews or anything like that. But, you know, I do like the opportunity to fix the ones that are in error and put those back to positive reviews. So we have better numbers, you know?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, definitely. And to answer that question, we do have the ability where you can resend a csat survey as we call it where basically if it's an erroneous one or somebody's just clicked something that they didn't mean to, but have changed their mind later. You can definitely send out another csat survey in itself, have that capture another side of it. And again, this is what I call low lift AI is we could also have AI on the background non visible to the agents, start capturing sentiments as well across the board. I like.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  That I like that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  One will be csats that are purely user generated. And there's one that's AI driven and consolidate both, compare them against each other. You probably might have a more wider scope and a better picture in terms of what's happening in these accounts. Yeah.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  I like that. I like that. And eventually I think they do want to get to the point where other departments are doing the csat surveys, but for the foreseeable future, they want it just on the help desk. But everything sounds really good. I think, what you guys have here is going to do what we want in a better way than we're doing now in a simpler way where it integrates with the email. And I know my team is going to love that because before we had any kind of ticketing system before Zendesk, they didn't even use a ticketing system. We had, they just used the Gmail, the help desk account and they made a subfolder for each agent and they would just move those tickets into their folders for the tickets they were going to work and they liked it. And so they loved that kind of interface, you know, working in the Gmail environment. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's great to hear Jason because that's one of the biggest advantages of having hiver. While at the outset, we might look like, hey, it's a simple easy to use solution out of the box, the kind of functionality and complexities we've built under the hood over the last eight years or so. As long as I've been here, it's been pretty fascinating as a journey. And one of our biggest core points here when it comes to teams migrating off of a standalone tool like Zendesk is that you get to use the best of both Gmail and hiver out of the gate. So you're no longer restricted to just what hiver has and launches and is restricting you to. But if you're like, hey, I like to have 10 different colors of stars in my Gmail. And outside of hiver, I still want to do that for my personal account separately because that's my preference that's the kind of avenue that hiver opens up for you purely because of the fact that we exist inside that Gmail ecosystem.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Right, right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, that's great. One question. I did want to find out though, Jason, because last time I remember there was a brief conversation about forms or a customer portal. Did you have any chance to sort of flesh that thought out?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Well, I was just wondering, you know, I just answered there was a customer portal, but I mean, right now we're just 100 percent. Everybody that makes a ticket just sends in an email. You know, they don't use a portal. I don't know how much use that would get anyway. But it might be something we look at down the road where people who just have an icon on their desktop where they click this. I need to enter a support ticket. I can just click this icon and go. And that way they can keep track of all their tickets that they, you know, that they have that they submitted in the past, you know, stuff like that. But knowing… our users in my short time that I've been here since June, I don't know how much that would get adopted anyway because they're so ingrained into just sending an email. And just, and a lot of people, even the people that work for us that are on the support teams, they don't even go into Zendesk, they basically just use it through email because they, it comes as an email to them. If they get tagged on a ticket, whatever, they just reply back to their email. So the I'd probably say 80 percent of the department heads don't even open Zendesk ever. They're just using it out of their email already. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's great. No, I mean, the reason why I brought that up is if you do need to explore something like, that is functionality that we're that we already have in terms of like, you know, can handle about 40 50 percent of what your typical customer portal requirements might be basic optimizations, color formatting, things like that options, visibility, sso, logins and things like that for pass through tickets that's available. So to my initial can be part of a phased approach. You know, we can maybe have that stood up three six months after we kick off the major team in itself.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Oh, yeah. It'll be longer than that anyway before we're probably ready to adopt that. And the other thing when I mentioned portals, the first time was like, you know, like which you showed me, they do have like an admin portal for like our department heads to go in and do reporting. And like you said, I was a little misguided at first as to what hiver was. It seemed like it was very simple, not a lot of features. But now, you know, as I got more into it and I looked at it internally with the departments that do use it. I, and then with my first meeting with you guys with Alex, I saw that it, you know, does have all these things on the back end and the, you know, all the automations and all the stuff that can happen and the reporting and all that stuff. So, I'm… glad we took a second look at it when I first started exploring different ticketing systems. I kind of, I kind of overlooked hiver and, you know, I'm glad we took another look at that. Actually, one of the ladies here that uses it was like, hey, we got three teams already using this. I think you need to take a deeper dive into it. And I said, well, let me go take a look. And, and I'm glad I did because I think this is going to be the best solution. So we were looking at invigate before. And as I kind of got into it with them, it's just, I don't know, it seems kind of sloppy to me and difficult to set up. It's very similar to all the stuff that all the people here don't like about Zendesk. It's kind of similar with them. So even though their pricing is very attractive, I think it's going to be a very cumbersome migration if we went in that route. So I'm kind of leaning to the hiver direction now.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  So I think the next steps would be as I want to… well, you know, I need to hammer out the pricing and everything of course, first and see if we can get to, where we need to be on that, which I think we will and set up a demo like I was talking about with all the department heads and I can give them some time to gather questions and stuff like that beforehand and that way they can ask any questions they might be concerned about and get a demo of how it works and all that stuff. A.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  100 percent. Right. So, Jason, in terms of asking… I'm sorry, I just lost my train of thought there. What I was going to say, Jason, the scope and the scale of the kind of pilot and the kind of implementation we're going to be looking at here, we would love to take a bit of a broken down approach as we call it. Basically, you know, we do cohorts instead of all the team leads in one meeting and everybody tries to get their questions answered. We can take like different meetings. I'm more than comfortable doing different sessions, maybe one session per team as well if it comes down to it, just so that we get right down to the granularity of things one, yeah.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah, I agree. But I was thinking about, you know, doing one meeting with all those departments just to do the demo, of course, so they can see how it works. It's just a broad overview of how the system works, what their daily life would look like using it. And then after that, we can say, okay, you saw this demo, gather up all your questions, all your concerns, and then we can do the focused meetings with each team and then go from there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. That sounds like a plan that's exactly what I was going for. So, I love that we're on the same page there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Another thing, excuse me, that would help us in terms of preparation for me for running the demo and future calls, make sure hybrid stakeholders are aware of any needs that might come up down the line. If there's any semblance or a similar pattern to an RFP or something like that we could formulate. Maybe it could just be, you know, you send us a conscious, a bunch of screenshots of some of these triggers and these macros and that you're showing just so we can understand what kind of outcomes you're tracking for. The way, the reason I'm asking for that is because, and, you know, you don't have to do it tomorrow or the day after. But essentially, once you do have that information over to me, that'll make it easier. So that I talk about some of these during that broad overview. Instead of just saying, you know, boilerplate demo, this is what hybrid does. And that way basis that the teams can formulate the questions, the focus meetings could have more meaningful results. And from a hybrid side of, it also gives us time to prep, you know, in case there's any functionality, smaller touches, tweaks we need to do that make.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  it easier, oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Definitely. I'll gather that before we do the focus meetings, I can gather their individual concerns, first relay that to you guys and then that way you can be ready. Yeah, definitely. But like I said, most of them if not all of them have probably never been into the admin side of Zendesk. They probably don't know any of this and what's going on. And, you know… like I said, they basically, I think they're just using it very simply unless I've missed something, but I've talked to pretty much all of them internally and I'm pretty sure it's going to be a pretty easy sell, you know, for them got.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It. All right. A couple more questions or other next steps in terms of understanding and formulating that in terms of commercials, we're happy to run that. In parallel. I wouldn't want to hold us down purely because we haven't agreed or gotten sign off on pricing in itself. So I did get a sense of your price range in terms of your Zendesk contract and what you're looking paying at today versus what you're hoping to target in terms of price points from your last call with krumm. I'm curious just to reconfirm or reiterate that we're looking at anywhere between 101 20 user group. And you're potentially looking to keep the costs at around 100 K, end to end across the board for the software, right?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah, somewhere around there, yeah, I mean, initially, we had been paying around 160 a year, 160 K for Zendesk, but, you know, of course, once we told them we were leaving in an effort to keep us, they were telling us we'll knock it down to a 99 but we've you know, my boss has already, you know, he replied back to just today as a matter of fact. Tell him, look, we already told you guys, we made the decision. There's nothing you can do you could give it to us for free and we're not staying basically as we told him… but yeah, the pricing we were getting from emugate, like I said, it was very attractive. I think it was around 60 K or something like that, but that, like I said, it's kind of a too good to be true situation. I don't think it's going to work well for us and I'm not getting good. I don't know what you want to call it good vibes from their support team and how they respond to stuff. I think they're a very small team over there. There might be one person in the support team, you know? So I was like that's why their pricing is so low because they don't have anybody working there. So, but yeah, so yeah, that's basically where we're looking to be at, you know, definitely, you know, price wasn't the, a consideration in why we're leaving Zendesk, but they definitely did feel it was overpriced. We were paying too much. So we definitely do want to stay in that range, you know, if at all possible somewhere close to that area. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Definitely. That makes sense. And if you might, you know, if you mind me asking, why are you leaving Zendesk?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Well, for one, nobody really likes it. Two. What really made my boss, Peter, he's a VP of it. When we went through the renewal, the most recent renewal process, it was very uncomfortable renewal process. They were trying to force us into this top level support that was going to increase costs substantially and we were willing to do a three year deal. They were still charging us the retail price per agent. They wouldn't give us a discount. They acted like they were giving us a discount for like 10 bucks a month per person. But then we also had to go with this support, you know, this top level, whatever they called it premier support or something they were coming out with and they basically wouldn't work with us at all. And we have several contacts of Zendesk resellers and we know what they get it for and we know, and for our size account, we knew they could do something better and they were basically refusing to do so. And I don't know if they said something during one of those, but he basically took it as a personal insult and was like, you know, we're not, you know, we're just we're going to let it auto renew for the one more year at our current price which was back in September or whatever that was. And when that runs out, we're moving off and we've paid that. So we're you know, we're already paid up through our subscription through it's either end of August or September or something in that range. And and so, you know, basically said that's it, we're done. You know, he said told me start looking for a replacement, all right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. That, you know, also gives me a bit of clarity in terms of the kind of mind space that you and your leadership team is coming from, moving off of Zendesk. I was trying to find out, you know, was it like lack of functionality, lack of fees, just purely pricing or just a combination of?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  All of this, right? Kind of, yeah, that's in the functions. A lot of their stuff doesn't work well, you know, stuff like that too. Some of the, some of the stuff doesn't seem to work good. And Zendesk was kind of forced upon the company… they're doing some like a conversion into oracle with a lot of our applications getting converted into the cloud. And they basically said, well, you guys aren't using any kind of ticketing system, you need something. And then it came down from the top level said, look, somebody at the top went and found Zendesk and were like, look implement this. Now. We need to start using this. So it kind of got thrust upon everybody from the start. So that's how we ended up with Zendesk in the beginning. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. No, that makes total sense. So, Jason, from here, in terms of moving the conversation forward and keeping it progressively going from the hybrid side of it, what I'd like to do is reserve commercial discussions for till after we do the next call, if that's okay with you? Just because we've got the timeline, we've got time. What I do really want to find out is, the scope of the implementation, the kind of tools functionalities that the team needs, make sure that we kick that discussion off. And that'll give me sufficient leg room as well internally. Given the partnership we've had with Lamar over the years as well to sort of look at the best pricing option. Obviously from what I'm hearing it's does seem like you'd be open to multi year, you know, with the right controls and with the right measures in place to make sure that you're not locked in case the software doesn't do its job, which it is like, I'm confident hybrid can handle based on what I've seen what you're throwing at it, but I understand businesses need that bit of a safety net as well. So, yeah.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So let's do one thing. Jason. If you could, you know, basis your last discussion, maybe try to find some common time with sunny and we can have the discussion more from that lens of okay, one, two three. Why is it needed? What's outcome, things like that? Or if you'd want to do the general hybrid demo overview or hybrid product overview across the board and kick it off with that. We're open to both, I'll be your primary point of contact during this phase of validating implementation scoping and commercial, so that there's going to be supporting me throughout as well. So you'd see both of us popping into the meetings. And so as next steps from the hybrid side of it, what I'll do is I'll send you a follow up email after the call with my scheduler link, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Use that, as a guiding measure. But if you don't find slots there that you think will work for the rest of the crowd, just show me a line and I'll move some meeting rounds. If I have to make some time available for the team. Ideally, I'd like to set us up for another 45 minute to one hour session, one hour, preferably to do like a broad overview of the hybrid product end to end on Gmail. And then to your point focus meetings pertaining to each department and each requirements individually. Okay?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah. I think that's a good idea. It probably would be good to have another short one first with me. And, sonny works for me. He's the help desk supervisor, but he's been here like 20 years and so he knows a lot about what everybody else does in the building in the company. So, yeah, I'd like him to get a look at it and how it works and everything. And then shortly after, like you said, yeah, we'll schedule the broad demo for the department heads to… you know, so they can all see how it works and all that stuff. And then we'll move on from there to the focused type stuff.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  100 percent. Do you have scheduler open by any chance? You know, I've got mine open and if you want, we can just.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Let me look here. I know sonny is out from tomorrow through Monday for a vacation. So he'll be back next Tuesday all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right next Tuesday, let.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Me see here. I can see his calendar as well. So, I'm free on the third and looks like sonny is free except for between 10 and 10 30 central.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Just give me one minute.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  So, and then Wednesday looks pretty similar. I'm available Wednesday, except for between… like 10 and 11… all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. So you said it's wide open except for 10 to 11 central, right?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yes. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. I've got a pretty wide open Tuesday on the first half of Central Time as well. Just going to make sure that the time zone I'm tracking is central. And yeah, it is all right. So if you want to do Brighton early nine a, M to 10 a M central Tuesday, I can block us out for like a one hour tentative block? Okay?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah, I don't think we'll need an hour just to show, you know, to talk with sonny, but yeah, we can block off an hour if you want. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And we can, you know, end it early if we're done and we don't have anything else to chat about yet, right?

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Right. Yeah, I just want him to get a feel for it. And like I said, he's been here so long, he'll know very quickly if he likes it. And I think he is, I've already told him about it and he loves big Google Guy. And like I said, used to use Gmail exclusively as our ticketing. And so, yeah. So I think it'll be, you know, sooner than an hour, but that's fine. Let's block off an hour just in case.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly. All right. So, I've sent us an invite, Tuesday, third of feb, nine to 10 a. M Central Time. I don't have sonny's email address. Could you like put it on chat or let me know? And I'll just type it out and make sure he gets it. Yes.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  I've just got to find the… chat here. I've got my, you're.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  good. I've.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  got my screen, full screen. Here we go there it is.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  There you go.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Got that. All right. There we go. Perfect. Sonny weathers. Sweet. All right, Jason, I've blocked the both of us and the hiver team stakeholders as well for the call third of February nine to 10 a M Central Time. Looking forward to chatting with you and sonny on the third of feb. And the primary agenda for that is just going to be to hear sonny and yours inputs in terms of a bit more detail and granularity and how things function. I'm more than happy to show a 20 30 minute overview on specific feature set or general broad overview of the platform as well. And we can use that time to run through both of those. We use that as a kickoff of the scoping process in itself. Based on the outcomes. From there, we'll plan up time for a full detailed hybrid demonstration across the board generic for the team leaders at large, and then do the focus meetings now in parallel. After the next call, I should be in a better place to have a discussion with leadership in terms of scope scale. Just so I've given you some commercial options to start the discussion with realistically at a more mature stage in the conversation. I would love to involve our chief sales officer or our VP of success alongside your VP of it as well just to make the executives align. And you get a sense of all the people you're working with at hiver, not just me, Alex and udita.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Yeah, yep. Sounds good. All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Sweet. That's it for me for right now quickly passing it to Alex and udita in case there's anything that might be popping top of mind for them?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Nothing from my side, to be honest, I just wrote on the chat box. Unfortunately, my calendar is booked on Tuesday, so I might not be able to join unless it gets cleared, but of course, Raghav, you and I can connect to post the call and we can have a discussion on this. But Jason, it was lovely meeting you and we're very excited to working with you and hopefully we will be able to check all of the criteria for which you're looking at hiver and provide you the best kind of service and product.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thank you, sweet stuff. Yeah, great. Catching up, Jason. You're in great hands with this team… you know where to find me as needed.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Good. Seeing you again for sure. I appreciate you setting it up for us.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right, folks. It's been a pleasure chatting with everybody, Jason. Thanks again for your time and for the next meeting. Excited to kick things off and get the wheels motion. I mean, get the wheels turning. Wow. All right. Bye, folks. Take care. All.

Jason Blevins (jason.blevins@lamar.com):
  Right, guys. Good meeting. You guys. Have a good one. Take care.
