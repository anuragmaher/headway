Lesco:
  hey,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Paul, this is matt with hiver.

Lesco:
  Hi. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good. How are you doing?

Lesco:
  I'm, good. I'm having some computer problems here, but other than that, we're doing great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, no problem at all. Glad we got it figured out here.

Lesco:
  No, I don't have it figured out, but I've got the meeting done. So… yeah, I got a major problem with my computer. So tell me about your company and what you guys do, and maybe we can figure out a way to work together.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So I could definitely do that. Wanted to spend the first couple minutes here, just kind of getting an understanding of kind of what your motivations were for booking this meeting today.

Lesco:
  Yeah. So… we have a basic need… to have a general email which we have right now. Info at eurodex. Com, is our inbox, right? Right. And that is a Gmail account.

Lesco:
  And now I have a new computer system that uses individual email addresses. So I created individual email addresses from our, in our Gmail, and I have five email addresses, and I want to have one collaborative inbox that drives from info at eurodex. Com. Forwards to all the individual email addresses.

Lesco:
  And then I want whoever opens or closes or processes an email to update all the other users that inbox was updated. Then when somebody emails to an individual email address, I want it to forward to the info, So everybody can see it. And everybody can see if it was processed and I don't know how to do that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah, absolutely. So that's fairly accurate to exactly what hiver does with a couple caveats here. But yeah, I'll get into it. Can you see my screen?

Lesco:
  I can.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, we're a certified Google partner. So, how it works is you simply download the hiver extension and you, your team members are all going to download hiver, whoever needs access to this, right, right? And once you download it, you're going to see these yellow icons in the top right here, and then these yellow icons down here in the left. So you're going to have your personal emails just like normal. They're actually not connected to hiver. And then what you're going to see here down here is a folder. And what we, you know, for you, we'll call this a folder info and it's going to be tied to that info at eurodex email. Okay? And every single time, so then you and your team are all going to have this folder in here in yellow. It's going to be called info. Every single time somebody emails that info email, it's going to land in this unassigned folder. So, this folder lets everybody know that somebody needs to take this email. And now, when you open the emails, once you have hiver, you're going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can go ahead and assign it to each other or yourself. So I can assign it to myself here. You're going to see it's. Actually going to leave that unassigned folder because it's now assigned to me. So it lets everybody know like, okay, this email is being taken by matt.

Lesco:
  Okay.

Lesco:
  So then if I email or hit reply, where's it going to reply from?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it's up to, you can reply from the info email or you can reply from your personal email, you can actually set that.

Lesco:
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then when.

Lesco:
  I reply… nobody else in the group can see that I replied. Is that correct? No?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, actually, with hiver, everybody… in the group can see that reply.

Lesco:
  Oh, good. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Because that's one of the main uses of hiver is that you no longer have to like CC or forward people, right? Like everyone can see the replies here in this folder. That way, it's very clear… right? So you'll see here, you can see all the replies. So you're going to be able to see who's working on it, and you could see all the replies as well.

Lesco:
  Even after it's been assigned.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly.

Lesco:
  Okay. And if someone emails to my personal email address, can I set up, can I have it forwarded to the info too though?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So that's the, a little bit of a caveat. So, yes, yes, yes, you can. It's a bit more manual, but basically, if you get a personal email like this is just spam, but whatever, once my personal email here, you're going to see this button here that says add to shared inbox. So you do have to.

Lesco:
  Automatically forward.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Doesn't we could do an automatic forward. It's gonna, it's it would be a bit, it would put you in our different packaging which I can go over as well, but I'm not sure what, exactly what your budget is, but basically, I'm showing you a work around here. So I'll show you the two ways we can do it. So there's two ways so you could do it where you just hit this it.

Lesco:
  Can't be manual? I'm going to stop. It can't be manual because it's based on, if I'm not in.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, I see. Got it. Okay. So, let's talk about that, then, let me go in here. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We do have individual inbox automations where it could be automatically… added to that inbox. And we can only, we currently, we can only do it based off two ways. So we can do it off of the, from email or from domain. Is it the same? Is it the same domain every time?

Lesco:
  Yeah, it's all eurodex. Com.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. But the emails, how do you know which emails, how would, hiver, has to know how to, like which emails to forward straight into that inbox.

Lesco:
  Well, it's going to, it's going to forward all emails. So all emails that go to pcortese at eurodex. Com will be forwarded to info. Com, and all emails that come into info will get forwarded to pcortese. It's almost like a circle.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. So you want it set up?

Lesco:
  So that, so here's the problem I've got, I'm going to have customers that are going to be emailing to info. And then I've got other customers are going to be emailing to pcortese or gbatalia, or kathykelly, and we have to be able to see all emails coming in at all times and I don't know how to do it because I don't think it can be done.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So, wait, I'm thinking this through here, we might have a solution for you. So that email that you mentioned the P, one that's your personal, your work email?

Lesco:
  It's my personal work email.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, I mean, listen, we could, the problem is that we could connect it to the hiver inbox here, but that would give your team visibility into all your emails as.

Lesco:
  Well, that's good. That's what we want.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Lesco:
  Right now, this is how we operate. We have one email address and we all log in under the same login id and we all work on the same email… but now we have to change the personal emails and I don't want to, but I have to, and I'm trying to merge the info eurodex for the last 30 years into these new email addresses and I don't know how to do it and I haven't been able to find anybody who can, although I look up the Gmail features and it says I can create a group and I can do all this stuff, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, I guess also.

Lesco:
  Collaborative like a collaborative email inbox?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, okay. So, so basically, there's customers that are emailing your team's personal inbox as well, right?

Lesco:
  Personal, they're going to email our personal, once they know that I have my own personal, some will think it's better to email me personally. Others are just going to be automatically emailing to the old email address info.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, I mean, listen, we could, yeah, we could tie all your emails to a folder in hiver. It's just every email is going to come through. So, do you ever get emails that, to that email? That like you don't want your team to see that? That would be the only hesitation.

Lesco:
  No, no. Okay. It's all work related. It's all good. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. Then. Yeah. Then then I'm almost 100 percent positive that we could do that. So we,

Lesco:
  but how does it stop the duplication of emails? Like if I email something, if somebody emails P cortese, and it's going to go to P cortese, but it's also going to go to info and info. Anything that comes into info is going to be forwarded to P cortese, wouldn't I get the same email over and over again.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, not necessarily in hiver. As long as you don't have that setting set up in Google, then you won't need to do that in hiver. So basically how it's going to work in hiver, is we're going to have a folder here? We'll call it info, right? And then what we're going to do is when you set up these folders in hiver, is, you see here we tie the emails that are associated to it. So we're just going to tell hiver that the info email and, you know, you all your team's emails are going to be associated with this folder. So anytime somebody emails your personal emails or this info email, it's going to land in this folder. So, we're not setting it up to do that forwarding. So as long as you don't have that set up on your end, it's not going to duplicate.

Lesco:
  I don't I lost you. I don't understand this. This is the problem. I don't understand this well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So basically how it works is it's we're going to set up a folder in hiver, right? And that folder is going to be tied to your info email. It's going to be tied to your team's, personal emails, right? So when.

Lesco:
  you say folder, why aren't you saying inbox?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Because, in hiver, it's a folder that's tied to being tied to emails.

Lesco:
  Being tied to an inbox.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. And in your case, it's going to be tied to multiple inboxes, right? It's going to be tied to info and your personal emails.

Lesco:
  So, my habit would be, instead of going into my inbox, I'm going to go into that folder from now on?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly.

Lesco:
  And that folder is going to be called my P cortese folder.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can call whatever you want.

Lesco:
  Okay. And I'll be looking at my email. So all the people that email me personally are going to come in there and it's going to, but how am I going to know what it is? Is it going to, is it going to give me where it came from?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, well.

Lesco:
  Yeah, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You'll see you'll see where the email is from?

Lesco:
  Not where it's from, but where it was originally sent to.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, yeah. It'll show that it'll show the sent.

Lesco:
  So it'll.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  show if it was sent to info or your email or your.

Lesco:
  P cortese or G battaglia or whoever. I don't know. I can't get my head around this.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, it's yours is a little bit different of a use case, but I'm almost positive we could do it and you got, how many people on your team? Five? You you?

Lesco:
  Five? Yeah. I think there's five of us, five of us total. No, four, there's four, four people, but there's five there's info. And then there's four more email addresses.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Well, well, the thing that I would recommend for us again, cause we had to test this out is that we have a, we have a free seven day trial. Yeah. So we could try to, we could set this up and see if it works.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then I'm just going to run it by one person on my end after this call just to double check to see if there's anything that I'm not thinking about why it wouldn't work, but.

Lesco:
  Right. So just so you understand, and I just want to reiterate. So the info at eurodex. Com is the primary email address. It is Gmail based. And right now, every email we get comes into info. Once we start responding and emailing from our personal email addresses, people will be automatically replying to those personal email addresses and they'll either going to update their databases and our contacts and change it to our personal, or they're going to leave it the same and they're going to use both, right? Because we deal with big corporations and they're moronic, stupid. I know I sound stupid, but they are moronic, they don't change anything. They're just, they do all kinds of, some people will just email four different email addresses at once and they just data dump, you know?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Lesco:
  So, so it's like we just have to make sure we don't miss anything because it's all sales oriented business, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Lesco:
  But the problem is what we want to be able to do because we work in a time zone. We want to be able to make sure that if something sees somebody, if somebody sees something that's time of the essence, they take it over.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Got it. Okay. Yeah.

Lesco:
  All right. So take a look at that and then let's get let's reconvene, when you can confirm, you think you can do it and then we'll talk about how it gets done.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, basically, yeah. Once I confirm it can get done, what I'll do is I'm going to email you, and ideally, we set up like another 30 minute call and we're going to, we're, going to download hiver and get it set up for you so that you guys can test it.

Lesco:
  Okay. Sounds good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Alrighty. Thanks Paul.

Lesco:
  Appreciate it. Sorry, I was short but I've got a massive computer problem and I'm trying to figure it out.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, no worries. No worries. Appreciate the time.

Lesco:
  Appreciate you. Thank you. Bye. Take care bye.
