================================================================================

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Andrea. This is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  Hi, matt. Yeah, I can hear you. No problem.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. How you doing?

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  I'm doing fine. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Doing good. Take everybody a minute here to join. And then Andrea, what's your role over there?

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  I am our operations manager. So I work under Lindsay on supply chain on various sourcing… and operational… working with our commands and stuff.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. And then we got Jessica here too. I think we're just waiting for Lindsay at this point. Jessica, can you hear me?

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Hi. Yeah. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Doing well. How you doing?

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Good, good. Thanks.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. And then I have you as the procurement manager over there.

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Yeah, that's correct. And I work under Lindsay as well. Right now. It's kind of a new thing. So eventually I'll be going into more strategic planning and kind of overviewing all of the procurement kind of department.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Well, appreciate you joining here. And looks like we got Lindsay too. Hey guys.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  How?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Are you? Good, good. Thanks, Lindsay. So, yeah. So for those that don't know, my name is matt senior account executive here at hiver, agenda for the call today, wanted to just kind of recap the conversation that I had with Lindsay. Maybe we could get some extra input from the other team members here as well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then from there, I'm going to walk through the product and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Definitely. Thank you. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No problem. And then, yeah, also on my line is Jeevan he's just going to be an additional resource here. He's been at the company hiver for many years here. So just wanted to add him to the call just to be an additional resource.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, thanks, matt. I'm going to be here. Like matt said, I currently lead the sales team here at hiver. I've been at the business for seven years and counting. So I have a lot of experience working with our customers and procurement and… sort of we, matt and I recently, the reason I wanted to jump on is matt and I recently worked with another procurement and operations team over at thrive market. And we found that there was a lot of application and success that we could that we were able to deliver. So, yeah, just hoping to pass on any relevant learnings from that and also just coordinate any specific product tasks as well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. And then, yeah, just to recap the conversation I have with Lindsay and what's going on over there right now, you guys aren't really using anything. You have these shared distribution lists where you're ordering things like raw materials… you know, shared processes and you're looking to track those, track the statuses of these, right? And currently with nothing in place, things could be falling through the cracks. And there's no visibility on the statuses of these emails across these distribution lists. Just wanted to get some feedback on that. Was there anything else that you wanted to add to that or anything that was top of mind?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  No, that's perfect. Summary, definitely just quick growth over here. So we're trying to figure out how to get visibility everywhere right now.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So yeah, I just wanted to do a quick background about the company here for Andrea and… Jessica that weren't on the last call, but a little bit about hiver, AI, customer service, help desk platform. We have over… 200 employees. We have over 2000 paid customers in over 50 countries with teams using our platform ranging from small businesses, E commerce companies, all the way up to some of the largest companies in the world, companies like openai, capital, one, just to name a few. And really, you know, a lot of the reasons that people come to us is that when you're not using anything and you're just using email, it's hard, right? You don't know, it's unclear who's accountable for these emails. Things are falling through the cracks. You often have to forward CC or DM people to get updates. You're wasting time manually routing and tagging these emails. There is no unified view of the past conversations that you have. You often have to switch between different applications and there's no way to track your team's response times. And just kind of the impact that you can see with using something like hiver is just getting faster response times, making sure that the right answers are getting to the right people deflecting these tickets, maybe these reoccurring tickets and emails that you're getting providing a consistent on brand communication across these different distribution lists, faster ramp up times by using our different templates and AI features that we have saving a ton of time for the team by reducing manual effort, and then just smarter operations and getting better insights into these distribution lists.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  While matt pulls that up, Lindsay took a peek at this last week or just a few days ago, based on just what we've seen, even if matt and I were to just say distribution lists. And this is something that I'm just curious about. Are there any sort of specific scenarios that potentially could be frustrating, could be error prone in your current day to day that you just wanted to highlight so that we could potentially build into that during matt's presentation?

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  I think for me, I think Lindsay probably explained it pretty thoroughly but it's just that we get a massive influx of emails all of us. And as the team grows, we're distributing the processing of these emails, these receipts, these automatic reports that we get to different team members. And with the increased volume of business that we're doing… we need a way to have a double check that the emails are getting processed in a timely manner. So, I think, I don't know if I could pinpoint a frustration per SE. It's more of just things slipping through the cracks, right? We get a report on October first and it gets missed all of October. And then now it's November and how can we prevent that in the future?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. I think that's really helpful… Jessica if you wanted to add something or even if once matt starts, I think once we maybe start connecting some of these dots, I think more questions might come up. So let us know. But I just wanted to sort of see whether you had anything to add. Go ahead, matt.

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Awesome. I was just going to say I'm curious to kind of just see you guys walk through it. And I think once you do that, then I'll have more like questions as we go along.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. Yep. Absolutely. I.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  Think one thing too because Lindsay sent us some resources and I looked over it in advance. We don't really in our department. We don't really have like we don't do tickets, like customer support tickets. We're more of processing and ensuring the documents were emailed or processed. So, I think that was, I was able to follow the demonstration that I looked at. But if we can orient it more towards like a raw material processing versus ticket, customer service type of thing. I think that will help us a little bit more if that makes sense.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And I think that makes a lot of sense. What matt's going to walk you through is hiver and the way a lot of our customers use it. And why I think we've seen the success that we have is that we want to give you like a really nice sweet spot between the both the things that you just said, right? We understand that this is a lot of it is just email management and being able to give you and the team the tools required to first of all, easily organize delegate and work on these emails without any of them slipping through. And also of course, being able to reply to them a lot better. So that those are the two themes that you're going to see with matt's presentation in shortly, some of those teams do spill over or have overlap with customer support teams. So that's exactly why 50 percent of our customer base is using us like purely as a ticketing system, and the other 50 percent is actually using us for more. What you said earlier, which is email management, making sure that it makes it easy to triage, organize and reply. And so, yeah, so it's a nice little sweet spot right in the middle.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, can you guys see my screen? Awesome? So yeah, so hiver, we're a certified Google partner. You simply download the hiver extension. And then once you download the extension in your personal work email, you're going to see these yellow icons up here and then these yellow icons down here on the left, which is hiver. So unlike some of these other platforms out there, it's all conveniently located in your personal email. So you don't need to go and switch applications. You can answer your personal emails just like normal. They're not connected to hiver. And then you're going to also be able to get the notifications and then have quick access to those distribution lists down here on the left. So I'll just click on one of these folders. Each folder can be tied to a different shared address that you have, right? And anytime somebody emails that shared distribution list, it's going to land here in the unassigned folder. So everyone's going to be able to see which emails have not been addressed and need to get handled… right? So let me just click on one here. And when you open these emails, you're now going to have this hiver panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you're going to be able to easily assign it to the different users in the account. Once you assign it to somebody, they're going to get notified that they've been assigned this email. And there's also a mind folder here where everyone's going to be able to easily see all the emails that have been assigned to them. We can also create automations where these emails can get automatically assigned to people on your team. One of the ways we could do that is by keywords. So for instance, if somebody on your team handles all the invoices, we can set up automation so that whenever the word invoice or words similar to invoice or any kind of accounting terms come in, we can have it, get auto assigned to that person who handles those emails. There's also statuses open pending, closed. So you can see the status of these emails. And then there's tags where you can categorize these emails as well. These tags can also be applied via automations. It can also be applied via AI. So you can essentially tell the AI on the backend how you want these tags to be applied. And then hiver will start doing it. And then we can also run reporting as well for those tags… I have.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  A quick question very specific already. So we frequently receive invoices to our department and nobody on our team actually processes them. It's not our responsibility. It's our finance department. Is there functionality… in this software that if we receive an invoice and our finance team is not copied on, it could be forwarded to an inbox?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, typically, we don't have forwarding as one of the automation rules because Gmail's a little tight on the rules with forwarding because they don't want to be able to just forward out mass emails. So we don't typically have forwarding rules. But however, if we were to use this and if the finance team is also on hiver, what we do have functionality to do Andreas. And this actually was the point I was trying to make earlier. As soon as this email comes in. The first, if you want it to the first thing that's going to actually process this email is not a human being. It's our AI, right? So, what our AI is doing is it is reading the email processing. It, giving you a lot of different cues. For example, on my screen right here, right at the top, there's a section called neutral, right? So that's telling the tone of the email, whether in, somewhere down the line, if it becomes a little frustrated, it picks up a frustrated tone, it's going to change color and change the face as well. So that's one secondly on the right. Like matt said, it's going to tag. And also if you see there's a ticket summary there, which is actually going to process that email and give you a summary of what that query is or what that email is about. Now, one of the things it does do is if you tell it, hey, if an email comes in with just an invoice, it's not for us. And if the finance team is also in hiver, and they also have one of these folders that matt sees on the left, what hiver is going to be able to do is automatically detect it, remove it from your inbox and add it to theirs.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay. That's good to know.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we have the functionality. It's just that they would have to be a part of hiver as well.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay. Thank you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. And yeah, then we have different custom fields here. These are completely customizable, so you can create dropdowns for things like priority. You could track things along with dates. Jeevan mentioned this AI extract here where the AI can provide actually a summary of the emails coming in and can even take actions off of it, right? So as Jeevan mentioned, if an email comes in and this needs to go to a different team within hiver, we can set that up and it would automatically go to the finance team there. We also have different workflows too. If you wanted to set up a workflow where this needs to get approved by multiple people on your team. And then down here's, the notes section. This is where you can take notes and then also you hit the app button here. Everyone's name in the hiver account pops up and you can communicate back and forwards within hiver on these emails… and you can attach documents et cetera. Down there.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You can also reply to these emails directly here. In hiver, you can set up email templates that can be shared with the team. So these are for these like repeatable emails that you're getting just to quickly provide a response to these emails. We also have an AI chat gpt where you can quickly fix the grammar, make it more professional, make it more empathetic. And then we have an AI copilot which can actually draft replies for you. It learns from the emails that you're getting. And also it's going to ask a three prompt clarifying question. You choose the one that you want. And it can also reference a knowledge base. You have the ability to set up a knowledge base within hiver that you can make available externally or internally. And then also it can reference various documents and URL sites as well. So just to provide a contextual answer.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I just want to add a couple of things there, right? So, one of the things that a lot of people ask us, hey, we're in Gmail, we've got gemini already. What's different about the AI, right? So, I think the most fundamental piece there, what it learns from, right? It actually learns from you're saying that a lot of these emails are not maybe things that are like conversations or tickets. It's more about what we have to do once we receive those emails, right? So for new people joining the team, all of those processes and workflows could be uploaded as even a PDF onto hiver. Hiver will learn from that content and will be able to provide answers on what to do, what is the next step here based on what your processes are internally. And it's going to be literally helping team resolve quickly, but also get answers quickly based on the email that is in front of them.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. And then there's the team view here. This is going to allow you to see all the open emails across the team and who's working on them, the type of emails, right? So, for this example email here, we have 18 open emails. I can clearly see who is assigned on these emails. I can see the tags here, what they're about. And I can also see these red lightning bolts here, which are slas, so these are custom service level agreements that you can set up. And they could be like, for example, if nobody responds to an email within two hours to let us know or let notify certain people on your team that these emails are late… right? So I can click on any of these emails this late one here. I can see all the back and forwards. I can see when the email came in, I can respond to it. I could even close it out… but this view is just going to allow you to again make sure nothing falls through the cracks, allow you to get notified on any emails that haven't been responded in a timely matter, easily, see who's working on what. And conveniently here, we can see Jeevan has three emails. Let's just say that he's out sick for the week. I can take all of his emails here and just simply assign them to somebody else.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  So you probably can't assign the same email to two people or?

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Can you?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You cannot assign an email to two people. What you can do is create custom views on the left, where instead of something just like a team, if two people are both need to be looking after a certain group of emails, we can put those emails in a separate folder, give the two people that in question access to the folder like that. And then they can operate out of that folder. So you can assign it to one person. But you can give people access to folders like max showing you on the left. Okay, thank you. So you can customize, right? So the objective of the team section is sort of two four and I'm only saying this because going back to what you said earlier, which is we are, our volume has grown so much where we're not able to put maybe a safety net in place. So I guess the first word that usually comes to my mind when I talk through this with my customers is safety net because what this lets you do is see emails come in, if they've been assigned, if they've been replied to, they've been processed or not, because everything has a marker there that lets you know exactly what process has been made, exactly what replies have happened. And these replies, like matt said, you don't have to be cc'd or forwarded these emails. You can still see the replies and everything that's happened there. Every action on hiver is logged and timestamped. And you can also set rules that say this email needs to get responded to by this time, almost setting a due date for it. And when that due date is missed, you get notified. So the objective is when this volume comes in, we give you the tools to easily delegate and respond. But also then track and ensure that not one of these emails are slipping.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Through.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then the other thing you could do too, like if you need multiple people's attention on a single email as well is just make sure you leverage the communication piece down here. So you can always add, mention that other person and be like, hey, make sure to this… right? And they'll also conveniently get notified up here. And then all they need to do is click on that and they'll get brought right to that email.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  As a 200 person international company that uses hiver every day, we do a lot of communication directly there in the notes. When I log in the morning or even in the afternoon, I can clearly see those notifications coming through and quickly go to those emails.

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Matthew, I had a question, just wanted to get clarification. So is this mostly for like group emails or does it also work for individual emails?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  When you say individual, what are you referring to? Jessica?

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Like emailing just to my personal one or is it like group header, like operations at, or accounting at Serenity kids where multiple people are tied to that email?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That is what it's ideally meant for. It's meant for, this is a tool that is meant to manage one single intake or multiple intakes, as you can tell, but for one at a time, but one intake with group of people managing that volume, this is meant for that where actually not kicking in on any of your inbox emails, those remain private to you unless you do want to share them for whatever reason.

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay. Because I have, I'm curious about some of its capabilities and if it could help me with my individual emails.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  So, Jessie, how we'd want to use this here is think less about like the person or like you and think about the position. So in the future, if we have one person that places a po, we would want that to be in this inbox. And then we would tag it however, you know, po placed whatever. And then if we're arranging the transportation, we would want that tag. And so it would all be visible to everybody that's using it. So they can see what stage it's at. It's you know, it's in transit. It's delayed. It needs a coa, whatever it is. And so if you're sending a personal email, you can still do that well. We would want to function all through our shared inbox for the stuff that's shared. So like all of our po placement, all of our like transportation, all of our logistics. And then we have our normal reports that come in too. So we get inventory reports, you know, who's owning managing that inventory report and how can we like tag it, track it? Our receipts right now that come in, right? It's like right now we get all these receipts and matt, Maya, Andrea and Madison all handle different receipts. So we would want that to categorize. And then when they're done, we'd want them to show done one way or another versus right now they send an email saying like I received this. And then at the end of the month, we have to go through and be like, did they miss any receipts? You know? So it's like that all of our shared positions, we'd want to use the inbox. But if you're just emailing somebody, you can do it sidebar on your own email with your own tags, you know? Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And just to,

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  I know they're talking about ticketing systems and we did talk about if we move to a ticketing system period, we already have one we use for customer service. But so for this, I'm less worried about AI. I think it's cool that it exists, but we'll use it just to its capability. Like we can manually assign stuff if we need to. So not super worried about that. And then all of the tracking like who's getting the most and how much time does it take? Really cool. But also kind of a, you know, for us. I just want this to categorize where everything is at in the process. And so if somebody takes a day off, we all have visibility to that like at all times that's the main thing for us.

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Yeah, gotcha.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Kitting coas, operations, all of those, the finance part, I think that was a really good question. Andrea, like if we could say, okay finance isn't copied. I mean, maybe we could just throw it into a folder and make sure it all gets to them. That would be helpful too. Something like that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep, exactly. That context helps a lot. Yep. But yeah, with hiver, with those group emails that you have, you're going to have this team view here where you can easily see all the items that are open, the ones that are closed, the items that need to take action as well. The one thing you could do with individual emails just because you brought that up is if you ever get an email to your personal email and you're like, hey, this is actually an email that we should all collaborate on together. You can quickly add it to a shared address. And then that way everybody can see that email and everybody can collaborate on it. So I just took this spam from clickup, not spam, but whatever it is, and then added it to the support folder here. And you can see now that it's going to be living in the support folder and everybody can now see it. So that's the other benefit of hiver, right? Of course, is that now, like Lindsey said, everybody can see these emails, what needs to get taken care of? What has, you know, the actions of all those items?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And while the AI stuff and everything is something that we've actively invested in over the last few months and the predominance of this year since our launch in maybe, so maybe in the beginning of the year, the core problem that we were solving is the shared email visibility problem. So that continues to be our focus area. And the first sort of essence of that Jessica, just to answer your question, is these distribution list emails I assume are just going to everyone's inbox. The first thing that we're going to do is stop that, right? If you still want them in your inbox, we can always enable it. But by default, we don't want any of these distribution list emails to actually go into your main inbox. We want them to all to skip the hiver users' main inboxes and go into dedicated like collaborative spaces where actions are synced across. So everyone knows whatever anyone else is up to. And if there are still people outside of hiver receiving those emails, they still receive it in the exact same way, no changes for them. But people within have now consolidated spaces where they can work out of.

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Gotcha. Yeah, that'd be much cleaner. Thank you for explaining that.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  So, what does that look like? I'm curious because so we get one of the largest sets of emails we get is our bols every time our three PL ships out goods. And I Lindsay, I don't even know if terra actually processes them from the inbox or not. But sometimes I do look up shipments just to get a copy of a Bol because it'll be like a packaging transfer that I'm handling and I want to have that original Bol. So could I just look it up in the shared folders since it wouldn't be like I wouldn't go to my main inbox to look it up? I'd have to go to the shared inbox to find it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Not necessarily. So, how would you typically look it up?

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  An id number like a transfer number or a po number?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that doesn't go away at all. And in fact, we can make this easier for you. Because what, one of the one of the little bit little, really cool tricks that the AI does is it can like really grab maybe an id number and like store it in the notes so that when you go into the search bar and like search for, it can actually pull up all emails relating to the invoice number like that we've got right now. And more importantly, long story short that search that you see on top. That is all inclusive, right? It includes hiver stuff. It includes your personal inbox stuff. So we make sure of that. So you are able to search for emails in the search bar and it'll pull up hiver stuff as well.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay. That answers my question. Thank you.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Yeah. And Andrea, that kind of drove this to be honest with you because Clint and Tara are both using that. And so like Clint's filing it and it's the same thing and at a way higher volume. So we'll use our, I think it's like an orders inbox or something. We'll use that kind of combined in here too for all of our bols.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  It's a good question that's high volume right now for sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And the other thing we could do as well, I know we touched on it briefly is we could create custom views, right? So it doesn't just have to be unassigned team view, right? You have the ability to create custom views. And with these custom views, you can call them. I think you're calling these bols, right? Is that what they're called? Yeah, awesome. So, yeah. So like for these bols, if we had those tagged, we could create a view that's called bols… right? And then with all the Bol tags, we would just grab it. And basically, in this view here, it would be all those Bol tags, I mean, be all the Bol emails.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So we can create custom views with those tags with those certain emails. And then once you have that view set up, you can easily just click on it and you just easily see, okay, these are all the Bol emails that we have. So it'd be even easier to find them.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So what this does is like we said, we can set up like simple rules in the backend, it doesn't even have to be like majorly using AI. It's just simple keyword filtering where it can categorize emails for you. And based on the categories, we can create these folders or these views as we call them. What this essentially does is it gives easy access to whatever that particular user is in charge of or is responsible for. They don't have to go through an entire list of emails to see what matters to them. So as you can tell next to these emails, next to these views. On the left, there are these little stars. So you could actually each person can have their own different set of starred views or favorite views so that they only look at what's matter. They're not going into the team section in case they don't want to, they can simply just go into, the sections that matter to them and see and pick up emails that they are responsible for.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. Like I started this billing issue one, it has filters for to catch all the emails that have billing issues. And now it's conveniently right there for me.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And if matt and I were in charge of billing issues every day, the way we'd set up the billing issues, that little view there is essentially and we are showing you the ability of just creating open and pending emails which means that as you process them, they will go, they will go away from the view, right? So it becomes almost a dynamic list. So as you are processing them, you mark it as closed. It goes away. And then the next one comes in and it gets categorized accordingly that comes back into the view. And so it only shows you, the ones that demand your attention. And it's never going to have things that you have completed in there. So it's almost like a checklist for the team.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And the other thing I wanted to touch on here too, Lindsey and I talked about last time is some of our integrations that we have… right? Lindsey mentioned, I believe you're using Asana Shopify… and quickbooks. Are there three?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  I've got Trello and Netsuite in there too and slack actually wow.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Full house.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That's a full house there. Okay. Got it. So, yep. So these are all native integrations that we have. They have different abilities. But what a lot of them, one of the things they can do is we have these cards which I can show you. And essentially next to these emails, it can bring in different information from these different solutions such, you know, I have Asana pulled up here. It'll bring through like you can bring through the task, name, the description, the project, the assignee, et cetera. And we can bring through these cards on all these different solutions that you have. So I'll just show you some of them. So when you have the hiver panel pulled up here, you're going to have your apps, and then on the right here, depending on the integration that you have set up, you'll have these cards which will pull through the information that you choose from.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Speaking of, so, Lindsey, you mentioned Netsuite, so could you just walk me through? Yeah. So matt's going to walk you through the ability to create objects in all of these other tools, right from inside hiver. So, for example, you want to create a task in Asana, you can do that from, without leaving here. But we actually do something really cool with Netsuite which happens to be one of our larger… like, very fleshed out integration. So, Andrea, when you see an email from maybe Netsuite and it's got like an order id in there, would it help to, would you be in a position to get information from Netsuite about that particular order or what does that workflow look like?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  So we're using Netsuite, we're a little bit new to it. We started in April but we aren't currently using like if we place a po, we aren't currently using the communication in there, we're just downloading it and attaching it to an email.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  That was kind of our first plan was to use Netsuite but it's a little cumbersome. Yeah. But I mean we're using it for everything for transfers and shipments and all of it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So matt, can I just share a screen for a second? I just want to like pull up something, one of the cool things that we do specifically with Netsuite but we can do this with as you can imagine with most other tools as well is ability to give you a smart preview of Netsuite, right? Let me just quickly pull up… specific email which has got a po number in there, right? So if you've got an email like this, which is going to be pulling up a purchase order and it's in there, what hiver is going to do is first and foremost be able to pull information about that specific order from Netsuite right here and give you a clickable option that's one but two. And more importantly, it's also going to be able to actually pull it up in the email and actually give you a smart preview right here. So if a purchase order exists on something you want to pull up, it automatically triages that information grabs it and it gives you a nice little preview right here. And you can customize this any way you want. But this will involve or will reduce the impact of actually copying and putting it in some other place and getting information and coming back here. It's going to just like consolidate everything without you doing much.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Oh, that's cool. I didn't realize that. Yeah, that's definitely interesting.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Like I said, there's so much we can do with Netsuite, we can automate a bunch of like options. Like if there are any standard things that your team does on a repeated basis, we can definitely look at automating that because our integration is actually really powerful. So, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Andrea, Jessica, any other questions that any other scenarios that come to mind that would might be beneficial to run through?

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  I have a couple specifics. I just, I don't want to send you guys down the rabbit holes. I kind of want to just hear more before I dive deep.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I think Iman, is there anything else you wanted us to cover based on the conversation with Lindsay? If not, no, we're happy.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  To, yeah, no, no, that's essentially, yeah.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  I just have a quick question about like settings like appearance of inbox, basically like for example, density, like I like working in a compacted inbox like this. And I know some other people like, you know, default or comfortable, what does that look like in the shared space? Is it just whatever my inbox is set as?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So none of that goes away. So all of this functionality stays the same, right? And we just add a layer on top. The one thing that we do require is conversation view. And that is also because that's the only way for us to enforce some sort of continuity for the team. So, if one person's handling a conversation, the only way for us to be able to offer the next person some sort of context and continuities for them to see everything in one place. So, conversation view is the only settings that is required. Everything else is same as your inbox, the style, the folders, the labels, all of that remain the same. We're just adding extra on top of it.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay. Thank you.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Jessica. I think you had a question?

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Yeah. I was just thinking so for one of our commands, every time I issue a po, we have to let them know exactly what's coming in and we have them create what's called an FD number. It's just a corresponding po in their system that's related to our po number. And then I also have to tie that back. So I have to give that back to my supplier and, or my freight partner. So I'm wondering if it's smart enough that it could do something where it's automatically creating a draft to either do an FD request or if it's smart enough there, once I get the FD that it gives it to and creates a draft to the corresponding po.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We can potentially explore both right now. I'm just going to give you an example of what our workflow builder does and you can build as simple and also as complex a workflow with this as possible. So our workflow builder is very simple. It's a, when event occurs if condition is met, take action, right? So that is the general structure. We can customize this to any way you want. So let's do example one. And then maybe we can flesh out example two as well. Example one is essentially you're saying, hey, every time an email comes in with a particular order number, I have to request one in return so that I can update my supplier and my shipping partner and whoever. So that is the case. So you can say when a new conversation is received, if the particular domain or it comes in or it has particular keywords in the subject or the body, or you want to just sort of like extract it via AI and then also process it. That's also an option which is literally you're telling our AI to process the email, extract meaning. And if this meaning matches what you're putting it into this workflow, then you trigger a certain action. So both things are available. But let's go simple. Let's say if the body contains the word purchase order or new purchase order… then you can automatically ask hiver to send a reply requesting a number in return.

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Gotcha. I definitely think the second part, I mean from what it seems like would be easy to set up. So when I send the requests out, they're all individual emails separately, I'll just title it FD requests and then I'll also title the corresponding po number. So if it's po, yes, 100, they'll respond back and generate an FD for me. So maybe like a if then condition, if you see an FD number in the body of an email, then create a draft to the corresponding po in the title, something like that. Absolutely. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And like I said, in terms of like the condition, so I just want to walk you through like in terms of trigger, we've got email related triggers but we've also got internal stuff as well. So whenever something is changed internally, a tag is added. So if you want to say FD request and that you adding that tag can trigger an email, can trigger an action as well, right? And then it can also be based on what is coming in an email and a few other stuff. But then the main takeaway here for me is what the different types of actions you can actually trigger automatically, which is something simple as assignment which is going to be automatically delegating emails. But it also could be adding a tag or sending a reply. This add conversation to a remove conversation is what I was talking to Andrea about earlier which is being able to remove it from yours and adding it to finance easily. So there's a lot that we can do.

Jessica Di Duro (jessica.diduro@myserenitykids.com):
  Yeah, sounds good.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Based on what we've matt and I've walked you through today. Does this seem like something that could add some value? Because we were particularly confident because we've seen this story before and we've seen that it can really help you cut down a lot of additional steps in your day to day. But what we want to get some feedback from y'all.

Andrea Fazio (andrea@myserenitykids.com):
  yeah, I think it's definitely, it could be very applicable for how we're functioning now. And I think it can help us scale because we're going to be adding more team members. We're going to be changing up current processes of our team members potentially. And this might help us kind of streamline and define how we can scale the team and reduce redundancies, reduce these emails back and forth. Like when we receive something like Lindsey said, everybody emails me and says they're done. And like I don't need all those extra emails.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yep. I agree.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, I know we're coming up here on time so we can email all this to you as well. And then as far as next steps go here, we do offer a free seven day trial where we can connect a mailbox set up some of these flows and test it out with some of the, some of your team members. Would you guys be open to that?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Yeah. Let us discuss a little bit how kind of the approach we want to go. I guess from my perspective, I'd like to get it set up at least, so everybody has visibility and we're like filing stuff and then maybe we can kind of do phase two with like the rules and the drafts and all of that. But let us discuss a little bit and kind of figure that out, but I think we're pretty close to moving forward for sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Absolutely. And this would be for around 10 people, right? Lindsay?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Yeah, yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  It, it was in five. It was in chunks of five, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. Yeah. And if you have, because if you have 10, if you sign up with 10 people, you actually get onboarding as well. So you'll have a dedicated onboarder here at hiver and they'll actually help you with setting up the account and training everybody as well too. So that's the other option as well.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay. That's good to know. Yeah, we'll be right. I think we'll have like eight or nine people, but I think we'll initially sign up with the 10. That sounds good. Would definitely need some onboarding support for sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Well, you'll get it. And we also have 24 seven support as well. Chat phone, you can even set up more calls, reach out to them. If you, if you look at the online G2 reviews for hiver, you know, a lot of our raving reviews is specifically about our support, but yeah, I know you need some time here. Will we be able to put something in the calendar, maybe a follow up next week? Would that be all right?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Yep, that's fine.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And what time is it? You're in Texas, right?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Yeah, I'm in Arizona, so, I'm currently.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I know the timing's confusing. Now, the timing, the changes. Okay? You're in Mountain Time? Okay. Well, we can keep it's almost.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Noon here. I think I'm Mountain Time now.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. I, could you want to, can we do this meeting, maybe Monday at five, just an hour later than what we had originally? So it'd be 11 a M… PST for… Monday? Let me see. Let me make sure actually.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Let's do, can you do Friday the fourteenth? Is that an option?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we could do Friday the fourteenth. I, can you want to do it at the same time as today on the fourteenth? I can do that. Okay. Yeah.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  That'd be great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Yeah, we'll do that. I'll email everything to you. Was there anything else that you needed information from us, you think, or?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  I don't do you guys feel like you have everything Andrea, Jesse? Did I answer all your questions… somewhat?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, I feel good. Okay. Great. Well, really appreciate everyone's. Time. I'll send an invite. I'll send a recap email with some resources here. Feel free to I'll include Jeevan on the email too. So feel free to reach out to us if any questions thoughts come up in the meantime. Otherwise, we'll talk again on the fourteenth.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Thank you. Appreciate it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Thanks, everyone. Bye bye.
