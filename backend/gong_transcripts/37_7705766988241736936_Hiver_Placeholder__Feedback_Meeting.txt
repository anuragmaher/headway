Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hello? Hey, hi, Mike, Manoj.

Mike:
  Here. How are you? Hi. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good man. Good. Thanks for asking. I'm just waiting on Rakesh. Just give me a minute.

Mike:
  Yeah, no problem.

Mike:
  Yeah, Rakesh is also killed.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi, Rakesh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi, Manoj. Hi Mike. Hello?

Mike:
  Hi. How's it going? Good?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you. I mean, apologies, I had a quick phone call from one of my customers and I couldn't just disconnect so.

Mike:
  No problem at all. So… you probably want to hear what's on the feedback on everything. So… I have problems on our side, not on your side.

Mike:
  The problem with inboxes. So, because hiver works with Gmail accounts and the two main inboxes that we want to connect to. It are actually aliases to like I said to you, I think in the last meeting, my boss and then another employee in here, so we were not able to connect them because we need to create separate Gmail or G suite accounts for those inboxes. And then we need to do all kinds of routing and make sure that our production server can continue sending emails after we make these changes. So, for that reason, we were not able to connect the two inboxes yet, but we are hoping to do this by end of today or maybe tomorrow. Okay? So I only invited only a handful of people from the company to just play around with the demo inbox, but I haven't invited more of them because we actually need to connect the real inboxes to actually allow them to use it properly to test? So for this reason, I was going to ask you, would it be possible to extend this trial to let's say Friday next week?

Mike:
  So it would be the sixth of February because at the moment, there's nobody testing it because there's no inboxes to test with.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Yeah, I'm looking at it and I'm going to be extending it right after this, if you could just, yeah. Okay. I've already extended it for a couple of more days for next week. It is now active until the eighth of February.

Mike:
  Okay. Oh, is it? Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's great. Yeah, that's plenty of time. Yeah. All right. That is plenty of time. Yeah, I played around with it with the demo inbox and everyone seems to like it. It would be just a case of teaching everyone how to use it. Not everyone is that great at computers. Some people are great. Some people are not. So that would be my challenge here, but overall, we see potential of it. Yeah, at the start, I think we would go off with the growth plan just for the two inboxes. And then if we need more inboxes then obviously, I think it's the next plan. Is it because the next plan, the pro or whatever it is, that one is the 65? Is it 65 dollars?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's right. Yeah, pricing is something we can always discuss. Mike. I don't think it's going to be a barrier for us. We are open to discuss it. The most important part is as long as your team likes it and it solves the problems because I see Barry and Anastasia, you have already invited into the account haven't yet accepted it. So you might just want to check in case they are finding any problems with regards to the team trainings. We have got everything sorted. We have the training program in place. We don't charge anything extra for the onboarding and training. It's just that we want to make sure that, hey, they are also a part of hiver testing. And before that, like you said, very valid, you connect to your real inboxes so that everybody has like a fair understanding of where do we stand? How we use hiver in everyday basis? So, happy to assist you with any way possible and maybe we.

Mike:
  can just,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  regroup somewhat next week if that's okay. Maybe. Yeah.

Mike:
  So, I think maybe Thursday next week will be a good time sure, because then we will have some testing behind us. And then if I have any other questions, I can present them to you. Yeah, absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  How about the same timing? If that's okay?

Mike:
  Yeah, that's perfectly fine. Yeah, Thursday mornings, same time is fine with me?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely sent you an invite for Thursday. Let's regroup. And maybe if you have a couple of, I mean, if you have questions from the team as well, feel free to bring them on to the meeting, we can take all of their questions anyways, your trial is already extended.

Mike:
  Thank you very much appreciate it have.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Them, thank you. Yeah, have them invite to the hiver account, play around with the system and then we can take all of your questions. And again, like I said, pricing should not be a concern if you require a higher tier plan to begin with, but budgetary constraints are there. I want to make sure if hiver is a good choice of your tool for you, we can always make, I mean, the pricing work for you guys. Yeah.

Mike:
  Because we're only like an SME, let's say with maybe 20 maximum of 20 employees. So our budgets are not massive. So 65 per month per user, times whatever 10 users or something like that. That's quite a bill because the G suite at the moment I think is about 450 or 500 euros a month. So that basically doubles it… if we can come to some agreement on the price that'd be great, but that's not.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That should be okay. And I'm sure. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure CEO at your company would be able to tell us, okay, what the budgets are. And yeah, even if we happen to go to that stage, be assured, have my word, we are flexible to look at it.

Mike:
  That's great. Yeah. So, yeah, I think that's really all I have as an update. So, yeah, we will just connect the inboxes today or tomorrow and then we'll start testing the next weekend.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. All right. Should you have any more questions again? Just our email away from you? Feel free to write back. Otherwise we're going to be talking next week.

Mike:
  Yeah. Okay. Lovely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Mike. Thank you for your time.

Mike:
  Thank you guys. Thank you. Thanks.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Bye, bye bye.
