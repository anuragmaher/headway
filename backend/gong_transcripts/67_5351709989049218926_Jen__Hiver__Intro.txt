Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Jen. This is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Jennifer Smith (jen.smith@busykid.com):
  Hi there, matt. Yes, I can.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. I'm so sorry about being late here. Of course, my other meeting was just running over, no worries, but I'm glad you were able to make it. Give me one second here. I'm just going to pull your information up real quick. But, yeah, Jen, if you want to, tell me a little bit… here. Awesome. Okay. Got it. Did you, we reached out to you?

Jennifer Smith (jen.smith@busykid.com):
  Yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. So, yeah, agenda for the call here, Jen just wanted to spend the first couple of minutes learning a little bit more about you, maybe anything that was top of mind that interested you in taking this meeting today?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I don't expect you to know much about hiver. We're essentially a help desk platform. And then from there, I can tell you about our company and walk through the platform. Does that sound good?

Jennifer Smith (jen.smith@busykid.com):
  Could you actually tell me a little bit more about hiver first?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we're a AI SaaS platform help desk platform. So we help our main thing that we help companies with is we help companies manage shared email addresses. So think like support at marketing, at info, at billing, at accounting, at, does your company use any kind of shared email addresses that are kind of used amongst the team or we?

Jennifer Smith (jen.smith@busykid.com):
  Only really have two shared and one does not have volume that would be of concern. And the other one, we do have an AI system already integrated into.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. What's that system?

Jennifer Smith (jen.smith@busykid.com):
  Zendesk?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. You're using Zendesk? Okay. Got it. So, yeah, I mean, we would be, we're a direct replacement for Zendesk. You know, the, some of the main reasons people come over to us to, from Zendesk is they just find it kind of clunky, hard to use, could be expensive just depending on what you're paying for. And basically, yeah, they're just looking for kind of an easier to use more flexible system when it comes to ticketing, are you, do you any of that resonate with you with your Zendesk or?

Jennifer Smith (jen.smith@busykid.com):
  So, unfortunately, we actually built out cause we have a dev team. So we built out quite a sophisticated build out with Zendesk and we're pretty happy with that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And let me… see here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, okay, you guys, Zendesk, how about chat? Are you using anything for chat? Yeah, I.

Jennifer Smith (jen.smith@busykid.com):
  would not be the one to talk to you about this, but we are, we have the AI integrated on the chat as well. And that was also something we used our dev team to build out. So it is, it would not be something we'd be looking to replace anything with an alternative cause that would be a heavier lift. And we've got it built out to a point now where we're quite happy with it. So, I don't think hiver would be a good fit for us. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I don't either, but really appreciate your time. Thank you so much for coming on the call and giving us a chance. Appreciate it if anything changes, let us know.

Jennifer Smith (jen.smith@busykid.com):
  Awesome. Thanks so much, Matthew. I appreciate it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks.
