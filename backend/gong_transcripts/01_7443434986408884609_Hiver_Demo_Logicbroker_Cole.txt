  I'm good. How are you? Good?

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  cool. Okay. So they skip me past those bdrs huh?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. You know, I've always been a fan of that as well, just kind of, I feel like most people when they hop on calls like these, they'd rather, you know, see product and kind of hop into the nitty gritty versus, you know, two steps to reach that point. So, I'm a big fan of that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Nice. Yeah, I love Boston. I was just in what's the area where they shoot the movie the town in that like tight little area.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  Charlestown or South Boston.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think that's where I was, yeah, cool. Yeah, that's a cool area.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  Anyway, so you've got 15 minutes. Well, actually only 11 now, but tell me a little bit about hiver. I think I've come across you guys a little bit. I'm happy to talk a little bit about logicbroker and my role, whatever you want to start with.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So would love to just understand Eric from your perspective as, you know, senior director of client success, kind of how you're operating today, the tools that you're leveraging to provide support, we can kind of start there. Then I can kind of work in like, you know, where hiver and where that might come into play. Yeah.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  So I run our client success and account management teams globally. So I have a team in North America and a team in Europe. We acquired a european company late last year. So we're just sort of in the integration there. Obviously, I do have a peer who runs support, but we report out to our customer officers. So it's the same org. So we are on Zendesk now, but likely transitioning to the support model within Hubspot. We're big Hubspot users for CRM. And the company we're acquired is also on Hubspot. And so we are most likely going from Zendesk to Hubspot at some point later this year. So hopefully that answers your question. We also use some bits and pieces of Monday com and Asana for more from like an internal project management perspective.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So you're using Zendesk service today for your like ticketing and then you're going to bring everything to the Hubspot, you know, service hub that's going to be like your transition because you're using that for marketing and sales as well, correct? Correct?

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  Yeah, it's our CRM and marketing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So where kind of hiver like plays in how we help teams? Eric? You know, we do provide a CRM slash like email management tool to help teams manage those customer support and queries. So one use case of ours is like more of like a help desk where we provide chatbots, email management, whatsapp, we integrate with voice providers, you know, offer internal external knowledge bases as well as a customer portal for kind of engaging with your customers, tracking those tickets and interactions. Okay? And then another use case of ours can be more dedicated for customer success teams who are providing a scaled success model for incoming queries and tickets. Got it. So you said there's is there just one person on the customer support team today who's kind of managing the tickets as they come in?

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  No, no, we've got a whole, we have a whole team both in the US and the U. K. We've got like three, three or four in the US and two in the UK.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Three or four in the U. S, two in the U. K, and they're all working out of Zendesk today, managing those incoming queries and tickets, and how are customers today? Submitting those? Like how, what is your intake process? Yeah.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  We have like a support at logicbroker email address, which is the majority of how those are coming in.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, support at, and then you're kind of giving that around. Okay. Got it. And then in terms of your email provider, are you guys at Google workspace shop?

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  No, we're all Microsoft.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. All Microsoft shop, got it. Okay. Cause that's where we're going to come in, right? So we integrate, you know, with Microsoft, we have a read write integration into our platform to help manage that support at email address. And then we can integrate with tools, you know, like Hubspot to pull in like that CRM data to have the context on the right hand panel. So I can just share my screen to give you an idea here. So taking a look at my screen, right? You would log into this with your Microsoft sso and you'd have personal inbox communications up top and then the shared inbox, so that's support at email below. So for this example, let's just take a look at the sales inbox. So we break up the sub views beneath it to help manage the intake right there's. The mind section, everything that I'm working on unassigned new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be distributed. Okay? And then there's the overall team view. So understanding, you know, what is the team working on in real time across this mailbox, what's outstanding, and what needs to be completed. So complete visibility across the org and who's handling what… but going into the unassigned, right? When we click into, you know, these email communications, a tab on the right hand side is going to open up that's going to help us manage the emails, right? So we can delegate them out. In this case, I'll assign it to myself. Let the team know I'm going to follow up. We can track the status whether it's open pending or closed ensuring nothing slips between the cracks. And then add those tags for those analytical purposes to organize conversations as well as, you know, provide the analytics on the backend to see why are people reaching out to that email address? And, you know, what are we working through on a daily, weekly, monthly basis with our clients? And we keep the emails in their foundational form. Actually. Let me find a better example that's not like a… promotional email. Okay. Cool. So we also provide that collaborative aspect as well being able to collaborate internally, you know, have those messages back and forth, you know, with team members to bring them into that conversation. And then we can streamline things with AI copilot as well to draft replies based on the data sources that your team is feeding it on the backend, whether it's processes documentation… however you want to, you know, streamline responses for us to quickly insert it into the draft. And then we keep it all in that foundational email format. So like we're not kind of like bringing things in like a type environment. We're keeping it foundational to how you operate out of email.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  And how does the customer view this like sort of in their inbox, sort of same thing? Very conversational?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it keeps it very conversational. They don't feel like they're in a ticket in another system like it's just like me and you communicating over email, got it. But want to pause here, Eric, what are your thoughts on this so far? What are you like?

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  Who are some of the clients that you work? I guess two things like who are some of your current clients? And like who are your, are you guys competing with Zendesk, the pylon, the Hubspot?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  Like, okay. So, exactly, what those? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we're competing against Zendesk pylon Hubspot front, some of those players in the space? And then we have a large, you know, we're pretty agnostic with who we can work with. We have like enterprise companies like capital one, flexport, who have, you know, thousands of users with us. And then we have, you know, mom and pop shops. Yeah. But where we really like thrive is our emailing capabilities because we keep it so foundational to how teams are operating today. And we don't make emails fit into that ticketing site functionality. We're just keeping it native to how it's functioning within Microsoft.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  Yeah. Interesting.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we're also, you know, comparative to Hubspot, we're very cost effective as well, but I know we are coming up at time here, Eric. Yeah. Is this, you know, relevant enough or interesting enough to like maybe do like a proof of concept or take this further? Like what are your thoughts on this so far? Yeah, I mean, listen.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  I'll be honest, right? Like support is a little bit outside my realm. We have someone who like runs the director of client experience and support. And as I mentioned earlier, I think with our upcoming, I think we've pretty much set in stone. I think in March or April to move from Zendesk to Hubspot, yeah. So I was, I thought it was more around like client. I didn't know it was like a one for one. I didn't know that hiver was like a one for one support or service desk. I thought it was some other like sort of experience or like client success management desk? Yeah, like.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  A gain site? Yeah, like a.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  Gain site or a turn zero or one of those. So that was my best. I would say two things. One, I'm not the primary user. Two, I'm pretty sure we're like 95 percent confirmed to move to Hubspot. Yeah. So I don't think it's the right time, but hey, by the way, I've got this other company trying to, you know, see if we can do that. I think that's been made because we're already on Hubspot. I think financially it makes sense for us just to add this module in versus having yet another like system, another tool, if that makes sense. Yeah, I'm just being honest with you. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, totally understand that. So, what I can do here is Eric, I'll just shoot you some information if you just maybe want to forward that along to the team, that would be awesome just so they have the information.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can do that. And if it's something they want to, you know, evaluate further, we can, if not, you know, we can just, you know, part ways as friends as they say.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. You've got my email address. Any changes? I'll definitely. You know, I'll definitely let you know. Okay all.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right, perfect. No, I appreciate the time though, Eric. I will follow up with you after this with that info and I hope you have a great weekend.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  Cool. Thanks, Cole. Have a great one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Take care.

Eric Yale (eyale@logicbroker.com):
  Talk to you. Bye bye.
