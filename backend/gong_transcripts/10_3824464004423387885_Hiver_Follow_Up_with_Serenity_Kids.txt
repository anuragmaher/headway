Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Lindsey. How's it going?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Good. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Doing good, doing good.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Sorry, I'm running a little late today.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, no problem. Anything within five minutes is on time?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  That's so fair. That's true that's kind of how we operate too. It seems like.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, awesome. Well, yeah, just want to see if you had any updates. Obviously, I think that maybe some of your teammates were going to join this call or?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  No, it's just me, we're ready to roll. We're ready to move forward. So, I just wanted to talk through how that looks.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, I can just send you over a quote. Once you sign it, we'll issue you an invoice, and then I'll introduce you to your onboarding team, who will help with setting up your account.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, before I do that, I just want to… what was I going to say? Just want to solidify the options, right? So, we were talking about 10 users, right on pro. Yeah, awesome. And did you want the AI add on as well?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  How much is that? Can you remind me?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'll show you the site here.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Maybe just pull that up, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. So, we got the base package, 45 dollars per user per month billed annually. And then the only add on we have is the AI and it includes all of our AI features, and it also includes the AI features that we have coming out soon as well.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Let's do the AI. Why not? Sounds good?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. And would you be the one who's signing the quote?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, I will send you over a quote for the seats and the AI. And then, yeah, once you sign it, like I said, we'll issue you an invoice and I'll send you an email introducing you to your team. You should be able to schedule your first onboarding call, probably early next week. Would that work for you?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Yeah, that should work. I'd like to kind of go live with it, if that makes sense December first, if that's possible. Otherwise we can push that back if that's not possible.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I think if the team's available, Lindsay, I'm here just to like I was here to answer questions, matt can help you with the billing stuff. So I'll probably be coordinating efforts with our success and implementations team as well, just to make sure you're up and running, we can 100 percent get you up and running by December first. If you all have the time and it's not even such a big lift given that it is in terms of integrations and everything, we're a Google partner.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So that takes about five minutes. It's very plug and play. So once you've signed it, you get that back to us. We'd love to sort of like get you started as quickly as possible so that we have time going into December first. Do you have a time next week? That way we can just maybe schedule some tentative time and answer any questions. And if everything is lined up by then we'll introduce you to our implementations team then?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I have a lot of time next week actually. Could we do Monday?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We can do Monday?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Around the same time or maybe earlier or later actually.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  If we could do actually the same time would be great. That'd be perfect.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I can do, I was just going to say just the same time. I have another, I have a conflict 30 minutes later, 30 minutes earlier, either work.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  What time zone are you on?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Matt's in pacific, I'm in India, but I work eastern hours. Oh, okay. Yeah. So we can be flexible. So I've.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  got, maybe I can shoot you sometimes, I have like a couple sporadic meetings that day, but if it works nine central. So that would be 11 eastern.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  11, nine central. Would that be 11 eastern? Or is that 10 eastern wait?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  What am I right now? I'm nine mountain right now. I don't know, I can shoot you sometimes, if that helps. But, I have a pretty free schedule on Monday. I just have like three conflicts, so.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. So just to make things easier, I'll send over an invite for nine mountain if I heard that correct? Yeah, nine.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Mountain? Yeah, if you're real?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. We do this all the time. So nine mountain, I'll send it over and if we've got everything lined up by then I hope to make introductions and sort of plan out what we've got for onboarding over the next few days.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  That's fantastic. Great. The only last thing is I have to get you guys set up financially. So, matt, are you the right person to do that? I?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Can take that. I can take that. Lindsay, no worries. Okay?

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  All right. I'll just send, we used to palty, so I'll just send an email and copy you in with our finance team. There's. Like a form we fill out or whatever, but, easy, we.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Do that for a few of our other clients already so familiar with the platform. So, yeah, we're already, I think partially set up. So it should be easy.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Fantastic.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, if you just want to put both of us on that email, Lindsay, Jeevan's, I just put Jeevan's email in the chat. He's also on the calendar invite too, you can grab it there.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, I will email you over a link to the quote. And then, yeah, once you sign it, that's when we can get a onboard or sign to your account. So the quicker we can get the signature, just the quicker we can get you up and running here to get you live by December first.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Fantastic. Okay. Sounds good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Lindsay. Well, we really appreciate it. We're excited about working with you and yeah, we'll communicate here through email and if you have any other questions, let us know.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Okay. Thank you guys. Sounds good. Have a great weekend.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks, Lindsay. Bye.

Lindsey Krueger (lindsey@myserenitykids.com):
  Take care.
