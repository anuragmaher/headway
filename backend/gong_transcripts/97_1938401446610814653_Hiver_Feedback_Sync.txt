Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hi, Erin. Good morning.

EXACT Sports:
  Good morning. How are you doing? My manager, Sam should be joining us shortly. I chit chatted with him a bit back once we set up this call just to let him know. I looked at from sort of any inbox management tool from my perspective and like my inbox specialist perspective of like ease and efficiency and whatnot. And rightfully, so he comes at it from the angle of like… you know, sort of from a management perspective as well as whatever. So hopefully he comes in and asks some good questions as well, but I shared all those materials with him so he can look at those. And then, yeah, I think we've got another demo later… so that can hopefully, but yeah, thanks for sharing everything over though because that was literally exactly what I was looking for.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. Thank you so very much. I'm glad to be of help. And I see Sam has already joined in. Nice to meet you, Sam.

Sammorgan:
  Nice to meet you as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Now, I met Erin last time around. Let me quickly introduce myself since this is the very first time I'm catching up with you. My name is Rakesh. And I take care of sales at hiver. I've been with the company for over four years, have personally onboarded beyond 500 teams.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So I'll be the point of contact to run the show today. We discussed last time around that we're looking at management of directors at the rate shared inbox amongst four or five people. I'm sure you and Erin had a chat internally, but I'm open to all your questions. How can I help you, sir?

Sammorgan:
  Okay. Yeah, I'm just listening and as questions come up, I'm sure I will have some, and I will let you know.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Does that mean that you want me to take you through a quick product walkthrough since we did that already, or did you get a chance to look at the quick recording of our older conversation? Happy to do either ways?

Sammorgan:
  Yeah, you could do a quick walkthrough. I did not look at the recording. I have not seen that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. Let me quickly do that for you now. I'm not going to be asking you questions from an operational standpoint. Of course, Erin and I did go through all of that. How email management could work literally right inside Gmail inboxes. There is a clear visibility ownership of these emails when you assign and reassign these tickets. But from the management standpoint when you are looking at from above 30,000 feet, what is it that the main thing that you would like to do? I mean from a reporting standpoint or strategic decision making, how do you want a system to assist you with? And I'll definitely route all the conversations accordingly.

EXACT Sports:
  I can, I think I can answer that question or Sam you want to?

Sammorgan:
  No, no, no, you go.

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah. I think another thing we've been trying to do is not only for our inbox to be as efficient as possible and in terms of people email, and we are nearly immediately responding and they can feel like because that's something we've heard in the inbox is people do feel like emails are people are a 1,000 Miles away, like they're sending an email into a void and we don't get back to them not only making that conversion of you email, we email back very quickly, but also in terms of sales. And in terms of that's where a lot of our marketing push comes from emails. So we have a lot of invitations. We have a lot of reminders, we have things about our events, about things that you can sign up for pre registering. So we were going to see if there's any, not only the ticketing system. And I think obviously, I think also Sam would want to know a little bit more about the AI automation tools. We're always looking to automate and make things more efficient for both ourselves and for our specialists. But in terms of if we were to send you an email inviting you to one of our events, and then you look at the email and go, that's interesting. And you email us back. If there's a way we can track who's responding to what emails, what's getting the most, what's scratching the most, and what people are more interested in. And then maybe if there is, this might be a little bit also more niche to us. But say you emailed back and we respond and you go well, what a great answer. I'm going to I'm going to sign up for this camp. Would there be ways of tracking conversion? Tracking sales and seeing? So we can better streamline our communications outbound and get everything as efficient as possible.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. I hear you thoroughly now. There's a slight difference here and let me be very open and fair here, Erin, you're asked in specific to running an outbound campaign from marketing standpoint, getting traction out of that communication, try and see what campaign is actually working out well and where you're entering the people's interest, and you are getting those, you know, forms filled in and all of those registrations is actually a part of CRM or probably a solution which could help you. Do, you know, the outbound campaigning hiver is supposed to is a solution to manage customer inquiries which are predominantly the incoming. Now, for an example, your marketing team is doing an absolute fabulous job of running and campaign where you're getting to traction as long as these emails have been reverted on to directors at the rate email address, or even if these emails have been routed to a specific inbox that can be set up and managed in hiver. That's when we come into play, where, yeah, you have all the incoming requests coming in, I can help you filter out the ones which are warm requests, the ones which are about registration signups versus the ones which are probably fyi emails or, you know, just notifications or general emails, where as a sales teams, we probably do not even need to put on our brainstorming. So we are not a CRM to be fair. Neither, we are a solution that would help you run the outbound campaigning. So, my specialization as a tool would be predominantly in management of incoming emails, making sure nothing slips through the cracks, helping, you know, triage those emails, better route this email to the right representative, having to have a quick response to those emails. And for Sam, we can tell Sam, these are the registration requests versus the sales request versus the generic emails. Now, on top of it, how soon are we responding to those emails? Is there any customer satisfaction we can run on top of it? Is there an AI agent that can help you draft responses where we are still saving a lot of operational bandwidth, a scalable solution to respond to those emails, tag those emails, automatically look at the response times. All of that is a typical way to manage customer support, I would say, or sales communication support from inbound standpoint?

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah. I, yeah, I wouldn't I can't imagine if I tried to go over to the marketing team and tell them, what, which one of their outbound emails are working. So, yeah, I completely understand the difference between sort of outbound and yeah, I think just once they're in back into my inbox, like once hook line sinker, we got them in the inbox, there are ways we can track that and track if how.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  people?

EXACT Sports:
  You mentioned customer like satisfaction? Would that be something where it's you know, blatant? We just ask how is your, you know, sort of a scale of one to five or like a bunch of, or would that be something where it beats the tone of the emails and people are generally happy when they are emailing. And then when they get a response?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good observation actually in both ways, one is the general sentiment. If you look at these emails with the Smiley faces, these are the neutral emails, right? I mean, you've got neutral sentiments here. You see this because this is something customer is asking for. And then second thing is more to do with the actual reporting on customer analytics on, you know, satisfaction, which is something to do with a csat survey and rating where you're explicitly asking customers how many of them are satisfied, not happy. Okay. And then you're receiving email feedback and this would go something like I'm working on the emails coming into the support inbox. I'm picking this email up, looking at the conversation, replying to the customer email. The moment I'm actually closing this request. I'm actually going to go ahead and automatically sending a response with the customer satisfaction inserted to it. So this would be something like a quick csat survey and you could always change the draft here. Like you could ask, would you be recommending our product or services to somebody else in your near and dears? Or instead of smileys, you could just always say, ask, yes, no, maybe happy sad neutral. Something on those lines. All of that is customizations you could choose to send this?

Sammorgan:
  But do you track, do you track interactions with individual customers? Like if we want to see an individual customer history, is that something we could do or even export something like that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, absolutely. Now, all of these are going to be inside your analytics. If you are in specific, talking about a particular account or a customer, you go to the contacts, and these are going to be the contacts for you. For an example, this is xyz sports, this is planix. Digital. This is hiver, this is copper. So these are going to be your customers in question. If these are coming in from very specific domains.

Sammorgan:
  Yeah. But so, so we're B to C, not B to B so that, you know, ours would be the most active conversations would be at Gmail. Com, you know, understood.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Now, what essentially would you want to then track from these customers? If you could give me an idea?

Sammorgan:
  How many emails we got from Rakesh?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. You still go into the contacts, search for a specific contact. I would say under the contacts here, all of these are going to be your Gmail. Com, yahoo. Com and any customer in particular. And then you could search for it by the way this is, let's say, Rakesh, and in the date range for last 90 days, how many times he contacted, how many of them are new conversation result? And on an average, how long we've been taking as a team to respond to these emails. Now, not necessarily that every time Aaron is replying to Rakesh, if this has been replied by multiple folks in different occasions, you could have average response.

Sammorgan:
  Can you go back to the last screen real quick? Just so I could see?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. These are all the contacts. Yeah.

Sammorgan:
  And then scroll down performance. Yeah. And then can you export any of this?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. You customize this report. Look at a new report. Look at any of these variables where you're actually looking at a feedback summary, even, or new conversations or resolved conversations, select the date range, filter it by what exactly do you require out of these may not be everything, but, yeah. And then you've got further variables on these many parameters… and this can be exported in CSV and this could be a one time ad hoc export that you require or you could schedule a report like every end of the month, you want to export a report specifically with these variables?

Sammorgan:
  What about, could you import or bring in customer data?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  By default hiver works on Gmail as long as your customers are communicating and sending an email to directors at the rate or these have been generated on Google workspace. This by default is going to be actually your connects in hiver contact book here. So you don't have to import, this by default.

Sammorgan:
  I mean, like, when someone emails, does it show like customer info? Like if you open an email thread?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Now, this would actually go into, so, okay, let me take a step back and take you to scratch zero. I know this is the very first time you're catching up. Now, every individual who's going to be working on directors and box would log into their individual Gmail accounts. Hiver works on individual gmails. Now, once we are inside our own logins, we need to simply install hiver extension, run the entire Gmail setup. I have personal emails on my top inbox. These are private to myself. I'm not sharing these emails with anybody at the same time. I've got a shared inbox set up with directors at the rate email address, which is where you would have all the director emails coming into this shared space.

Sammorgan:
  Sorry, just to clarify. So this would mean that every freelancer would need to have their own company, Gmail company account, they need.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  To have individual logins, that is correct.

Sammorgan:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do they all share the password at this point in time? Like everybody log into directors inbox with a common password?

Sammorgan:
  Yeah. In fact, that was the original reason for this project was to have more that it would looking for something to add the layer of security. So we're not using a shared inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood, are you open to creating inboxes for these individuals and then have everybody log into their own gmails? And you let them manage the common inboxes from the space?

Sammorgan:
  It's a possibility, but it adds a cost.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Well, of course. Yes. But if you're looking at any of those emails, maybe perhaps one missed email, one missed customer, then we're not looking at a cost for sure. I mean, I understand where you're coming in from, but yeah, it does. It does incur a cost of adding individual logins because only then I'll be able to look at what my team is up to, how many emails have been assigned to, what different email folks in my team, right? I could literally see which email has been handled by which representatives. Now, in case Rakesh is working on seven emails, Yukta is on six emails. And if Yukta takes a day off, I could literally see her inbox, look at how many director emails she is working on, how many of them are absolutely needed? Like these are three billing for email inquiries about billing. Can I just simply go ahead and move those to somebody else who's available to work on it immediately? All of that is possible without forwarding these emails manually or I don't have to call Yukta, hey, you're away, but there's an important email. Even I can look at the email, look at what the context is, summarize the entire conversation with one click, look at what needs to be done and ask hiver AI to simply help me generate an email with respect to a draft reply. And this can be actually through the actual knowledge based sources. Like you could literally, so feed hiver with respect to what is the okay copilot. And then you have the knowledge sources, right? You could upload the documents, upload the different websites where you have frequently asked questions and hiver can help you draft these responses. Now. Unless we have individual logins, I don't have this visibility on who is working on what. And then people closing the conversations because they're done with the tasks. All of those actually move to the closed bucket.

EXACT Sports:
  If somebody were to, if one of our specialists were to respond to an email even though they have their own individual, if… they got their own individual login, yeah, add exact. Would it all still say that it's coming from the big inbox? Because, yeah, I wouldn't we wouldn't want those specialists to get one off emails from random people?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Other ways, even if they happen to choose an email, which is their personal email address, because this email has been routed through your director's inbox, it still does not matter. They would still receive email in the personal inbox, but the copy of it would be right there in the support for everybody's transparency. So that's the beauty even if I'm using by the way, the very first thing is to route all the emails by default from directors at the rate inbox at any given chance. If I happen to respond using my email address, anyways, you still have an access to look at the closed ones and look at the all conversations here.

EXACT Sports:
  Gotcha. And I saw, I know we just brought the co pilot. What would, right now, what we're operating out of is streak and we have snippets and stuff like that. So we do have faq pages and we do definitely have stuff that could feed the AI and then have it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's exactly the replica that we're going to be doing. I mean, you have uploaded all of those in streak in hiver, we'll be just uploading those documents. The urls and hiver will literally look at the co pilot, would literally read all of those documents. Look at any of those customer requests. When you ask hiver to generate a response, it would go ahead, recall the entire document, understand the context of your question or of your customer and then help you draft a response. Mind it? It would not send an email by default. It would still refer to a draft and your agent would actually have to, you know, yes, no, maybe and then send a response. We deliberately haven't been able to. I mean are not sending responses because we still require human touch, right? For a reason we exist.

Sammorgan:
  So, sorry, real quick. So it does that automatically, where it creates the draft?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It does, it creates the draft. You just need to prompt that, hey, we require a draft on it. And if these are the templates for an example, let me take you through this use case. Let's say I open this one up, customer is asking for additional 15 licenses or 15 registrations. Now, if we receive these kind of emails, so much hiver is going to be prompting you a quick template which is the most relevant and used template because these are the fashion of emails we've been getting in the past also.

Sammorgan:
  But I guess to Aaron's question, do you know what streak is a plugin that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I know. Would it?

Sammorgan:
  Work with this?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Streak and hiver does have a little bit of conflict in the past. I would want to just quickly cross check with my support team if this still happens to be because they both sit on top of Gmail. So I would like to check that. I guess, I mean it has been the case in the past, the systems were actually conflicting with each other. I believe you use streak for the CRM purposes?

Sammorgan:
  No, for snippets that's what Aaron was saying for snippets.

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah. So like if somebody were to email us and say I can't come to camp today, can I get my credit? We have all our agents would have to do is type in whatever the code is, and then Bam the whole paragraph of how to go online and receive your credit and obviously for them to self or get their credits on their own end. But yeah, it just sort of the idea would be like our specialists sort of have a encyclopedic knowledge of the snippet library. So that when an email comes in, there's a pretty much a 99 percent chance. We've already got all the messaging. I think my also concern which maybe just might be me as a, you know, nervous about outbound emails and consistent messaging would be like the thing about streak is it's word for word, what we want to tell people and then obviously edits can be made. But the explicit messaging and wording and all of that, you know, I want to make sure it's completely on the same page which I know, you know, if we were to input all of that into the AI, it would do the same thing. Or if we would have those suggested responses, it would do the same thing. But I think that's the security that streak brings us that it's word for word and every single thing that's in the snippet library. You know, there's no misinterpretation, we've kind of like mastered all the snippets so that they, you know, all of it's but there is inefficiencies to it as well. Where sometimes the snippets aren't just right, which is where the AI being a little bit more flexible would come in and help.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. But all in all you were saying, you're happy with what your streak has to offer today with the snippets because it is still helping you generate word on word, you know, like to the point answers to these repetitive questions.

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah, I think, yeah, if there's a possibility for you to run this, if you haven't seen this particular streak… as a particular CRM, you know, if you're able to run that by your product team just so that they can see it. Because if you've never seen it before, obviously that's no worries. But just to see how this can be implemented to hiver, and then B how it could even if we're not explicitly using this, how we could get sort of our library of snippets into hiver. And then whatever process that like just sort of that would just be onboarding.

Sammorgan:
  I think we ideally would like to use the AI response generator but I think the big that would be theoretically an upgrade over streak. But my, the thing I'm thinking about that I'm not really sure.

Sammorgan:
  I'm not really sure that we have that you would have a way to answer this. So I was hesitant on whether to ask it which is I've used various AI customer service response tools. And the problem I've seen is that… we, if we include all of our knowledge base, then the AI tool doesn't know, it gets confused about, you know, this one snippet that's used in rare circumstances, it will pull that information and give wrong answers or it will, it doesn't do a good job of… knowing basically rules of when some snippets apply and when other snippets apply. And I don't know how we'd be able to really see that without using it and that would involve the whole setup and all that. So it's like you kind of want to avoid. So I think that's why the snippets are important because, you know, you don't want to set up this whole infrastructure and then find out, oh, you know, bummer, it doesn't work or it doesn't work the way that we need it. And so we still need snippets. But now we can't use snippets. So it's like the snippets are really just sort of a fail safe, so that if the AI tool doesn't work as well as promised then, you know, we still have that backup… system.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that makes sense. Sam. And that's a very, you know, valid observation. I completely agree. I would only want to tell you that with hiver, not only the AI but our system mechanism, the algorithm runs on the machine learning as well, which is more like as long as you're dealing with certain specific or use cases, hiver, AI is definitely referring to the knowledge based articles and helping you draft responses. But when these responses are being sent by these agents, these are well learned by the system that this was the kind of verbiage we used in the past. And if these kind of emails do come in again, hiver automatically helps you generate the similar level of answers if not exactly the same. But I have not yet heard back from any customer that says it fails to respond appropriately because this time the customer was not asking for a refund but he was referring to the refund in the past. So I get what you're saying that there could be a miscommunication, there could be, for the same reason we are not sending out these emails automatically, right? We are helping you generate that. And hiver is actually learning the context. So we call it contextual draft of responses, hiver AI, along with the machine learning.

Sammorgan:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I mean, should you want, what I can do is maybe send you a detailed information on AI, help you go through that one more time and probably see if this is something that is in line with what you're looking at. But at the same time, I myself would like to check internally with my support team. If the streak snippets are going to be any conflict with hiver, then probably we are again into a point zero. And then, you know, it may not really make any sense because you've been using streak for quite some time. You've got snippets right there that is right on top of your Gmail. I don't want you to interrupt the existing workflow which is working. Absolutely. Okay. I mean, we are rather looking to solve problems to manage emails for director's inbox, not to create more trouble on top of it.

Sammorgan:
  Okay. Yeah. I mean, streak is a Gmail, a Google, it's a plugin, it's an email plugin. So I think, yeah, you check on that, and why don't, you tell us about the packages you offer?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure.

Sammorgan:
  Unless Erin, you have any other questions?

EXACT Sports:
  No, yeah, that's all I had, but in the same thing streak, also, we do run into that issue too where sometimes streak can be a bit rigid as in, you know, it's sort of this is the answer that we give out which also can be not right. But yeah, I would be curious to see what your internal team and yeah, like is the juice worth the squeeze? Is it worth like inputting all of the snippets which is quite a few we've got like a full library. But yes, I think if Sam wants to see the packages, that would be perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. I'm just going on off video for a quick second. My machine is actually running out of power. So I wanted to just go nearby a charging port. Unfortunately, the current one did not work. Apologies. But, yeah. Okay. Now we're going to be looking at the different packages. So we, okay. Let me just share my screen one more time.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right guys. Do you see my Gmail? Do you see my screen again? Yes. All right. Now, we've got these packages. The basic one is growth starting at 25 per login. Pro is more like advanced functionalities, email exports schedules, then you have customer service surveys, and then elite, basically when you require different sort of skill based routing, you need individual inboxes, email management, move to the shared inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I don't think, this is a relevant for one. I mean this is more of an overkill, but definitely this one, if you're looking at advanced reporting and analytics to be downloaded. Now, on top of it, we have got AI which is 20 dollars on top of per login. So essentially, it's going to be around 45 plus 20, around 65 dollars per login.

EXACT Sports:
  Gotcha. And you say, yep. So per login would be, we would, those would be the individual emails that we would make, and then per individual email.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's right? So that's going to be five individual logins that we're creating in Google workspace. And then on top of it, this is going to be 45 multiplied by five. And then we have got 20 per login also for AI. So essentially 65 per login multiplied by number of users.

EXACT Sports:
  And this all this?

Sammorgan:
  Wait, sorry, why was it 65, 20 dollars per user for AI?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That is right.

EXACT Sports:
  And all of this is AI.

Sammorgan:
  Answers and tasks. Instead, it's coming soon.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, this one already is in beta phase for our customers who are testing. I could go ahead and at the back and enable that for you, AI answers is coming up. Suggested response is already there summarizing compose emails, tagging sentiments. All of that is already out.

Sammorgan:
  And sorry, the answer, is that the, is that what you talked about with making a draft?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That is correct. No, that's not that's AI answers are more like instantly answering questions which are repetitive in nature. That's that's a suggested response. Actually. Sorry, the extracts where, you know, you've got okay, let me take you to the actual account, the admin setup that'll give you a more clear idea. Okay? Now that's AI, but the.

Sammorgan:
  suggested the suggested response is that part is in beta phase.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Exactly. That's. Like somebody asking for, how do I reset my password? I know this is a hard and fast question. Everybody's going to be asking the same way or some other way, but it's exactly the same question, right? So that's like you have AI suggested response to it. How do I enroll for a Bam membership? How do I cancel it? So those are going to be those, you know, specific standardized questions.

EXACT Sports:
  Gotcha. All right. Perfect. I think, yeah. And Sam, unless you have any other questions about this, I think all of this is available in the email you shared, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's right? I'll share more information on AI and we'll talk to my team internally about hiver and streaks compatibility for you guys.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect.

Sammorgan:
  Yeah. One other question, does everyone at the company, does everyone in that company… Google business workspace, have to be a member? Or only some of the only the ones who are using that inbox tool?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  In your Google workspace, you can probably have yourself as the member and just simply add the rest of the team. You don't have to give them the access with hiver setup. Once we are going to be setting it up in hiver, you can be the administrator and the rest of the team still is able to share the directors at the right inbox. I understand the security concerns. If you do not want to give them the access to the mailbox in Google workspace, you can absolutely choose to just add them as users and not to share, the common inbox.

Sammorgan:
  Got it. Okay. Sorry, Erin, you go ahead.

EXACT Sports:
  No, that's all I had.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. All right. Allow me with another day's time. Let me go ahead and talk to my product and my support team and send you an email about that. And in the meanwhile, should you come across any more questions, Erin, you've got my email account already. Feel free to write back to me and we'll be in touch towards the end of this week.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect. Yeah, yeah, I'll definitely be in touch and I'll let you know if I have, any other questions?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. All right, Sam and Erin, thank you for your time, guys. And yeah, we'll be in touch again. Let me just go ahead and check this internally and get back.

EXACT Sports:
  Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. You take care, guys. Goodbye.

EXACT Sports:
  Bye.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Bye.
