Another tool outside of workspace. Pull as much as Google ecosystem. Having to route all support emails and assign and sort them is work. Looking at ways to get analytics within Gmail . Goal is the find ways of finding 18 team members, unread/emails/person. Gmail is completely dark. If someone is OOO, there’s no way of figuring who’s responsible for what. Use Hiver to replace Zendesk. Support@ rentor SM, assign and FUP on emails. Analytics on Individual Gmail Explore the possibility of Zendesk replacement Permalinks He's currently paying $19/user with ZD. Contract renews in May 2024. Has been using Zendesk for the last 7 years. Likes the fact that Hiver brings everything within Gmail. Wants to give Hiver a try before deciding. Helped him sign up for a trial so he can test it. He's keen in getting the EOY discounts if all goes well. Will have an update by tomorrow."
