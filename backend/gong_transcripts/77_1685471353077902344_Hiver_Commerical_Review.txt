Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  hey, Roger.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Hey, hey, Alex, I'm… just coming in hot.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, sounds like you're running back to back.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Yeah, yeah. It's kind of like that today. Yeah. Oh, yeah. There we go.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Okay. Cool. Right on, man. All right. So, this is the commercial review. Okay, cool. Let's… let's do that. So… someone else joining Maria is here… and it's possible I'll be here too. So, yep.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Right on. Perfect. So yesterday we had discussed starting with five or six licenses would five be possible?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Yeah. So something that we ran into yesterday, that was a really big deal. Alex is nobody can draft anything. So, if Maria drafts an email to follow up with a client or something like that, nobody can see it.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Is this a reply to an existing email? No?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  That's the thing. It's like a, because this is not just passive, right? This is like, a constant back and forth between clients. So once the project is active then, they basically use this email to make sure it goes straight to the team. And then that way managers can see myself ironically also Maria, and then Arnold, can see it and interact with them and lots of times. And we're always coaching the rest of the team on communication. And so until some future timeframe when everybody is perfect… need to be able to make sure that we're we have oversight onto emails that are sending out. And I was very confused. I was talking to the hive person and I was very confused. They said we'll send that in as a feature request and I was just like baffled that this was unique because I'm like shared inbox, I would just think it would default to shared state, And, I think there was a little bit of an assumption that I was talking about the Gmail one after we talked, because of the history there. So I immediately said, hey, just, you know, I'm talking about the Omni one because I understood just based on our conversations, the kinds of limitations that we were talking about. And I was like, yeah, no, this is definitely something that we need to have in Omni. And so they're like we'll put that in there and I'm, like it's a huge chunk of the value prop, is the ability for having oversight. Otherwise, we might as well just have that email and then everybody just has the ability to log in. And then, you know, that person creates a draft and just slacks… and then we just go in, read the email and then it goes out and we can all log into that email and see it. But we're trying to avoid that complexity. But that's the control that we need to have. And why we wanted to go, why we want to go to this kind of product is because that's the perception that we thought we'd have, which is that level of control which is emails are coming in. We're tagging them, we're making sure it's all organized, and, you know, all the flight paths are communicated. And then communication is supervised. So we do it's.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  being built, which is like the worst thing to say. But yeah, the shared draft.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  The worst thing to say is we'll put it on a feature list. I have lots of features on products that never get built. So, no, no, that was definitely a lot better than the worst case scenario. Yeah. So, but no, it's under active development right now, like somebody is tasked with launching this feature. Is that what you're saying?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  I just want to get clear on the fuzziness of it's being built.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Because I am asking for clarity right now.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  All right. Happy to wait till the answer.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. I'm.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  happy to wait for that answer. Maria, I'm right, right. Like this is a huge chunk of our expectations, right? Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, yeah. And.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So this is just drafting up a net new communication for existing conversations. There is a shared draft capability. Yes. Okay. By.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  The way the shared reply, very opaque, the Guy everybody was asking me, how do you share? How do you share? Like how do you even do it? If you just reply? Like, is there no way to share it? And the only reason I know it's missing one thing is because I asked support and they told me how to do it in a reply and I was just like, that seems very deeply… embedded but I don't know maybe we're unique in this level of sharing… but that, to have it behind a three dot like that seems very, and I think it's actually next to something that's actually scary. I think, let… me just look here. There was right next to the dots, I think was something that I was like, oof, right next to each other?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Let me just take a peek… and then,

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  save… yeah, this card, yeah.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Let's see something.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Okay. Yeah. No, that's okay. And then… yeah… sorry, I'm just going through my thought process from yesterday. Oh, the other thing was, is at the account level, can we set the font?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  That's something because like it's the default font I noticed was serif?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Which looks like the 19 nineties.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  We use the default Gmail font. I don't know what that one is, but it doesn't look like that. So I noticed it. I was like, wow, this looks very different like very old school, but that's not a, you know, on the deal breaker list. I'm just giving now that I'm giving you feedback, I might as well just not stop right there's. Just no incentive to cut the stick short. But, yeah, for us like really big deal, not being able to share drafts. And while that would be great if that feature needs to be there. Eventually, my suggestion is that the whole inbox should default to everything is transparent until it's not.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  So,

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  it's not on it's, not under development. It's just on the list. So it is worse. Okay?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Yeah. So… yeah. Okay. We'll have to circle back to it and try to decide which way is the most advantageous?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  how many new emails do we do versus how many replies, right? That's what it's going to come down to. If ultimately, we all agree that we're only going to send out a handful of emails a week that are actually new, like, you know, what's the real load then? Doesn't make sense to not proceed Doing a lot of emails that it makes sense. Then now, all of a sudden, we have two pathways and people are not using the tool that we're paying for and they're sometimes using it and tagging is inconsistent, you know what I mean?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. Yeah.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Yeah. Okay. All right. So, what are we looking for on the commercial side for this before we run? Because I know Maria's got to go in 11 minutes, me too. So, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, you know, month to month pricing. I think we kind of settled on you're closer to the pro feature set.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Right. Yeah. We want to try that during that period just because it makes sense for us to see everything, right? And then dial it back as needed.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah. So, kind of on the pro feature set if we were to do five licenses, you know, it's kind of the max I can go is 40 percent off, which would be about 50 dollars per user, which would be 225, 255 on a monthly basis.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Okay. So 15 dollars more than the? , pro. Yeah. Well, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  15 more dollars than the growth. Yeah.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Yeah, that's how I'm comparing it, right? Yeah. Okay. And then, so if we did that and then we would just go month to month for the next 90 days on that, and then circle back. Okay?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And if you decided to opt for annual, you can do that within the product and it's not going to update the discount. It's not going to change the, what I entered the system. So you, we have 40 licenses here. I was like this number's off. Yeah.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  I was like that looks really expensive.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Suddenly got a real expensive. Yeah… this would lock you into a 39 dollar per seat on an annual basis.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  So, this is the discounted rate that we're working from the discounted annual rate, right?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So 65 is annual, right? 85 is monthly?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Okay. So if we decide to stick with that tier, we could, we, those prices are what we would be looking at, not this one, then, yeah, there you go. You switch.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yep. And it's all because the way that our billing system works is I put in a flat discount and you will check out within the app.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Okay. Other question I have is some of our team is contractors. So there's very well, two people on our team are contractors. And so we swap them out based on whatever is happening with our pipeline of clients. Do we have to buy new licenses or can we change or when, or is it like figma, where, you pay for, the seat remains and you can just pull somebody out and put somebody else in.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's like figma. Okay?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  That's the best.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  I used to hate it until I had a larger, you know, now we have like seven people and I love it now because it's actually easier once, you know, once you know the game, it's easier to actually manage the organization.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Okay. Cool. Yeah, we'll make a decision. I think in the next couple of days by the end of the week, I would say it's probably reasonable. And then what should we do? Just follow up with you? And you just throw us a promo code or something like that to.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Yep. Follow up with me. I'll take care of it on the back end and then you'll have the normal checkout experience?

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Awesome. And.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Now, I'm annoying my product team to get this on the list. So I.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  got, yeah, if you could let us know about that, Alex, that'd be really great to get it onto the active list. That'd be really helpful. So, yeah, standard shared feature. Yeah, be different. It'd be, it'd, be nice. Hey, Maria, when we're like 50 then we just tell Alex, nah, that's what we need… and Alex is like, it's like 20 grand.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly. I'm like sure. I'll go yell at the product or I'll go work with the product team.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  He'll work with them. He'll just be like, it's 20 grand. So, yeah, that one top five right now. How fast can you do it? Yeah, the pleasure of being a large organization, right? Exactly. Yeah. But anyway, Alex, appreciate your flexibility. Appreciate you getting back to us so quickly on that. That sounds like a reasonable kickback. We'll sorry… response. Kickback sounds like the wrong thing. And yeah. Well, I don't think that we have a problem following up with you by the end of the week, okay?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Sounds like a plan. Awesome. Yeah, I'll let you know if we, any updates happen on that other piece.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  I would really appreciate that. Thank you.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Cool. Talk to you later.

Roger Kondrat (roger@openrangedevs.com):
  Cheers, bye.
