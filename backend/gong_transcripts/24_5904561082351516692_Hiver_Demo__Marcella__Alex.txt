Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  hi. Can you hear me?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yes, I can. Hi. How are you doing good?

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  How are you today, Alex?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I'm pretty good. It's been a busy week.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  But, yeah, I see that. Let's… look at JMP. Yeah, I see that JMP, the label has an E commerce business, assuming that you're looking at this for customer service operations, you know, kind of a shared email experience for your team, being able to see who's owning this plus potential deep links to Shopify or woocommerce.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Yeah, it would definitely be integration with Shopify. And the only other concerns of integration would be meta because we do have socials and Gmail. Okay?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  We don't offer the meta integrations. Okay? Just as a heads up, we do work with Gmail, and can do like Shopify order pops on the customer record.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Okay. That's helpful. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  But, yeah, we'd love to learn a little bit more about your business. What you guys are trying to accomplish with this project myself? I've been in the help desk space for 11 years, very familiar with E. Com. I worked at a company called customer was like one of their first employees.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Oh, wow. Yeah. I've seen their work. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I'm sure they are targeting you.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  But, yeah. So as far as this company, our customer service team is small by small. I mean, it's me. So basically, the decision is mine, what platform I want to use. We're currently using gorgias. And honestly, it's just overpriced for the quality of the system. Like I don't love it. It doesn't make my life any easier. From what I can see, it looks like hiver's pretty direct. That's what. I want to just be able to communicate with customers. I like that you have Shopify integration that just makes it easier for me to have the database of the orders on a day to day basis.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  We're looking at if… we're not running a sale, we're averaging 15 to 20 orders a day when we are running a sale, which is when we have all the high volume of customer service, it's about 60 to 70 orders a day. So on average, like we only operate Monday through Friday for customer service. When I come in on a Monday, usually, I'm looking at about 90 to 120 customer service emails that I have to respond to. But that is also including our meta integration. So it's our Instagram, DMS, our Facebook messages, comments on Instagram and Facebook. So that does take up a lot of the space as well. But yeah. So I'm just looking for something that's a little bit more streamlined and a little bit more in our budget.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Great. Well, let me kind of show you what we're working with. Okay?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So,

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  so we'll work backwards first, just in terms of pricing. We have a pretty encompassing offer for 35 dollars per user per month, two user minimum. And this is on a month to month contract.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Unlimited service. You get technical support, everything that you'll need for 70 dollars a month. You say, hey, Alex, this looks great. We can use this long term. An annual plan starts at 50 dollars for two users per month. So 600 dollars paid annually.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Definitely a much better value than gorgias.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Yeah. I think that's we're looking at more than triple that at gorgias.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, they nickel and dime you for everything.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  And it's not great. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  The way that hiver works is we are a shared inbox solution. So in Google Chrome, you download the hiver extension.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Okay. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  You're going to download this to your work email and then the support at domain or, you know, customer service at, we will create a shared inbox with that tool.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  I see. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  This is why you need users is you can have yourself and then maybe the owner of the business both have access to the shared inbox, within hiver. Yeah. Then when you log in for the day, you'll just have the list of unassigned emails here and you wouldn't get sentiment but you could have tagging, how I might use tagging. Yeah. How I might use tagging though is like, let me tag all these meta conversations… because then I could have, I can create something called the view and then I could see like all email requests versus meta. So then, you know, you can prioritize accordingly.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Okay. Or.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  You could just live out of one view. Then in this one, you know, we can see the tags that have already happened. I'm going to click into Steve's email… on the right hand rail is the kind of the ticketing experience that we're bringing into Gmail. Okay. So, you know, who's it assigned to probably yourself? Or you don't need to assign it the status of the email open pending closed. If somebody responds back, it reopens, we can have custom attributes on the emails… as well as activity feed or notes for.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  collaboration. Like what would be an example of a custom attribute?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Shipping status, refund status, you… know, contact reason.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Then on the contact, like we have Steve, and these are all the emails that Steve's ever written to support that's.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Good. I like that contact history, yep.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And then we have our connected apps. So this is where the Shopify card will live. We just turned. We're… just playing around with our connected apps. Let's see. Yeah. So it will look like the Salesforce card where it's just the customer name and then a link out to their record. So… it's pretty basic in terms of a Shopify app, but it does obviously job done. Yeah, yeah… exactly. Selling.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Bikinis, I'm not doing rocket science. I don't.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  yeah, especially it's you're a, you know, one woman shell like, yeah.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Honestly, for me, the easier it's better like.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And then when I click reply, you know, I have a full template library down here, nice.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that was, I didn't know if we could build templates, build macros, anything like that. Yep. Sick. Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  That's nice. Yeah. And then included in this plan is an AI assistant. So to write email replies, it'll ask you like what should I include? I don't know. I'll just say number two, you can also upload a knowledge base. So hiver has a KB solution that's included. It could be internal or external.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And then, you know, this… is the email that it wrote, could make changes and then send and close nice.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, that's pretty much the system. Should… there be multiple people that ever use this? We have a team view. So this is like everyone else in the system and the number of open conversations that they have. I.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  See. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And the list of all open conversations assigned to the team. And probably most interesting is these are these views. So it's just a search filter. So it's like show me all conversations that, you know, contain the following tags or custom fields or something else that's.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  pretty useful because I know Gmail's search feature is not the strongest. So, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  That's pretty much since we are like a overlay to Gmail. Like our whole value prop is building the things that people with, you know, customer support needs require. Gmail doesn't offer that's.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  sick. Yeah. Let me see if there were any other and we covered that. Yeah, I mean, this is honestly like… a pretty basic structure that I think would be really easy to navigate.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I think so too. We also, so the shared inbox obviously doesn't work with the Gmail app because it's Gmail's but we offer a standalone app for the solution… yep iPhone and android.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  That would probably be better for me because then I don't have to be here.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah. Like I'm working from home today?

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Yeah. I don't that's only customer service is only part of my job. So it's never.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I see. And then we do offer an analytics suite. If it's one person I think it's more about like… we call it like workload or performance. So you can come in here, select your date range. I… just have last 90 selected… and workload is the number of new conversation active. Is number of open emails. New? Is new emails in this period? Resolved? Is ones that have been marked done during this period. And then we're measuring it over like classic customer service metrics. Yeah.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  My boss would be, he loves a good, he loves a good data set. So this is good to know exactly.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And if you are assigning them to yourself or you just see how many emails have been sent a person, and then this is all drillable. So you can look at per individual's performance.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Yeah. So that's super useful. If you're a big team, you can see who's putting in the most work exactly.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And if, you know, you ever go on vacation, you know, you can just give someone else access and see how they did. Wow, that's cool. Yeah. Okay. My final piece of value. So up… here is the admin panel or however settings… we're going to go to the admin panel in a second. But one other call out is our support. So we have a 24 seven, 365 technical support over chat and they'll hop on a quick call with you if you need any assistance like setting something up or, you know, anything else that's.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  good to know. Yeah, but.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  From the admin panel, each shared inbox has its own settings. You'd have a singular shared inbox, but you get up to two in your plan. Yeah. So within this inbox, a couple things worth noting is one, we have an automation layer. So this is how we can do automatic tags, assign priority things of that nature. And it's like if this, then that logic based on trigger events. Okay? So like a new conversation is received, you know, if,

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  you know, the domain that we received the email from is no reply at Instagram. Com. I'm sorry, not domain the, from email.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  You know, or is one of, you know, you could.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Then I can auto apply a tag so that I can create essentially a search in the future of like all the, these types of conversations?

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Nice. Okay. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So we could automatically like put these to pending if you wanted. So it's like, and then you could have just a search that says like meta pending.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Yeah, just temporarily put them in their own little box.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly like I, if there's things that aren't as urgent like that's how we often see people operating.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  But yeah, that's kind of the quick walkthrough of what we're up to.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Honestly, I like the simplicity of the platform. I don't… think I have any questions. We kind of covered everything that I needed to know and I like that there's a price like if we just want to try it out for a month and then maybe lock into a month. Like can we do that? Try it out for a month and then lock into an annual subscription?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yep. And it's all self managed here.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Okay. Cause yeah, I think we literally would just have two users. I think it would just be the support domain that we have and probably my boss.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's super common. So, we have over like 3,000 businesses using this and we're with a lot of small teams and then some much larger teams.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Is there any common issues that you feel like people run into?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, for… your use case, not really.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Yeah, it's more on a big scale, but they probably, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's like if you have to like move an email between departments and they're not working in the same shared inbox to begin with, that gets pretty messy.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And yeah… I know the support space for like the E commerce help desk space pretty well. And I… for what you're looking for, I think this is one of the best or probably one of the best options. Yeah.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Cause I was looking at customer as well and I was like, doesn't really seem like a good fit, too complex. Yeah, that's and that's how I feel about gorgias is way too complicated for what needs to happen. Yeah. And,

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  then like everything.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Else?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Is going to be like a standalone ticketing platform. And I think this is just so simple since you're already managing other elements of the business. Like you don't have to like go somewhere new. Okay?

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  That sounds cool. Yeah. Honestly, I think we covered everything we need to cover today, cool.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Well, I'll send you the signup instructions. Okay? It's really easy. You download the Google Chrome extension and you follow the steps, log in with your personal work email, and then authenticate into the shared inbox. Okay. Oh, the last cool thing and I'll include this recording. So we are a we're working up like Gmail protocols. So there's a couple of there's one Gmail setting that you should set up. Okay? So from the gear icon to all settings accounts, you're… going to add another email address, which will be your customer. Oh.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Yeah. The alias, right? Yep.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And then when replying it's going to default to reply from your personal address, you want to reply from the same address that it was sent to for the alias?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And then in the general settings, so kind of tabbing over… you're going to want to create or potentially you want to create a signature for the alias. So, you know, you'll choose your alias and then, you know, have a signature there. And we… have a lot of, you know, people that will just use like their personal, a personal name on the signature. So it feels more one to one but it's up to you. Yeah.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  That's what I do. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's really that easy. It's a setup.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Very streamlined.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I like it. Don't like please chat with our support team. If you have any questions like these, we staff during us hours, we staff between like four to seven live technical support people.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Wow. Yeah. Some of the other platforms I was looking at, they don't have 24 seven support. No, I mean, I understand like that's hard to maintain especially across global timelines. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we, our technical support teams like over 30 people. Yeah, cost of doing business.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  That's sick. Awesome. Well, thank you so much for your time, Alex. I appreciate it.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, thanks for your time too. Yeah, it was nice to meet you and let me know if you need any help down the line.

Marcella Bilotto (marcella@jmpthelabel.com):
  Okay, perfect. Thank you. Okay. All right.
