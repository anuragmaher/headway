Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Dez. This is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Yeah. How are you doing, matt?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good. How are you doing?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Good. Thanks. Awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, appreciate you joining here. So, the agenda for the call today, just wanted to spend the first couple of minutes here, getting an understanding of, you know, your motivations with hiver, what you're looking for, helping you determine if it can fit your needs. And then from there, I can answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good? Sure. Awesome. So, yeah, tell me a little bit about what's going on.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  I'm looking for a cost savings alternative to… my.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Current solution, which is help scout. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. Absolutely. And how many people do you have on your team that could be using this? Three, three people?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And, okay. And do you have, do you have like a shared email address already set up that you guys use? Yeah, yeah, I.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  use I have in helpscout. Currently, we have three, okay, three shared emails. We're a Google workspace company.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Shared emails, Google workspace. Fantastic. Awesome. That sounds good.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Let.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  me, go ahead and share my screen here. And are you familiar with how hiver works? Or do you want to spend like 10 minutes of me walking through that as well?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Yeah, if you don't mind, I would appreciate that. Thank you. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, of course. Absolutely. I want to.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Like, I want to make sure I think from what I can see that it's a cost savings, but I want to make sure that I'm making the right decision. I'm not going to lose any functions and it's going to save me money, okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I think, yeah, I think it, I think it could, we definitely have the features where I, you know, we're we have, you can use hiver very simply or hiver can get quite robust. You know, we have over 10,000 companies using us ranging from small businesses up to enterprise companies like capital one with thousands of licenses. So it is quite powerful and scalable. And yeah, there's different options when it comes to pricing here. So we can determine that. But basically how hiver works is it's an extension, right? You simply download the extension. Once you download the extension, you're going to see these yellow icons on the top right here. You're going to see them down here on the left and you're going to and you're going to connect, your emails to these folders. So each email is going to have its own folder. Okay. And then for each folder, you can set up different workflows and different categories, tags, et cetera. And anytime somebody emails that address, it's going to land in the unassigned folder here. And… now, when you open an email, you're going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can go ahead and assign it to each other. Okay, right? You can set the statuses for these emails. I.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Just, I like the idea that it's like in my Google, my Gmail. So I don't have to like go to multiple windows because right now, I have to like go into helpscout for one email. And then I have to go into Google business or Google groups for my other email. And so I just like the idea of that. And then when I sign up, like, can someone help me set everything up so I can make sure I'm optimizing my account?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, we have you're not going to get like catered onboarding but what we do have is we do have 24 seven chat and phone support. Okay. Perfect. Yeah, cool. Exactly. Yeah. And it's all conveniently in your email, so you can answer your personal emails and then have easy access to the shared addresses, which is, you know?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  So this email comes in, let's say it's one of my patients asking to book an appointment. So it goes in here. Can you just reply to it here? Or do I have to assign it to someone to reply to it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, absolutely. You just, you can just reply right here.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  And when you reply to it, what email will be sent from? Does it get sent from your email or will it get sent from like the shared email? You?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Could set that up. As you can see here, I can choose whether it's my personal or the shared email.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Okay. I want to make sure like when my staff, if someone else were to reply to, it comes back to this shared inbox that if they're not available, I can pick it up and help the client, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. That is another whole function of hiver, is that, all these back and forwards emails are going to be logged and visible for you. Okay. So, so, if somebody's out or you're out, you can easily see it.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Another question for you with helpscout. When I, when we send an email, it at the bottom of the email, there's a bit of there's a little prompt to ask for like a satisfaction rating. Do, do you guys have that in yours? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Csat score? Yep.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  So, it can go in the bottom and then not that many people link to it, but like there are some people that will do it. And, I like to see the responses. It's fun. Yeah. Okay. Great. What about Instagram and Facebook messages?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No social media connections? Okay?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  No problem. No problem. Just… trying to think. What about you and I are going to reply to this email together? Do you guys have collision detection? Yep?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  And what does that look like?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's can.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  you somehow show me?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I can't show you, but,

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  like, so if I'm typing this email, will it tell me someone else is editing this?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Huh. Okay. And then, and then we can like create tags, as a team that are like these are appending, like we can create our own tags, like.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  What are these yep, tags? Completely customizable? What?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  About customer profiles? Does hiver, like have a customer profile?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Okay. So, it'll group customer info together. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, it'll show all the emails associated with that customer. Okay?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Great. Okay. Great.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  And it's… the growth one gives me, gives us two inboxes. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Let me double check here. Things were updated. So, yeah, if you come down here, they're all nested there's usage limits… exactly. Yeah, the growth gives you allows you to have up to two and then the pro allows you to have up to five. Okay. Right. So, if you had three, you'd have to use pro, but if you just had two, you can just leverage growth.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  But, but what you could do is like, I have several groups, but what I could do is I can like forward them off into the one of the two that we have on hiver, right? You?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, so, yeah. So, so if you did that within hiver, you can, we call it an alias and you could set up one per shared mailbox, what happens?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  If I just had a forwarding one,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  If you just have like a forward, I think that would work. Yeah, I think that would be fine.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Okay. Cause the alias, the one email alias like hiver is managing that, right? But if I do a forward through Google, you guys aren't even managing it, it's just more. It's just to you guys. It looks like it's coming in from the two that are there.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And so.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Is there a way? So, is there a way for you to like help me get set up with an account again? But where I don't get billed until February?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  My other?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Account expires?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So you have a couple options first of all, you, could you, what you, could, we do offer seven day free trials? So you, could you're you have a free account, right?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  I don't know, I think so.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you have a free account. Is that?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Enough for me to like work in there and set it up. So it's ready to transfer?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, the free account is very limiting. The only other option you could do would be the monthly, so you could sign up for a month to month. There's one more thing. There's one more thing you need to consider and that is that hiver does sell in buckets. So there's the two user. So you can purchase two users and the next bucket after that is five users.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  So it, so it,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  is kind of sold in buckets for, the user accounts?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Okay. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, so if you have three people, you would need to buy a bucket of five licenses. Okay. How?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Much would that cost?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's just, whatever plan that you choose, multiply it by five. So, and if you're going to pay for the year up front or if you're going to do month to month?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Oh, I can't why can't I just buy three? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, unfortunately, yeah, it's sold in buckets.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Just because a lot of our customers are, you know, range… and kind of bigger size companies. So it just makes it a lot easier to have it set up in buckets as opposed to bill billing every time, they want to add somebody.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  So, where do you see that? It's sold in buckets? Yeah. When you, when you go to check out, when you go to the usage limits, it says the users you need a minimum for growth, it's a minimum of two and a maximum of 10, but it doesn't say that you have to buy in buckets of five.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I was told they were going to update it on the website. I'll have to you're.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  you're giving me like contradicting information, and I would suggest that you would have don't, you have to like if it's on the website like I feel like you should you have to like go by that? Yeah, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. But yeah, you'll see actually if you go to, if you go to check out within your account, when you go to sign up and you select the amount of people that you have, you'll see that you can only choose two users five, 10 15?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  And now, I got to add the extension.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, were you looking to make the switch now or you're waiting until the end of January to make the switch? I.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Want to wait until I'm not paying for… helpscout… anymore, but I think I might have to pay for a month of hiver, just so I can be up and ready to go.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, you have three people here, one?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Of my settings like one of my settings?

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  A great plan.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Yeah, that's annoying.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Yes. Yeah, there.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  And is that billed in American or Canadian dollars?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  American… I know the conversion rate is not great right now. No. Okay. That's going to.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  Give me something to think about because the website did not advertise that. Yeah, absolutely.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to pass that feedback back to our team as well. All.

Dez Bair-Patel (dez@ihcentre.ca):
  right. Let me think about it. I'll be in touch. Okay, Matthew? All good?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Appreciate your time today. Dez have a good one. Take care bye.
