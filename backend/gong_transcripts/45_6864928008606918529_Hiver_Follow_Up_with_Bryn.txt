Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Brynn. This is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  Hi, matt. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Doing well. How are you doing? I'm.

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  good. I had a couple technical difficulties this morning with my computer, but we're back up and running now.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, no problem. I was a bit late here too, so I appreciate the patience here, but yeah, just wanted to obviously check in here, get an update from, you, see how everything's going.

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  Absolutely. I honestly have been really enjoying the platform. I wasn't able to get our UK team up and running on it, but we were able in the time to set up the Netsuite integration and that has been really nice. And following the advice from the last call, we changed the hiver sentiment to the five point scale which seems to have fixed what we were seeing. And we tried out more of the AI tagging which was also really helpful. So it was really nice to try out some more of those AI features that we hadn't tried yet. So, yeah, we were really impressed and happy. I think the UK team will hopefully see about getting them on. I guess they were maybe a little less willing than they made it seem. But yeah, I was just wondering what the next steps would be to move forward with moving off of the trial and keeping our hiver subscription?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, of course. Yep. I can just send you a quote.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'll send you a quote we just need or you could let me see here. How many. So we saw in buckets of five. It looks like you have five people in there now? Is it five?

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  Yeah, I think well, that's what actually I wanted to ask about our, it wants to have access so that they can onboard and offboard if needed?

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  Is that something that like, is there, like do they have to have a seat for that? Because they won't be using the platform. It'll be exclusively for just if someone leaves the company to offboard.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, they would need a seat for that. Unfortunately, we don't really have like a non billed seat.

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  Okay. Yeah. I wasn't sure if there was like a paid seat… but like a not as advanced offering. But yeah. So I think we would need five including like it and all that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, is it five plus it? How many total? Is?

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  It five including it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Includes it. Okay, perfect. And then got it. And you mentioned that you'd like to use in the AI stuff. So the AI is all packaged together. It's an additional 20 dollars per user. Did you want to get that? Did you want to include the AI as well?

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  Yeah. I think for now, we wanted to look into keeping the AI.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. And then let me see here. How many mailboxes do you have? You have one mailbox? Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Let me show my screen here. So we have the growth package and the pro package, right? I know we talked about this. I think we maybe talked about this on the first call, but it's easier now since, you know, how hiver works. So pro is a bit more expensive and the reason that is because it has additional features. So it has business hours for the slas, it has the ability to create custom dashboards and it has the SLA analytics. Was there anything here in this one that made you feel you want pro or are you good with growth?

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  Yeah, that's what was difficult was that like I feel like on a general level, growth is the better fit for us, but I really liked the business hours and the like SLA, I think it was the S or the csat?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, customer satisfaction surveys.

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  No. So it was the slas then? Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. The SLA reporting. Yeah.

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  So, I kind of am leaving that up to my manager to decide for us if they, you know, really, you know, care a lot about the slas or if they don't care too much about tracking that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Okay. Great. So what I can do is I can email you what the pricing would be for both options with the AI, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then just let me know which option you want to do, and I'll send over a quote for signature, and then once we get it signed, we issue you an invoice and your account's live.

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  Amazing. Okay. I have a meeting today booked with my manager, so, and we're going to review strictly this. So I'll bring this to her and let her make the call and what she deems as what they want to have on the system?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Sounds good. Bryn, appreciate it.

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  Awesome. Perfect. Well, thank you so much.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks bye.

Bryn Cranston (bryn.cranston@certn.co):
  Bye.
