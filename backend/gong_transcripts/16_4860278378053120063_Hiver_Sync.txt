Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hello? Hey, good morning, team. How's everybody doing?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Good, good. How are you today?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Doing well, doing well. I have a solutions, one of our solutions specialists coming on. Let's just give him like a minute here. I'll just send him a message.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. I see. Manoj just joined. Awesome.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. So, Manoj is here. So just to kick off the call team. So just to set a quick agenda, I thought we could use this time to answer some additional questions that you might have as you've been testing the solution. I also, do, you know, have an update from the couple of those requests. One in terms of the bulk ads being added into hiver, that is something that we can assist with correct Manoj bringing in bulk tags into hiver for them. So they don't have to manually create them one by one?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Hi, hi, guys. So, you mean the labels to tags?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, labels to tags?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Well, no, just, we don't have the labels or the tags right now. But if we did a CSV excel file, could you upload them and create the tags for us?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yes, that is possible. And Manoj approximately how many tags are we talking about?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Probably approximately 506 150, probably 700 tags.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  It, that's why we don't want to enter them manually.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I can see that for sure. Okay, cool. And then in terms of the editing contact information asked. So that is something. And in order for us to build out for our clients like these special requests, there essentially has to be like a minimum threshold of spend. So if you can get like your account spend to 6,000 on an annual basis. This is something that we can scope out and see what it would take to build post, you know, post signature, essentially, it's something we'd have to scope out and look at and see if we.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Can do it. We don't have that many contacts. We have multiple. No, no, we have 5,400 in helpscout. No, he's saying, I think spent 6,000 dollars?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So essentially, yes. So for us to build something there would have to be like a minimum, what?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Was it, what was it per user at the, whatever level we were talking about? I think it was elite.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The elite version is 75 dollars per user per month.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Oh, no, no, no, that's the highest one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Oh, you're thinking the pro?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah, that's because I didn't recognize. Was it 59?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The pro is 45 per user per month on an annual commitment and then it's 55 dollars per user per month on a month to month contract.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  10, I would say 10 to start off 5,454 100. So, we haven't met the threshold 6,000 he's saying if we pay them 6,000 a year, they could build it. Oh, OK. So that's 6,000 in addition to the membership or a total of 6,000?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Just total spend of 6,000 dollars.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  That's not unreasonable. OK. So, we're OK, with that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's something we need to scope out to understand what we can do about it specifically. But like we will like if you're spending 6,000, like you can hop on a call with our engineering team, talk with them, what you specifically look for, and then we'll be able to scope out what we can do from that perspective.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  OK. But it's not guaranteed.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I don't believe it's guaranteed.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Does, if these contacts were in the special Ed, trans contacts, would hiver would use them, correct?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Like they're from they're sitting in your Google contacts perspective?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Correct.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Munoz, do you have insight on that?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, if we could populate special Ed, trans, Google contacts with the contacts that we need, we'd be better off. We'd be better off, yeah, because they're editable… and you can add multiple phone numbers and multiple contacts per company or do you not, do you have a special contacts just for hiver?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Oh, OK. So we do have contacts only for hiver. So whatever import or anything build that we'll be doing will be under hiver contacts.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, hybrid contacts are separate from the mailboxes, Google contacts.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes. The hybrid contacts and Gmail contacts are not linked.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  That's a shame. Yeah, because they're just bringing them in. They're creating more and more. So, if you get 10 people working at one company, we got 10 different email addresses, then you go to a new. Yeah. But again, the problem with hiver is it looks at the end of the email. So at Gmail. Com, and it uses that as the company instead of looking at the actual contacts, we have very few contractors who have an actual domain that means anything. Yeah. And the districts have the districts, yeah, that would be fine, not the contractors, not the contractors.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  OK. So correct me if I'm wrong. So, most of the people who are reaching out to you has the free Gmail domain, not the actual domain, but they do belong to a company.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Our bus drivers have the Gmail even though they belong to a mom. Most of them, a lot of them are mom and pop companies… and they have multiple email or Gmail accounts with abc trans or, and then somebody else's abc trans dispatcher. So it's at Gmail. Com. So they've created. So if… hiver uses its current model to create the contacts database for the special Ed, trans email box, we'd have a Gmail company. We'd have a yahoo company. We'd have a hotmail company with multiple actual companies within that.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Understood understood. Yeah, with the current model that's the case, but Cole, correct me if I'm wrong, that is what we are planning to build, you know, to be able to edit the company domain, you could still have the Gmail addresses listed as contacts, but you can add them basically to a company.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, you're saying that's already in the pipeline?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's what we were planning to build. Yes. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, that's what we want to scope out specifically for you to see if they can match.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  OK.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, essentially, the team would scope out the ability to like edit the company's contacts and stuff like that. They just want to get on a call with you to understand what specifically it is. So they can, you know, let you know what's available, what's not?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  OK.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  The product team and the engineering team is already aware of the outline, like you want to be able to edit the domains to companies, add those Gmail addresses as contacts and whatever. But again, as Cole mentioned, we would just need another call with the product team. OK? Just to make sure what all you're expecting so that they can take a note of it and build it out for you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 100 percent. And, but it seems like regardless of the team, I know you said it was more of like a nice to have last call. Does it seem like the team wants to move forward? Like with hiver off of helpscout at this point or what kind of makes the most sense? No.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  That was the question too. We couldn't remember what was said about migrating from helpscout. I thought that we had discussed that it's basically whatever is in Gmail, will still be in Gmail, that you guys really don't migrate from one product to another, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no. So, like whatever's in Gmail is in Gmail, we can import historical emails from your account. So, if you did want to bring in those historical emails into hiver to have for reference, that is something we can look to as well. We just want to understand the volume, what emails you'd want to bring in. And there's a one time small charge associated with it, usually like a couple 100 bucks or something.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  OK. We had talked about the automatic workflows in the backgrounds and somebody was going to send me the knowledge base information. I haven't gotten that yet.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The knowledge base information on.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  On creating those workflows?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The automations?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  OK. Let me, I can send this to you right now.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  And with minaj on the line, we talked about that, we can see the conversation id when we kind of drill down onto that link for that three dots with the lines between them. However, we were wondering if it could go on to an email?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, it is possible.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah, that's what we're looking for because right now helpscout signs and you can see what conversation id you're looking at. So you can tell somebody to look up an email with an id. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Understood, let me show.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  My screen or drilling down and finding it all the time. Yeah… that said Cole, we are interested in hiver, however, we're visiting another esc on Monday, we don't know what product they're using, if they're using a product right now, hiver is our number one option. Yeah. But we're going on a field trip on Monday and we could get back to you on Tuesday.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. In.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  The meantime, send me that knowledge base information.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I just said that in the zoom chat too. So if you click on that link, this gives you access to the advanced automations and how tos,

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. And guys, just a quick view on the conversation ids. There are a couple of ways one, you can just click on the share option and share the conversation id or paste it in the notes section.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay. Yeah, we know that we have to drill down. We saw that. Is there another way? No?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And then while replying to an email, if you want to add the id and send it across, you just have to add like, you know, click on the number symbol right there.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  That's good. That's perfect. Yeah, that's at the level of responding. And can that be if somebody in the group is asking somebody else to open an email, can that be searched on?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes. So in the Gmail search bar, just do Cid. And then the conversation id, you paste it and you can just search for it. Okay?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Interesting. It's for conversation id. Yeah. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Thank you. And this conversation id guys, you can, you know, let's say that you want to set up an autoresponder for all the incoming emails. This conversation id can be an autofill variable as well, so that after every new email, you send out an acknowledgement email along with the conversation id.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Could you show us that?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes… chat inboxes support autoresponder… you can set up an autoresponder stating according to business hours, and you can have one for outside business hours and one for during business hours. And then, yeah, you do autofill, variable, click on the conversation id. So this just gets pasted automatically. You don't even have to do anything manually right here.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  So, autoresponder. All right. We do like your product. I think Sharon, I could say that Sharon described it as robust compared to helpscout. Yes, we had a question on the customer portal. How is the customer portal used? Because we're not using anything like that?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So… as it says, you create your own portal here, right? Customize your color coding, add your logos and everything. And you can also connect your own domain… so that it'll be like portal company. Com.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Is this something we would link to from our website?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No. So you're basically creating an entirely new web page, it's not going to be connected to your website. It's custom domain in the sense that by default, it's under hiverportal. Com, as you can see over here?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yes. So we would give a link to our districts and contractors. They would go to the link and then they could open a ticket with us, that would end up, yes?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, it comes in as a new email to your shared mailbox. Okay? And you can customize your ticket, basically the form settings, subject line issues, attachments, or if you want to add a couple of.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We could force them basically to put our route number in. Yeah, and we could put a link to the portal on the website. Yeah, exactly, or send it in emails. Yes, faster way to do this. Yeah. Okay. I think that explains it. Good. That's a good option. Thank you. Yes, thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then team. So you're starting off with Ted licenses, I believe, right?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And you guys take.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  purchase orders, right? Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. That's no issue. And then would you want the AI to be included in the proposal? So that's an additional 20 dollars per user per month?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  I don't think we need it, right? I don't think we need it right now. I would think it would be something we would consider in the future.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. So I will, I can send you and you wanted to start off on the month to month or the annual agreement?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  We would do annual, but again, we would give you our final decision on Tuesday. We don't want you to go to too much extra work. We just want to see what the other esc is doing for.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Sure. For sure.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Yeah, we would want to do it annually for 10. And right now, I think it's at pro I'm guessing it would be just a literally a switch. If we decided we, instead of pro, we needed elite, we could just make that change and do another po and it would be automatic. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent, you could upgrade whatever. So, and I can just go over the pricing plan. So you're aware of the differences.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Let's see. The pro plan gives, you know, up to five shared mailboxes, you can manage 20 automations per shared mailbox. It gives you csat surveys the capability for business hours for reporting and slas, load, balance, round Robin and custom dashboards, analytics for csat and SLA.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  And then, and then.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The elite version gives you custom objects, personal inboxes, shared mailbox automation, skill based routing. So we do have like an assign among feature where let's say, you know, three three requests come in that are a billing request and you want them to be round Robin amongst a group of three people that is an elite feature.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  What do you mean by custom objects?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, essentially, we give you that ability to import external data whether it's like an excel sheet or from your CRM to create dynamic automation rules.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Not at this point, but we're with… the pro. They're going to be able to create that inbox that shows unassigned or pending. Yeah, we learned how to do that. We did two of us, right? Phil and I, we started watching your, the one link. It's a really long training process where it talks with admins and then it talks you through and it's two people, a man and a woman. I've gotten maybe through like 20 minutes. Phil has watched almost the entire thing. Do you have anything that's more? Yeah, short like we're going to be, think of it as a role of member because that's one of your roles. We don't want them to see everything we want them to see snippets so that they can take for sure. You have stuff like that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. We have product walkthroughs that'll take you through the user experience. So you're not seeing like the admin stuff. We'll also like a part of your onboarding, you'll get team training, like we're happy to run the team through it as well.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Could we train at a later time after implementing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, of course. Yeah, it's open whenever.

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But when would be a good time team to touch base with you on? Let's say Tuesday?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Any time between eight a M and I'm not here. Oh, she's not here on Tuesday, but we would know, yeah, eight a M and.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Two PM on Tuesday, that's est, right?

Kristin Self (kself@somersetcountyesc.org):
  Say that again?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, yeah. You guys are based out of jersey. Okay, cool. That is perfect. So, I'll send an invite for one 30 est. Yeah, that would be fine. Okay, perfect. But I really appreciate, you know, the time today team, we're looking forward to potentially partnering with you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Let us know if there's any other questions in the meantime, and I hope you all have a great weekend. Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay. Take care guys. Thank you guys.
