================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, arfat. Can you hear me?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Hey, Raghav. Yeah, I can hear you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hi. How are you doing?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  I'm good. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Doing good. I'm doing good about getting ready for the veterans day holiday tomorrow.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Oh, nice. That is good. I didn't know well, my company doesn't celebrate it, that's yeah, good for you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Alright. Thanks, man. Thanks. I usually work us timings right? So I get to take federal holidays off instead of the Indian holidays. So it's a bit of a trade off, but, yeah, win. I guess at the end of the day, hey, arfat. Where are you dialing in from? If you don't mind me asking?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  I am based out of Toronto, actually, Canada.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that's sweet. I have a younger brother who moved to Toronto about like five years back. He's now in Vancouver, moved there two years.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Ago. Oh, nice. Nice. Yeah, I was in the us for about like 10 years or so. I just recently moved to Canada myself. Yeah, alright.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  How are you liking the shift? If you don't mind me asking?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  It's good. Yeah, there's like, you know, pros and cons, I would say, but overall, yeah, I've been liking it. Yeah, I moved from the east coast, so it's very similar.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Ah, that makes sense.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Good for you. Alright, arfat. Introductions. I'm Raghav, let me put a face to the name as well. Hi, I'm going to be working with you as the account manager. I've been working with udita in the background during the course of the partnership. I've been with the hiver business for about eight years. And for today's, call happy to discuss the AI feature suite that we have to offer.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Cool. Alright. Yeah, man. I'm not going to turn on my camera just because I'm hideous right now. Yeah. So I just wanted to have like a really quick chat about the AI stuff because… well, I've been liking it but I see that it's not really. I mean it's like a premium feature.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  So I wanted to know like what the pricing structure is and if there's anything like, you know, that it can be associated with just the managers or something like that. Currently, I've just been using it for the sentiment part. The hiver AI sentiment that's been handy. It mainly ties into like me trying to keep on top of my team's emails. What I've asked for before with hiver is a way for me to check the elapsed time. And, I'm gonna ask you this as well. So I have some automation set up but there is no automation feature in hiver that allows me to check for a certain time elapse. So, for example, say I have a team of five people. One of the engineers is kind of, you know, he's not say he's not responding to emails online. And I have a, you know, a time in my mind or an SLA for our team that hey, you gotta reply within 24 hours for every email. And within hiver. Once you pre assign, like if the email is assigned out there's no way for hiver's automation to really tell if, you know an email came in on that pre assigned email from a customer and say 24 hours have passed after that email from the customer asking for an update. There's no way automation can like update me or give me a notification of any kind. So that's something that I've been struggling with. And this AI feature has been kind of like a band aid just because I've enabled it. So I can get these negative sentiment emails like just notified whenever you know, a client is kind of unhappy with one of our agents or one of our engineers. So yeah, it's twofold I'm going to share my screen. I'll just walk you through what I have right now for this AI portion.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, for sure. Definitely. And I love that you called it twofold because that's how I wanted to start the solution. So, yeah, I'll let you run me through what you've got for now. And then I'll jump into solutioning mode on my side.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Okay. Yeah. So for the AI part, I've just got it where it's tagging, the sentiment analysis… does the tagging and then I have an automation tied in so that whenever it's a negative or a very negative sentiment, I'm going to get like a notification.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Makes sense. All right. Okay. That makes sense. That's pretty straightforward there.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah. So this is very straightforward. I just wanted to like this again for me because I manage the team. So I want to get notified when there's like negative emails or something like that coming in. And then, yeah. So other than that, this is the other one right now, I have it disabled. But what I wanted it to do is say an external reply is received on any email. And if the, I wanted there to be a way to have an elapsed time, let me see if I can find it. There is okay. That's a notification.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I think, I know what you're talking about. So how, like how prevalent and how pressing is this elapsed time?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  It becomes pressing when it happens, you know, that's the issue like it, it's not like an engineer is like constantly doing it but, you know, because we're busy sometimes it happens and I just want to, you know, stay on top of it, kind of like remind them, if it happens. And so just so the engineer is able to recognize and correct it when it happens. So right here, there's a time pass since, right? And no external reply. So this is for the external replies but, there's… no like time pass since, you know, like since the reply is received, I wanted to have a 24 hours of time and then kind of give me a notification if our response has not been sent. Do you get what I'm saying? I hope I'm explaining, yeah, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, makes sense. So what you want to do is basically track it based on internal replies, not external replies pretty much.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yes. Yeah. Pretty much. So if you can tell me like, you know, hey, 24 hours have passed since the external reply was received. Yeah, because this basically tells you that it has the time pass since no external reply received. So it's basically waiting for a response from the customer. It's not really telling us when our agent have replied.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, definitely. I hear where you're coming from now. The first thing I do want to clarify is this time pass since as an automation condition, the first thing I want to highlight is that it's part of our elite package and you're right now on the pro package just to put that pretty clear. I realize this, you just go through renewal and everything. So, I'm just going to have a discussion with my team internally on, you know, whether you have access to this on pro as a special sort of caveat or, you know, what that looks like because within the system, we've now allowed our customers to pretty much use any feature instead of putting it behind a paywall. What will happen is you'll get a couple of alerts one week after enabling it, and the system will basically auto upgrade you if you continue usage of the feature, right? So that's why I wanted to be extremely certain of this in terms of the solution before I jump into the details, right? Okay. So that's the first piece. Yeah. Sorry, go ahead.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah. Is it something that like, I don't know the price jump between the two? But it's not something that I need for the entire team. It's mostly just for the few managers. So it would be like the number of shared inboxes that you see. I think it'd be useful for all the manager level people. So we have network team service and account manager. These are the main three. So it would be about three to four users.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. But I mean, just like with hiver and most of the software is out there, right? Any change, any features available on a higher tier will be affected at the account level. So if we do go down this route and you want to use external reply, which is an advanced trigger time pass, sense, date based creation, time based and things like that, it would require a full account upgrade to the elite plan, right? And this price on elite, I'm just sending you the help article or the faq article that details out what I've told you, right? All the advanced triggers that are on elite and elite only. Okay, that should give you a full list of the triggers, the actions, the conditions, everything that's on elite, so that's the perspective on the commercial front or at least the plan front. The list price for elite is at ust per person per month that's you know, the advertised price on the website.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And for most of our customers now, given, like I said, given that we just ran through renewal and I realized that there is an existing discount on your subscription as well. I'll have a check with my team if you're you know, interested in enabling this across the board for all 23 users, and that's something that I can check with the team to see the level of discounting available on the elite plan. If you're willing and open to upgrade for all of the advanced triggers that are there in that document I sent over.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Okay. Yeah. If it's if it's in there, I think we would be interested.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So all external replies from external reply, everything below that is an advanced sort of automation that's on the elite plan.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Like this section assignments changed exactly?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  External replies received, mailbox replies sent, see status received. If you scroll down just a bit more, there should be a table there you go. So these are all elite only triggers on automations.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Okay. Got it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So these are triggers. And if you keep scrolling, those are going to be the secondary conditions. So that's your time pass ins that's your C sat rating.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Time.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Elapsed, all of that bits, date based the whole thing. So the automation that you showed me would basically trigger a system alert for us in like 24 to 48 hours saying, hey, you've started using something on elite and, you know, the account is set for auto upgrade in X amount of time. So that's why I wanted to dump.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Ahead of the conversation. Yeah, this one still doesn't I don't think this has a way for me to tell if the time has passed since, let me see. So no external reply received. We want to have the time passed since the external reply is received, that's kind of the.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I get it. So what you're going for is basically a cross section here, which is, I don't necessarily want to track just the external reply, but I want to see from the moment the external reply is received to us since then, if my agent hasn't written back.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah, that's pretty much it like, you know, how Gmail has a thing like where you send an email and it basically says, hey, it's been three days since you sent this email or something like that. Yeah, something along those lines. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, tell me one thing, arfaad, because with the time passed since I'm sure we can solve for this because I've done this for a few of our other customers as well. Does your team when they send the reply, do they change the status?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  They don't they don't that's the thing they don't have that our workflow, we keep it in the inbox, like we don't update it. We don't go back and forth depending because the amount of emails we handle is quite large.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  So, it'll be difficult. Some users have like a ton of emails. Some users are kind of like, you know, clearing out their inboxes a bit more. Some people might be like on a longer vacation. It's just difficult for everyone to kind of track like even myself when I send the response out, I just leave it in my inbox, and then I purge the inbox once every like two weeks or so. Oh, like we don't go between the status. We don't use the pending status as much, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. And the only time you close an email is when you feel the whole thing is completed, right?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah. Because the email correlates to a case on our CRM software called Netsuite. Yeah. So we close it only when the case on Netsuite is completely closed. So we come back here as a final step.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. And I remember seeing a conversation about a Netsuite integration as well popping up.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yes, that's also something that I can bring up again if you want to go over. But yeah, I don't know how much time you have, but Netsuite is something we use a lot.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that makes sense. So, sorry. Yes, sorry, continue.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  I don't know. I'm saying Netsuite is our CRM software. And a lot of our emails that come in here, they end up as cases on Netsuite. So, a way for hiver to kind of be even more valuable to us is if there's a direct integration between the hiver inbox and Netsuite. And in Netsuite, we store these tickets as cases and cases usually just have like a number. So if there's an integration that, you know, we could do where the email is able to be turned into a case just by like a click from, you know, from your attachments or from the extensions, that would be really awesome.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, basically the ability to create a case on Netsuite?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Right from hiver?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  The hiver, right? Panel. Yeah. All right. That makes sense. Okay. You're not the first customer asking for this. So, I know that my product team has it on the radar. Let me just pump in your name as well to the list or I'm sure your name is already there. So let me maybe check with them to see if there's any early developments on that, but nothing I can offer right away, right? But it's actually pretty valid in terms of what you're looking for. All right. Makes sense. So keeping Netsuite aside for today's, discussion, right? Coming back to this scenario that you'd mentioned right? Where you want to track it based on internal replies, but your team doesn't use statuses and it only gets to closed once the whole thing is completed?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So status won't work, adding a tag is just manual effort. Would the team be open to adding a tag? Though? I do want to check.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  I think it would be just a lot like you said, I want to eliminate manual work.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  The best way would be, this automation like having that ability to check how long the, how long it has been since the email has come in?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. Okay. Let me do one thing at first. Let me check this, you know, obviously just brainstorm it with my team later and I'll also chat with udita, your dedicated success manager. Okay. Right. So between the two of us, we'll look for a couple of solutions or at least one solution that can help you more straightforward than the time passed since, yeah, in fact, yeah.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah. I just want to bring up that. I was trying to do something like a two step thing where, you know, it would tag the email if it's been beyond 24 hours. But even in tagging, I don't think we have that option. So that's something that your team needs to put in. I think even the tagging part like in terms of automation, it won't work cause it's just the feature is not there. Like, the option is not there at the moment. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  The reason why you don't see it at this point is because nine out of 10 hiver customers pretty much move the email to closed as soon as they send the reply. And it's only the second follow up email that the whole thing becomes reopened and starts off, right? And I'm talking about like finance teams, HR teams, standard support teams, customer success teams, sales teams as well. So, you know, that's a good subset of the kind of teams that are hiver customers over, the last six, seven years that we've been around as a business. So could be why you don't have that, you know, just in terms of like logical reasoning on that front, right? But then again, considering you don't close the ticket unless it's closed on Netsuite, I can see how trying to change that behavior might be a little tough on your side as opposed to checking out for workarounds on the hiver end.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Right. Let me think about it. Also. I have a question. I was trying to escalate this request with someone named Lucas.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. He's our SVP of customer success.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Okay. So I messaged him as well. Like I had a chat with one of your support techs. Okay. They kind of walked me through like how to do the automation, but right now, I, you know, they don't like right now we don't have that option where, you know, time elapsed since your reply is received, you know, the way to monitor that. So I had him just add a feature request for me and then I messaged Lucas as well after that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, I can track that conversation. Yep. Yeah, I can see what you're talking about. Yeah. So, yeah. So again, like I said, it's because of the just the general spread of hiver customers across the board. This isn't something that we've heard quite a lot of primarily because of just the logical way of how people usually handle it on hiver which is comes in send the reply, close it. And then when the second reply comes, do you need to action that email, right? And these are also teams that work similar to yours where there's something happening in parallel. There's other departments working in parallel, things like that. But the standard hiver behavior. And I'm guessing to a good extent standard ticketing system behavior from what I've seen in the market at least during my time is email comes in, you address it, you create your subtasks and everything, track it on any other software that you're doing it to where the actual work happens. And then in hiver, it kind of stays closed till or if the customer replies or till you have an update that you want to follow up on.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  We have, we have the additional headache of dealing with Netsuite. Well, that's.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  that's fine. That's fair. And again, it's a bit of a non standard workflow just to be fully transparent with you in that sense. But if Lucas has already put in a feature request, I'm sure it's already at the higher levels in terms of discussions on how can we solve for it? What it's going to look like. So what I'll do is I'll just drop him a note and udita your success manager as well. I'll drop the both of them a note after today's. Call with the recording and, you know, we look for any solutions that we can offer could be workarounds or could be like a temporary fix or something like that realistically would be to approach this from a different logical angle and see how we can solve for this, right?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Okay. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So again, even from my perspective, the normal way I've usually suggested customers to look at this as either, hey, just start using the status like just don't keep emails open for too long, right? It's as simple as that in terms of the standard cases. But like I said, non standard situation. So let me do one thing at first. Let me not try to rush and give you a solution that I'm not fully sure about or we haven't tested yet. So let me take this discussion back to Luke and udita, have them understand what the product team's understanding is like there. And, you know, if it leads to a product enhancement, then we'll be sure to keep you posted. If it's more of a midterm solution that we can offer as well. We'll be sure to give you a heads up on that too. Yeah.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Okay, perfect. And then, yeah, do you want to talk about the AI? Oh.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  AI. Yeah. So the sentiment is one thing that you've already enabled my suggestion after that was going to be, hey create a workflow, see that you get notified and all of that, you've already got that sorted out.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah… brilliant. So the next.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  thing that I wanted to check about, yeah, this is perfect. So the other thing that I wanted to ask you was the ask AI piece of hiver, right? Because that's been by far the piece of assistance, right? The AI feature that everybody loves. So why don't you click on AI copilot here for me? And I'm sorry, my sketching skills are not what they used to be back in school. So bear with me. But if you see this one here called ask AI, this has actually been the feature of AI on hiver that almost every other customer that I talk to loves and has good reviews about. So just to give you a quick overview on what it does think of it like gemini or chatgpt but purpose built for hiver trained on your data that you upload and being more and more precise as time goes by. The last part is standard across every LLM and every AI model. You'll run into the first two pieces. If you click on knowledge sources, you'll start seeing what I'm talking about, right? So unlike gemini or chatgpt or anything, the first advantage that ask AI will have is that you're pre training it with your knowledge sources. And when I say knowledge sources, these could be faq articles. These could be policies. It could be terms of service. On the other hand, it could be internal processes for your teams, ways in which they want to handle things and even best answers that you feel would help other team members if a similar case arises, right? So at this point, we've got it as a document upload and an article copy paste. In terms of a snippet, the document supported our PDF, text, docx, doc files, all the usual ones, right? And we will be rolling out support for notion and confluence in the coming months. Notion is higher because more of our customers use it as their knowledge base. Confluence, is another one that we are looking on as well. So I wanted to ask you where do you store your, I mean being in the space you are, where do you store your process documents, important information? Sops, things like that, everything.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Is, you know, we're basically Google drive oriented. So pretty much everything can be found on Google drive. We have a shared drive on Google drive. We also tried using notebook LLM, okay, Google offers. So like we dumped a bunch of this stuff into that, and then we're using that for a little bit. I'll.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  show you, yeah… for sure. I mean I've used notebook as well.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah. So, this one was what we were using a bit, but pretty much if you're asking about documents, it will all be Google, right? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Makes sense. All right. So the reason why I mean, thanks for talking to me about notebook LLM. I've tried to use that for my account research at work, but I can tell you from personal experiences notebook LLM is great for thesis style research. You know, when you want to like really get into the details and stuff like that, right? It does leave quite a bit wanting when you're trying to use it to like craft a response or craft a straightforward answer to something or at least that's as far as I've noticed and I've tested it. So when it comes to co pilot in comparison or ask AI in comparison, it's primarily purpose built purely for making the answering side of things easier, right? So that's the way it's configured. And I just checked our internal roadmap as well. So, you know, from the Google drive integration, we are looking at it more from a next year perspective, you know, tentatively quarter one next year if not a little later, right? It's like I said, our primary ask from our customer base has been mostly notion. So we're going to be looking at that first and then confluence as the next, you know, owm oem kind of perspective, right? But what I can tell you though is if you're open to doing like a one time effort, just dumping everything from each folder and uploading it onto the co pilot, then I'm sure, with that one time effort, you'll start seeing quite a lot of success right… now that you've enabled it. If you want, just upload one document for you to test it out, right? Right? And, you know, you can like query it to see what the results are like.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Okay. So I've got to go through here. Let's see technical guides.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  It has to be a word doc. Okay. It can't be a.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It can be word, PDF, text, docx, right?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  I think these are Google docs. So that's why?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that it can be dot docx. Itis the Google doc format should be supported. Do you get an option to like upload it? Let?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Me, see here we go. Okay. Let me try. Okay. So let's say decommissioning, add… to shared inbox. I'm.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  gonna tie it to an inbox where you can test it out as well. Okay, just give it a bit, right? Give it a bit. We'll just see if it's uploaded first. Can you refresh as well?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  If you don't mind, yeah, it's gonna kick you out. So we'll have to take you back to the AI settings. Again. I'll… hang around just to see if the document was recognized to begin with. Yeah.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Because if it recognizes it, then we're good to go. We're in a good spot, then I can do some uploads but maybe not just 10 minutes, so.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. What I'd also recommend is considering these are Google doc as well, right? Would you go to the Google drive and then try downloading it as a different format? Yeah… open any document from here like, yeah, whenever you're ready. Sorry.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Decommission there?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We go. No, can you actually pop it open like open it up? Double click, yeah, and then click on file and download or export as, yeah, that one. Yeah… docx, a PDF is mostly standard, right? Just wait for it to get done. All right. Perfect. Now, can we go back to hiver again? Then… let's try uploading this one?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It will continue and… all right. All right. Looks like it's still gonna take a bit so far. Let's give it maybe 10, 15 minutes and I know we're coming up on time that we've got scheduled as well. So, let's do one thing, right? I know we, that you wanted to like quickly chat about, the automation piece as well. Let me look at your success manager's calendar so I can make sure she's part of the next call too. What does your schedule look like for Wednesday at between one 30 to two PM eastern?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Let's see. Yeah, yeah, I'm free.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Let me just tentatively book us for another 30 minutes on Wednesday.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Two main agenda points would be, you know, one would be the automation. I'll try to see if there's any additional workarounds or something that's worked for other customers there. If not, we'll use that time to get, the co pilot, you know, started at least for you. And then, you know, we can show you like a quick demo, show you some suggestions or you can tell us here. I tested this. It works. It doesn't work if you have any feedback by then.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Right. Gotcha.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that way we can use that time for either or both of these topics and we can see what that falls out like. And if it makes sense, we can also start discussing commercials in terms of, I can send you what a quote in terms of the pricing would look like. And we can see if that makes sense as well for like an upgrade across the board, you know, for the advanced.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  So, this AI portion is it's an add on top of, but the usual pro and elite accounts, like, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So to clarify, the AI is a separate add on 20 dollar per user per month across the irrespective of which plan you're on AI in terms of as a whole feature suite will be a paid add on.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Got it. Okay. So I'll definitely need to get that approved on of.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. And to clarify, just like with hiver as a platform, AI as well will have to be enabled for or at least purchased in terms of licensing for all the team members on hiver.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Okay. Yeah, right. Right. Yeah, yeah, makes sense.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Yeah.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  I.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  was.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  just hoping that it would be so I can't go to this link. Now. I was hoping it would be on a per user basis just so like some of us can start using it. But yeah, I'll take a look, see if it's you know, I think half of the problems would be solved if I had that feature just that's like one of our main ones, the time elapsed feature. But yeah, if you guys have a workaround that would be great for the AI portion. Yeah, obviously, I'm interested, I'll take a look at whatever you have, and then maybe I'll bring on mo if we really like it. He's he's my program director. So he kind of makes the final decisions on these updates and all of that stuff.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Makes sense. And the last bit of confirmation I want to leave you with our thought is that as you would have noticed during renewal, we are open to being flexible on pricing if it does come down to, you know, just the price point and everything else makes sense. Right? While it might not be a significant discount looking at the number of people you have on hiver, I'm sure we can work something out when it comes to AI as a separate add on, meaning you don't necessarily need to be looking at 20, it could be reduced by a few dollars if it helps. Got.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  It. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, perfect. All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. For now, I think I've just sent over the invitation. Can you confirm that you've got it?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Let's.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  see Wednesday November twelfth?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yep, yes, sir. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Peaceful. All right. So, let's leave it with that for now. Tentatively good to go there. Your success manager has closed out for the day. So, I'm gonna check in with her as soon as she starts on Wednesday, and if the timing doesn't match with her schedule, we'll just move it around a bit on either Thursday or Friday and the two talking points on the agenda would be AI and advanced automations in terms of this specific trigger or the specific action you're trying to accomplish. Yeah.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yep. Sounds good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. Anything else for me before we drop off?

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  No, I think I've bothered you enough for today. I.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let you go. Enjoy the Toronto winter. My brother just called me yesterday and he's like it's biting cold in Vancouver, so I'm not even gonna ask how cold it is for you, but I'll let you go snuggle and get ready for your day.

Arfath Hussain (ahussain@montgomerytech.net):
  Yeah. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Take it. Bye.
