================================================================================

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, good morning, val. How you doing?

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Morning, man. Good. How about you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good. Let me just pull this up real quick.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Sure.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Now, Lisa and Ray may not. Oh, Lisa's here. Ray won't be able to join us. He has zanspell at the moment.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No problem. Hi, Lisa.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  How you doing?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good. How's the time change treating everybody today?

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  It's fine. How about you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's okay.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  I mean, I liked having an extra hour. It's so funny, they're like, oh, you get an extra hour of sleep? No, I didn't get an extra hour of sleep, but I did like getting an extra hour like to the day.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then now it's just, it's dark early.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yeah, it's just dark early. Yeah, I know. I just got off a call where someone was like, you know, cue the seasonal, what's it called seasonal affectation disorder or higher rates of depression because you can't sleep earlier?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, it's hard to complain in southern California about weather.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yeah, no, it is for sure. But val is in the Philippines and you don't do changing cloud?

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  No, we don't but obviously, I've had to adjust mine for our team, but, you know, pretty used to it by now. Yeah.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  And I said, to… my God, I forgot.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Andrew.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Who is the Guy that, who's foster, Andrew… that like I'm fine. If you wanted to just keep your hours the same and we're off by an hour, but it's.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  up to you. Yeah, yeah, sure. Thank you. So, Matthew… so so far, all the stuff that you showed Lisa and I, during your previous call have worked out really well. Honestly, I don't have, any additional concerns or questions at the moment. I've been using it pretty regularly efficiently, I would say in the past week, Lisa, I think really, what needs to happen is we need to sit down, you and I need to sit down with Ray and Ken, and then internally deliberate. And because I have a few ideas that I'd like to discuss internally with you and Ray to see how we could even, or how we could leverage this tool even more. And then if you guys have any ideas or any questions, I'd also be happy to work with you through that. But as far as, any, like questions or any additional information that we would need that I would need at least for my end to, further, implement this. I think I'm good for the moment.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  I didn't use it at all last week. And actually, now, I'm having trouble, I'm doing that really. Oh, is it off now? Like, did you turn it off?

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Cause.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  I don't even see it, sometimes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  If you like restart your computer, it'll log you out. So maybe just, you need to maybe give your browser a, refresh here Lisa?

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yeah, I just hit refresh… I don't see it that's so strange.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Can I let me share my screen?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, share your screen?

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  And honestly, like, I didn't use it at all last week. I was out sick and I was working, but I was sick, but that's not really the reason why I just had other stuff going on. Wait, hold on. Let me… catch the call. Okay…

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  I saw it because I was like that.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Oh, sorry… allow zoom to share your screen. I got to open settings really.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Oh, okay.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  We're privacy and security, zoom. All right, turned it on. You use password. Oh, my God.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  I,

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  I got to quit it and reopen it so you may lose me, but I'll be back.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. No problem.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  And, and Matthew, just to give you some context, man, basically, what I did from my end was just to implement the things that we talked about during a previous call. So, I created a views for both Lisa and Ray. So it's more convenient for them. You know, how, that way when we close, the ticket still shows up, on that particular view. So, I had that implemented. And I also created tags, for like the common, I would say, concerns general concerns, that we got regularly. So, those are already in place. Lisa, you're sharing your screen now, right?

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yeah. Okay. So, here's my Gmail and it used to be like, you know, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We're seeing your, calendar here, you want to go to your Gmail, your email, no?

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  I, I'm in my email. Okay. You know, what it is? It's like I'm on two different, it's sharing, my other monitor, which I'm sure how I can, let me just move this over to the monitor.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There we go.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Where is it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Click, click that, the honeycomb button right… there. Yeah, click that next to it, the hiver, honeycomb, right next to it. Yeah, click that. There we go. You got to log back in.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Got logged out.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There you go. There it is.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Okay. So, okay. So, what do I have assigned? So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. If you click on the content ops folder there, yep. Perfect.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yep. Okay. So.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  And,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I think val also mentioned he made a view for you too. So we can also get that view for you?

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  So, do we only have these five emails right now?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Is that it, these are five? These are five emails that are assigned to people and they are also in the open status.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  But like, so, val, in the in, since last week, how many emails have we received or is it that we've received a lot more emails, but only five are assigned?

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Are assigned. Yes.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  So, what? So, is it? Because the other ones are for, so, what's happened to the other ones?

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  So, the other ones don't necessarily need to be assigned to anyone mainly because majority of them are like automated emails or the emails that we get, whenever a channel sends a connection request. Yeah. So there's only.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Five meeting actions. Yeah. Okay. And so they're assigned to, how do I see? Oh, val?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And if you see on the, if you see on the left there too, Lisa, it also shows one with you, and then four of them are assigned to val.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yeah, yes, you know. So val, none have been assigned to Ray?

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  No, no. And to be fair, so Ray has not yet been able to work through this but none, no emails have ever gone in, that are required to be assigned to him. So.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  He was never able to actually get hiver working.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  I don't believe he has, yes.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  So, I wonder if that was a glitch or that was just him not having time to.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  I believe it was just him not having time but, sorry, just, on this point right here. And then, I believe this is like a focal point that we need to touch on internally as well. So, if, again, if you take a look at the emails there, we only have five that are assigned mainly because those are the only emails that are required to be assigned to like myself or to you, right? On my inbox right now, and I haven't been able to sift through this yet. So, a lot of the emails came in during the weekend or after hours. I have like 51 emails unread but like I said, a lot of these are mainly automated. And so, the important ones are just those five based on what I reviewed last Friday, oh.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  I see 35 unassigned.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Yep.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  So, you'll see a lot of those, no reply connect? Yeah.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yeah, they're like automated, but then there's a bunch from Karen Clark. And.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Then if there's no action required on these ones, val, you can just move them to the close status and that will move them out of this view as well.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Yep.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  I think my question, val is, you… know, or like, are 95 percent of the emails going to be dealt with by you? In which case, like assigning them isn't really helping us that much.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  To be completely honest, that's actually what we're seeing right now. And this was something that I discussed with Ray last week. Yeah. When we think, on Friday, where in, last week was just like a real world scenario for our setup. Yeah, because throughout the week I was looking for, I was waiting for emails to come in that I could actually assign to, but only one came in, yeah, that required to be assigned.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  And so then, so what are the… what's the value? I guess, does it help you manage your work better? And as we scale, obviously, that's what I'm thinking about this for, I started on hundreds of channels, because this is, it's not going to be an easy sell, to Mike. He's being very cost conscious right now. So I just need to make sure I have a very strong value proposition for Mike.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Sure, sure. So I… and that's the reason why I also wanted to sit down with you and Ray and even Ken internally so that I could hear from your end, but honestly, from my end, Lisa.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  I.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  don't necessarily see a lot of value that we could leverage at this point. And Matthew, this is also so you're fully aware from your end, in terms of content operations and onboarding channels, there's not really a lot that I need to be assigning to people. Yes, I'll be the one operating this platform and managing this tool.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  But based on like even just last week, there's not a lot of need for it at the moment, unless, of course, if we say, you know, we're scaling in a month or so, where we actually deal with, I don't know 100 more emails. And even at that, right? Even if let's say on a regular basis, 100 emails come in two days, it still is not a situation for us to be able to fully leverage this unless I'm handing over emails to multiple departments, in which case, or, in this case, that's not really where we're at yet.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yeah, I think that's what that was my big question was. You know, I think I thought there was more handoff between you and, but what about mark and Nick?

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Well, sorry, go ahead.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  No, that's my question like, so we, so matt, we've got, you know, two other people, who respond to these emails. And so, I thought there was more assigning or more multiple people handling these emails.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  So to give you some context on that, as you recall, I did actually sync up with them last week. So, we got on a call and worked through some processes, that we could further improve. And even with a streamlined guys, it's not necessarily assigning things over to them Lisa. Because as you know, they are also in this content ops, alias.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yeah.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  It, it's really a matter of, mark and I, and even Nick to a certain extent discussing on slack whether, or not, you know, I need to take it or they need to take it because like the ball's still in their court. So, when a email comes in, unless it's absolutely, let's say obvious that, that's for the streamlined guys, then only then would I be assigning it over to them. And, and even at that, even when cases like that were present where an email comes in and it's definitely for the streamlined guys, they're pretty quick to respond to it. Yeah.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  It's not like we're waiting.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  For that chasing them up exactly.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yeah, right.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Okay. All right. Go ahead. Yeah, and I know.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Matt, this is probably something you want to hear. And I am, you know, I am, and the true value is in, when you've got a team that's managing and there's multiple people and you want to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. But if it is 95 percent, if not more, one person, then the value is more, so helping. I mean, helping you, val, just because you still see the metrics, right? You still see what you need to act on, you still monitor lead time, but it really would be primarily for you to make sure the work is getting done in a timely manner.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Yep. And even at that, I've already created a system, personally that allows me to do that, without, hiver. So, when Ray and I were talking about this last Friday, the biggest function that we could really leverage right now is the first response time and, and even that we could do manually for now, I guess honestly, had it been a situation where we were let's say a support team or a customer service team where we needed to absolutely respond straight away, and track metrics, and only then, would be able to leverage this.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Yeah. So, it sounds like things aren't falling through the cracks. We are responding in a timely basis. We have those mechanisms in place, yeah.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Okay.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  But, but again, sorry, that's just me and my understanding, from my perspective, unless you or Ray or Ken, well again.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  It's sort of, it's really, you are the primary user. I did for myself want to make sure that I wasn't losing track of the emails that were on my plate. You know, I could envision as the scale grows, it will become more of an issue, right?

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Yep.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Just trying to think it is good to see the metrics.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  What is the, where is that the reporting about? If I wanted to say like, so, what is our average response time?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Underneath where it says tags on the left, is the analytics?

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Oh, let me see. I need to do that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then from here, you can select the timeframe, in the upper right corner where it says like 28 October or actually, if you just hit back here… at, the, time where it says 28 October, upper, right? Oh, oh, yeah. This is where you can select like, what you want the data to be from? Is it like the last 30 days, last seven days? Oh, got it. Yeah, just select last 30 days here. And then you wanna, on the left hand side where it says reports, click on users.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  And,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  if you scroll down, it's gonna show things such as average first response time, average response time.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And since it's just got connected, right? And there's not many emails here, you know, there's not much data to go off of quite yet.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  What's the difference between average first response time and then average response time… and then average resolution time is time to close?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah, time to close. Yeah, and,

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  So, I believe the difference there between these two metrics, Lisa, the average first response time counts like the initial reply that we send out, whereas the average response time just counts all the other replies that we interact with that email?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep, that's correct?

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, then if you hit conversations again, the conversations report on the left side and then scroll down. Yeah, this is where you'll see it like this is like accumulation of the mailboxes, times, response times, et cetera.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  And so, does this look right to you, val, is it taking a day to, and this is also including the auto emails that we just.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  Yeah. So, I wouldn't say that these metrics, are accurate mainly because there are, as you saw, there are a lot of auto generated emails that I just need to clean out. So, and that is included here, but I would say I, so, the way I go through my emails, Lisa, is, I, obviously, I time block my time because of the work that I do on onboarding and the logo edits. So, I check on my emails like every two hours and I also have my alerts on. So, if I see something that requires, an urgent response, then I respond to it. The only time where there's a bit of delay is when I'm waiting for information from either Ray or yourself, or Ken or whoever.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  Okay. Right. So, I think where we are then, is, if we get, to the point in time where we have a lot more people that need to actively respond as opposed to the bulk being on val, this… could be more useful for us. I mean, val, would you say that your overall like it's helpful? It's just right now since it's mostly you, it's not helpful or do you have other feedback?

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  No. So, I actually really liked a platform, based on the testing that I did last week, it's just the lack of a need really, again… we do get a lot of emails but a lot of those emails are being handled by myself and not necessarily something that we need to assign to you, or Ken. And, and, I thought about like, you know, the coming months, and essentially how we're going to evolve even the emails that I'm assigning to you now, Lisa, I could take, I could take care of potentially in the future because really, all they, are the responses that's the only reason why I need to assign them to you because we haven't figured out yet. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. So, yeah.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  I mean, there will be, there will be times, again, like I do envision a time where more… a more unique response will be needed. It can't be boilerplate. It will actually be interacting with, you know, the client.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  We.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  still have that now. So, I think so, I think that, where we are, is we're going to table this? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No problem. I makes complete sense. You know, makes complete sense. And, yeah, like you said, maybe down the road, as you guys grow when there's more of a need to allocate work to each other and get more visibility into these things then we can revisit it down the road. So, but yeah, we really appreciate, you know, your time and giving it a try and spending time with us. That was, that was really gracious of you. So, yeah, and no problem at all. And again, yeah, we can just revisit this, down the road, okay?

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  That sounds good. And so then, to deactivate it and to just get it off of our, you know, user interface and val, so we can just deactivate it. We're not like,

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  we can't interrupt you at all, right? Yes. Yeah, absolutely. Okay.

Lisa Hochberg (lisa@orka.tv):
  So, what would we do so that we get it off of our interface?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you should be able to just uninstall it. Let… me see here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Interesting enough. I've never uninstalled hiver in my life, so I.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  believe.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's just in it's, probably just in like, oh, in your manage extensions actually. So, if you click on the extension button in the upper right, it's like that puzzle piece. Yeah, extension button extension. So, you know, up top, Lisa, where it says work and it has the purple icon, yeah, to the right, purple icon, far right? And it says work. Oh, work. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So, to the left of that tool icons, to the left where it's like a puzzle piece, there you go exactly and you're going to click manage? Oh, yeah. Click that three button. Actually, you might be able to do it that way. Yeah, remove from Chrome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  A roof… don't report us for abuse… of course… we're sad to see you go blah blah… as the eon included, wait, what am I doing here? This… is just, this is just feedback I believe. So, yeah. Okay. There you go. Yeah… it's not that they don't I think it's other honestly, it's more like we just don't yeah, it's timing. Yeah, the need… and speaking of which, Lisa, I think that when let's say we launch the product, the app and like the main platform and if let's say we have like a support team in place and maybe.

Val Arellano (valarellano@orka.tv):
  then we can find a better use for this and really leverage it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. And then if you go back to your Gmail here, it should be gone. I think it's gone fantastic. That was. Okay. Thank you so much. Yeah, and like, yeah, we'll just keep this. I'm glad we piloted it and we'll just keep it in mind and, you know, valve you, if you feel like, yeah, I'm going to be the biggest judge or actually or not just, I mean, me too, right? If I find that like, wait a minute. Did we risk? Cause that's what really prompted me in the first place was just, did this get a response yet? I'm not sure someone's looking on this, I don't know, right? But if I have that confidence that everything is being tackled including myself, right? Like, do I need to respond to this? So as long as we find that we're doing that effectively, you know, we're okay, and that starts to go off the rails, we'll need better management. Yes. Yeah, I agree. Definitely, I was going to say, yeah, I, yeah, we're all set here. Feel free to reach out to me in the future, when that time comes, but yeah, really, thanks again for taking the time and the consideration and I wish you guys all the best. Thank you so much. Thank you man. All right. Thanks, Lisa. Bye.
