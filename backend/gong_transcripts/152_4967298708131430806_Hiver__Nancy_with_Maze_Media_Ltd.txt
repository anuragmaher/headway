Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Nancy, can you hear me?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Hi, yes, I can.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hey, how are you doing?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  I'm good. Thank you. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Doing good. I'm doing good, just dealing with a bit of cough and cold. So, just wanted to put a name to the face and a face to the name. I'm going to go with you off shortly to make sure you don't see me with a box of tissues. But, hi, I'm Raghav, I'm going to be chatting with you today. Pleasure meeting you. Okay, great.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Yeah. And you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, Nancy, I mean, I've been with the hiver business for about eight years, worked with quite a few of our customers during my time here, and I understand that you're interested in exploring our AI suite of functionality, you know, on the hiver side of things specifically from the meeting invite, it looks like you're interested in the tagging co, pilot and the sentiment piece of things.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Yeah. I have to say, I don't know loads about any of those things. So, I just thought I'd tick them all because I just thought it'd be good to be aware of the functionality that it could offer if we were to like perhaps upgrade.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely, no for sure. And, you know, looking at the way your hiver account is set up, looks like you also have like three different businesses or like domains that you operate out of for hiver as well.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Oh, okay. We only use it in one department at the moment, but I think we have like an accounts inbox set up for it and a main inbox set up for it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So, I've also got fluential co UK and optimized with a y co UK as well. Oh.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Okay. Yeah. We're all part of the same group.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, got. it. Got it. All right. That makes sense. And it does look like the general theme for which you're using hiver is finance and accounts as a whole. So curious, you know, in terms of the AI functionality on hiver, we've got like quite a few moving pieces that I'd be glad to show you a quick overview of what they are before we get into that. What does AI adoption or AI readiness look like for you as a business especially in the department that you work with in?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Well, it's something that we're kind of working or have worked with for a long time. Well, right from inception, we're a marketing agency. So we're very aware of AI and its capabilities and how we can use it to kind of work with it within the agency as opposed to against it. So, yeah. So I'm just thinking of it from an automation point of view, in terms of how our team works, is there ways in which we can be more efficient with our systems basically in our processes?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood. All right. So what I'm going to do now is do a little bit of show and tell, I'd like for you to jump in whenever you have a question or you need specific clarifications. Yeah, I'm guessing you can see my screen going by the nods as well. So, you know, when it comes to the general AI perspectives on hiver or features on hiver, we're effectively looking at it from two broad categories to start with we're calling one of that an AI agent which is going to be more operational in terms of everyday automations, task creation and effectively making the working within hiver easier for your agents on hiver. And then the other side of it is the AI co pilot and that's going to be more of a collaborative assistant that would help you with the responses that your team needs to send out, right? The stuff that goes out to the clients that you serve. So, in terms of the feature sets within both of these right now, current capabilities are standing at tagging sentiments and an automatic thank you detector that pretty much closes out emails as the three main features on the AI agent route. And because this theme here is more from an automating stuff operationally driving for efficiency. The tagging piece is something that a lot of finance teams on hiver have taken a liking to. And we've got the tagging out on hiver on like early beta and early trial for our customers. Since July, this year, we've had some of our largest finance department customers leverage this. They've seen a lot of success. And so bless you. And so, the way we've got this set up is the AI model on hiver that works in the background would effectively start learning from your training. So, the first step here is you as a team decide what kind of categories should the AI be used for? The difference from having a typical workflow that's keyword based to letting AI take over on the tagging front, is that you're now able to cost a very wider net instead of saying hiver, look for the word refund, remittance, invoice, and then tag it as invoice. Instead of being as laser focused as that through the AI learning perspective, you're now able to be more generic for lack of a better way of saying it, right? You're able to say, hey hiver. If somebody says I need help with my credit card bill, that could also mean a payment related question or to transpose that into your scenario, it could mean if somebody says refund, charge back, both of that needs to be classified into refunds or send money back to the customer that's a general category. So the way you'll be setting it up is we've given you that first step which is the training which is the most crucial aspect, full control over to you as the team member on hiver. So you would pretty much start by telling hiver here's the tags or the categories I'd like for you to start working on. And for each of these categories, here's, 10 examples that I've manually chosen that would give you a full scope understanding. And this 10 emails could be from the past active emails as of today, completely up to you. And what you're effectively doing here is giving the AI tagging element that wider net like what's the highest, what's the lowest, what's the most precise as well. Once you feed it 10 emails, what it'll do is it'll basically train itself and generate a prompt. And this is where a little bit of prompt engineering like your typical chatgpt gemini experience would pretty much come in handy. So based on the default prompt that hiver's AI generates, those would be the scenarios where that tag is added. In this case, a refund tag. For example, now, if you feel like your prospects, your clients typically use other words or there's additional scenarios you'd like for this refund tag to be covering, feel free to play with the prompter. Include that. And that way as you keep tweaking it as it goes, it both learns better from usage and also from the prompts getting better.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Okay. So each time say an email came into the inbox that was then relevant to a tag we had set up. We could then apply that tag to it and it would continue its sort of learning around the language and stuff within the emails. Is that right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So anytime you see a non standard email that falls under a category, you can come back here and be like train that here or additionally, you can just play with the prompts and have that included there both options. Now, the outcome here is on a daily basis. Once it's enabled, it's trained and it's got like the white cast net ready. It's basically going to start tagging these emails as they enter your inbox. So the moment email comes to your inbox, if the AI recognizes that it's billing, it's going to have, if you notice this, there's going to be that little sparkle that tells you, hey, this is why AI has tagged it as billing. It's going to give you a short description that tells you the reasoning behind the model and like I said, if you feel this is right or wrong report and then the model starts getting better with usage, right?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  And you also set who it then assigns that to like automatically, definitely, ah, okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So that's the AI automation part of it. So once the tag is added, you can pretty much set up any kind of automation workflow that you want to. And that could be, if a certain tag is added, I want the email to be reassigned to somebody starting with something as straightforward as that, going all the way down to, hey, if there's an invoice number on any of these emails that I receive, extract that invoice number, add it as a hybrid note right down to that.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  That's so clever.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, it can even do things like, for instance, some of our customers in the finance space, want leadership to be notified, want the team managers to be involved. If there's like a really high flagging kind of mechanism happening, you know, it's a big dollar value, big ticket, number, things like that. So a lot of those elements could also be used. And the workflow here doesn't just stop with assignments. It can reprioritize that email. If you've got that kind of configuration going, it can send out a template of response for that specific scenario saying, hey, I'm part of the leadership team here. I understand that you've got this reported to us. Rest assured. We're working on this as top priority. We'll get back to you within 24 hours, you know, just to give that kind of handholding experience or that white glove experience, right? So that's the kind of automation rules you can create basis the AI, adding a tag as the first step. Now, the next element here is the sentiment analysis and that's a straightforward three or five point scale where hiver's AI is able to understand the sentiment based on the tonality verbiage and any existing conversations with that person on that same thread. It's going to give you these little pop up emojis, if I can call it that on the screen. And this is more of an ongoing metric as well. So if somebody writes in, say, hey, I've been reaching out to your team five days. Nobody's given me an update on a refund. Then, you know, that's a little emoji is going to be like, hey, this looks like a negative sentiment. This person might not be happy, right? And you're able to track that from inception to completion. So first email, somebody's pissed off lost email. They're really happy going out to the conversation. You're able to even track that whole journey. So from a finance team perspective, these sentiments could also be used to trigger workflows, notifications, reassignments, templated emails going out to the clients, right? And the last part which is what ties all of this together. The piece to resistance is the co pilot as a whole. Now, this one is going to be an extension of your hybrid usage and that's more work in progress where it learns from how your team does it. As of today, current state, what it can do is basically work based on the knowledge sources that you're able to feed into the co pilot. So instead of going and training something like a gemini or a chatgpt, with repeated questions and tonalities and screenshots and stuff like that. You're able to do one of two things today, right? Upload a bunch of your processes, your refund policies, how you'd handle a certain scenario, things like that, either as documents, PDF, docx, word, all of those are supported or you can have small little snippets. So, if Raghav and your team addressed a customer that was pissed off about a refund in a very great way and the information there is not part of a typical process document, but you'd feel like, hey, this could be useful for other team members. In a similar scenario, you can just copy paste that information as a snippet or if there's like certain small process changes that don't warrant a full update, but would still be useful for the team. They could all be added as basically short paragraphs, small bullet points, things like that.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Right. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Additionally, do you have your like, do you have any of your processes and sops kind of listed out on confluence notion? Something like that?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  We do have some process documentation that's just on like a word doc. And we also have like email templates and stuff that we've used that we use in response to certain emails. And what have you. So that would probably work.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Precisely. Yeah. So from that perspective, you could either have that word doc, pretty much just copy pasted as a hiver knowledge base, an internal knowledge base. So that becomes your team's repository on hiver. Connect that to the co pilot or the ask AI. And effectively, once you've got all these knowledge sources, training the hiver AI model on a daily basis, here's, what the everyday experience would look like. I'm a member of your team. I go in, I see an email assigned to me, pop it open. All I need to do is again sparkle icon, click on that and I'm going to be able to do quite a few things, right? Firstly, I'm going to be able to see, do I want to draft a reply to this question or do I want a summary of what's happening so far? So if there's like four or five emails that get reassigned to you, for example, you don't need to read the whole thing to understand what's happened so far. You can be like, hey, hiver summarize what's happening. It tells you very clearly and in a more contextual manner than a gemini or a chatgpt, say, hey here's. The issue here's. What your team's done so far. Here's, the current status. And here's what the AI model thinks should be a next step. The next step is mostly reliant on the kind of knowledge and articles that you've uploaded to hiver, right? As an outcome of this, what you can do is you can be like, hey, at this point, I want to draft a reply talking about refund policy. And again, it's all going to be reliant on having the right information on the co pilot. But as long as that's there, AI is going to be able to not just give you a generic response like you normally get, but a more driven and accurate response that ties in straight to the email and the question that you've got in front of you and the process that you've got uploaded on the packet. And as an agent, this means I don't need to check multiple places, command F, search into a box, upload the document. Every time I want to reply. I get this uploaded here. My team's taking care of it. So I just need to go here, type out what I needed to give me or help me with it's. Going to give you a reply that you can insert one click that becomes ready to be sent out, right?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Okay. All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right future status, we are aiming to have, you know, this AI ask AI piece, be able to give you a pre drafted response, ready to go. Your team can review and send it out and that's in like, you know, the coming quarters. We're looking at having it ready to that stage, current state. We've tested it out extensively and it's going to be able to fetch any kind of information from uploaded knowledge sources and help the agents reduce the time when it comes to having to reference 10 different places to get a reply sorted out. Right? Okay. So together these three are the main elements of the hiver's AI perspective. Additionally, for a finance team like yours or a finance department on hiver, the AI extract within the automation workflows would be an added advantage, right? Where basically you're saying, hey, if there's a new email I receive, in this case, I've based it on subject or body. But depending on the examples we've gone by so far, we can be like, you know, if the tag because if we've got AI tagging enabled, you know, then tag to an extent could be used as a condition as well. But essentially what you're saying is, hey, when a tag is added, if the tag is refund, for example, then I want hiver to extract search from the body and the subject and extract the invoice number. And at every stage, you're able to train the AI saying, hey here's the pattern or the nomenclature of my invoice numbers. I get, you know, based on that, it's going to be able to fetch that number, pop it in as a hiver note if you'd like to. So that way it's easier to quickly reference when you're transacting on a lot of emails or set up a workflow as well that does a few other actions on the outset of things, right? Okay. So together those are the four major elements of ais that's out today on hiver. As of today, on the immediate roadmap, we've got a QA that's going to be launching in the next two weeks and that would make it easier for team members to have response drafting done even more simpler. So, instead of relying on pre created templates, there will be like an AI bot of sorts like an AI, sorry, wrong term. There'll be an AI element added there. So that when somebody says, write a reply… for instance, you know, reply is saying good to go. And as an agent, I just need to write this out. And then I'll have the relevant controls with pop ups saying, make it professional, you know, write it, better rewrite it and that then makes the replying angle more easier, right? So full picture, those are the four major elements of the hiver AI that's active out and a lot of our customers are exploring today. There's QA, a couple of other smaller elements like there's another summarizer here that does a similar job just that you can add it as a note. So it does like quick little bullet points, just straightforward condensing the information so far without next steps without what's happened so far, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Things like that. So, yeah, I mean, what do you think about these, the features that you have seen so far from an AI perspective? Do you see them being useful? What does that look like?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Yeah, definitely. I could see how they could be applied to how we use it at the moment and then well, for more efficiency really and to save time, it would depend on whether or not we would want to pay, you know, the extra monthly fee per user at this point in time. But do, is it see because I've come on the meeting from like having the last chance to kind of get a free trial on it. Does it, is that still available to have? Or am I too late for that one?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, I can definitely have that trial enabled for your account. We typically offer like a one week trial but, you know, what I'd like to do is considering we've just got it talking. I'll have a two week trial enabled for your team, which basically means after today's call, I'll go back to my team, have it enabled, send you an email once it's done, and we can have that trial active till the twentieth of November, pretty much two weeks.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Oh, that would be great because it would give us some time to actually use it in practice and see if it actually kind of benefits us or how we find it, which would be really good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. So next steps from me and Nancy, I'll work with my team, have the trial enabled, shoot out an email once it's ready. And if I'm able to do it today, I'll keep the trial till the twentieth. If it goes out till tomorrow, then I'll keep it till the 20 first, essentially two weeks of proper testing time for you. I'll include the pricing information on what the add on is priced at. And I want to let you know that if you're ready to move ahead before the end of the month, I would be able to work in like a small discount just to make that price increase easier. Okay?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  And if, because we're going to go ahead with a free trial, do I have to then like cancel it so that we don't get billed going forward or do I have to then physically sign up and update the billing information? Do you know what I mean?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. So at this stage, I'd appreciate a quick little check in call. I was thinking, you know, maybe we can have something on the calendar for like the week of the November twentieth, maybe a day or two before. So that way I can gather some feedback if it works, and we're just looking at commercials.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We can talk about a discount price, something. I can send that over if you're not interested. We'd still love the feedback as we continue developing it with a paid angle. All feedback helps us as we develop that as well. So on that front, do you think, you know, the eighteenth or the nineteenth of November looks good? Same time or?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Year? Yeah, let me just have a look at my calendar.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Yeah, I can do the eighteenth.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Same time.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  At three 30? Yeah, that would be fine.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Brilliant. So I'll just shoot over a tentative invite for the eighteenth at three 30. I'll send over materials and recording of this video as well and a final confirmation once the trial is enabled, right? And I'd love to keep the channel open. So if you have any questions or doubts on, hey, can this do this? Can we tweak it a bit so it can achieve this outcome for me, feel free to keep them, you know, feel free to send them over to me or email. We'll keep chatting on that front. Yeah.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Okay. Brilliant. Thank you very much.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, Nancy. One last question before I let you go being a finance team, what's your ERP or finance software that you use?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  At the moment, it's zero, but we're about to move over to sage.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, sweet. All right. It's pretty interesting. You know, I used to work with zoho books when I started my career about like 15 years back, zoho books and zoho invoices. So, I've heard of zero and sage and like quickbooks and stuff. But really the reason why I asked is we've got a Netsuite integration. I wanted to just see if that is a software that you use as a business?

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  No, it isn't at the moment, and I'm not sure it'd be of interest because we're literally now just kind of set everything up to make the shift to sage. Got it. Yeah, that makes sense. I'll say no on that one.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Well, Nancy, thank you so much for your time. It was a pleasure catching up and hope you have a good week.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Thank you. Thanks very much. Take.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  care.

Nancy Barnard (nancy@mazemedia.co.uk):
  Bye.
