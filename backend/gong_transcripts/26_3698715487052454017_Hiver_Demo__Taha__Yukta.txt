Home:
  yeah. Hello. Hey, how are you doing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, I'm good. Is this Taha?

Home:
  Imran? Yes, Taha. Imran, I'm really sorry that actually I missed the reminder. So I'm really sorry that I have joined that much late. I'm really sorry about that. No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries at all. Shall we get started with the discussion? Yes?

Home:
  Exactly.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Then. Thank you firstly for scheduling this with us. My name is yubta and I'll be helping you with the evaluation. So before anything, I would just want to understand what made you look out for a tool like hiver, if you could just give me a little brief on that, I think we can then tailor the conversation accordingly.

Home:
  Actually, I've been working with a company called wynnex global. It's a recruitment agency working in the UK and we have been running the operation from office and I'm from the team of wynnex global as a helpdesk. I'm a member of helpdesk, and we are having issues to sort our inbox because most of the communications are happening through emails with the contractors with the clients. So that is the reason we are receiving the work orders from the clients and assigning it to our engineers. So we are scheduling each and everything is happening through emails. So that is the reason we were looking for some sort of because I've been using outlook the basic email platform. So, there are a couple of team members who are using the same email for helpdesk. So we are using to like assign a particular worker for a particular thing. So that is the reason we are looking for some sort of, we can customize the inbox by ourselves and assign the works to a certain member.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So currently, everybody is logging into the same inbox which is helpdesk at the rate. And then that's how you're managing the emails, right?

Home:
  Exactly.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And how many people do we have in this team who are responsible?

Home:
  Six six.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. There are six people, got it. And is this the first time that you're looking out for a solution? Is there been any trigger that made you to look out for a solution at this point?

Home:
  Yes, because a lot of the things, a lot of the things are mixing up like some of the person who's like there's a shift difference by timings. So the person who is not available at the certain time and the email is going like down in the inbox. So the person… who comes in, he forgot to check the email. And most of the time that if the email is sort of important, we have to look after to it and it is not going through.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah, triggered. Yeah, cool. And are you the one who is sort of handling this team? Could you also talk to me about your role a little bit?

Home:
  Yes, actually, I'm not the person who's handling the team because let me just go ahead and we have started the operation from help desk from last two months. Oh, okay. Yes, it's a it's a new team and nobody is a team leader right now. So we are still assigning the works to the simple person. But I was the person who assigned was assigned to attend the meeting from the CEO of the company. So that is the reason I'm here for the discussion. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But ultimately, as the process goes or if you would want to sort of evaluate hiver as one of the tools, then, it will eventually be cleared off by the CEO, right? Exactly. Got it. Cool. No worries. Then what I can do is I can just show you the platform today and we can explore if this is going to solve for what we have just discussed, understanding the pain points that you just laid out. I think hiver could be the right choice for you as it will allow you to be able to streamline the entire function, be able to give ownership to who is working on what, and making sure that nothing slips through the crack. So I'll just share my screen quickly and let me know if you can see it.

Home:
  Yes, I can see the screen.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Great. So just a quick introduction of, hiver is an AI powered customer service tool wherein you log in through using this URL, called app, hiverhq. Com. This is a browser based application. We have a mobile application as well. So you can download that and manage the inbox through your mobile tool. Now, in order to log in here, you will be using your outlook credentials, assuming that in the team, everybody has their own individual email addresses like you do, you will just use them and you will just log in here and you can mark yourself available. And you can also see and everybody can see the team availability at all times. So you like you mentioned the team is working in shifts. So you can always mention yourself online whenever you are available to receive and respond to the emails. And other times, you can just mark yourself away so that everybody is aware and is on the same page. Right? Now, on the left, you see there are two inboxes, you can connect your personal inbox as well. So to avoid going back and forth between your personal outlook account and hiver, you can actually manage your personal inbox as well if you would like, right? So that both things can be managed from one place itself. And then right below it, we have the shared inboxes. So hiver does not just cater to a customer service or a customer support use case. But this can be expanded to other functions as well in the company. As long as there is a generic email address that a lot of people are responsible of taking care of, right? Hence, I'm part of different shared inboxes in my company, which is like finance, HR, operations, sales support for today's, purpose. I'll take an example of this inbox, the support inbox. Likewise, we'll be creating one connecting with the helpdesk email address, so that going forward, nobody has to log in separately to the helpdesk account. All the emails are going to be coming into this central place wherein we will add all six individuals who are managing this or who are responsible. So that everybody can handle or manage this right here. Any question on the setup part before I move forward?

Home:
  Yes. I do have a question like if someone is not in the shift timing, like if I'm running the shift according to the UK time, I'm available from eight a M till five PM. And the person is coming at 11 a. M. And do we have to go ahead and assign the particular task? Like some of the jobs are assigned to me and some of the jobs are assigned to other person who's coming at 11. Do I have to go ahead and manually assign it to them? Or just go ahead and tag them once he comes in. So the task that has been tagged to him or assigned to him, it will show on the top of the inbox when he logged in. I.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Would want to understand like the time shift that you are working on and the emails that you are handling during that time. Would you want to retain those emails to you only once you come back on your shift the next year? Would you want the other team members to then take over as they start working and handle the same emails?

Home:
  No, I'm just saying that let's go with an example, like there are two jobs.

Home:
  One is like in East London and one is in north London. I'm taking care of East London and the other person is taking care of north London. And all the emails coming for East London area are assigned to me. And once they have been, if the emails are coming for north London, I'll just go ahead and simply tag the other team member. Will it go away from my screen or will it be there on my screen? I'm just asking this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So let me just come to that in terms of understanding the workflow from here. So these are the sections that you see that will define your day to day workflow, right? So any new email that comes in or being written at help desk at the rate, you will find them in this section called unassigned. Which means that these are currently unassigned. Nobody has picked these emails up. So that those will reside in this specific section. When you click on any email, you will have this activity panel on the right side of the screen that you see from where you can do or anybody can do multiple things as long as they're part of this inbox. You have this assigning section here which will let you give the ownership as to who needs to work on this email, right? And anybody can do this. So whoever is working in that shift, they can either assign it to themselves. Let's say I am currently working in the East London shift and the email I see here sitting in the unassigned section, I want to pass this to myself. So I will assign this to myself. Once I do that, this activity will be logged in the real time. So you will have all activity logs as to whoever is making any change on any email. We can see it at all times. And once you assign or give the ownership to any email that will be visible in the mind section, that will go to their mind section. So all the emails that you are working on and which are assigned to, you will find them in the mind section here. And for the team's visibility, anybody can go into the team section here and we can see collectively in this inbox, how many open emails do we have today? And how are these distributed, right? So, for example, if Manoj is the one who works in the north London shift, I can still see, okay, he has two open emails that he's working on right now. Those will remain with him as soon as he comes back. The next day, he will pick from where he left. These emails are still going to be assigned to him and he can just pick those up. Nothing's going to be buried anymore into the, at the last of the inbox, because now we are distributing emails to everyone and everyone knows as to what are the emails that are assigned to them, right? So Manoj will come and he would have these emails as it is. If there is a new reply, he will just reply to it and go about it. And if you want to take any email up, it's very easy to reassign those to yourself as well, right? So, for example, if Manoj, has two of such emails that is sitting in his radar and I want to just go into it. I want to pick it up. Someone is writing from north London shift, but I think I can just, you know, answer it right away and close this. I can just go ahead and, you know, reassign that email to myself if I want. And then I can just pick it up and close this for him, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So that then he will be left with only one email. As he comes back today. Tomorrow. He will see the one email that he needs to work on. Does this make sense?

Home:
  One more thing? Yes. I just want to start to cut you off. I just had a question like if you are looking at Manoj inbox and you have opened the email, will it be remain… like marked as unread on Manoj's site? Or will it be marked as read because you have opened the email see?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  In hiver, we will no longer be going with read and unread functionality because multiple people are touching emails and read and unread functionality will not give you the understanding of whether the email has been handled or not. Simply, you will be going by which section the email is sitting in. If it's an unassigned email. That means nobody has been given the ownership to this as long as it's sitting in the mind section. This means that this is the, these are the open emails that I am responsible for and these are assigned to me in order to track the progress on each email. We will be using the status column here in order to understand whether it's an open email. It's in pending or it's closed, which means already been worked on, right? So even if you go and see the email, read it, let's say these are unread emails. I click on it, read it. Unread. It for Alice. Nothing will change, right? She will come. If she has not seen it, she will also see it as unread or if she has seen it, then she will see it as read. Unless you make any changes in hiver from here, let's say I come here and close this ticket. Now, this will be closed for everyone. Alice will no longer be able to see it and it will show only two open emails for her now.

Home:
  Perfect. And we can allow this to change the status only for the certain person. Like I can go ahead. Anybody can update it. Anybody can update the status, right? Yes, yes, perfect. And.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This will be recorded as well. So why everybody is able to assign emails between each other or change the status to just make sure we have enough transparency. And if someone needs to jump in, they can do it without having to bother someone else or ask someone else that I'm doing this. But yes, from the collaboration perspective, if you are looking into someone else's emails and you want to take it up from here, you assign it to yourself, you can always use this note section here. And this is going to be for your internal communication between you. All right? So, for example, I want to work on Alice's email. I come here, I just reply, right? And just send the response. And I think that this is done no long. We don't have to do anything here. I'll just give a quick note to Alice saying that, you know, I have taken care of this, right? Or anything that I need to, right? So that we are always in the loop as well, in case we need to keep in loop, you know, the other person right now, Alice will receive a notification. She will see, okay, you know, Taha has already worked on this email and if she wants to reply, she can further communicate with you or we'll just let it closed. So, this is how the collaboration part will come into the picture, right?

Home:
  Got it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right now, since we are on the status and understanding it. So when you have marked any email as either pending or closed, if you receive any response on that email, right? Since once it's marked pending or closed, you will not find it in the mine or unassigned or team section, those emails will reside under all views in the pending section, the whole pending ones. And then this is where you will find the closed ones wherein your team has already worked on. And if you receive any reply on either of these, they will come back into the mine section again so that you don't have to keep checking if there is any response on these ones, right?

Home:
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got.

Home:
  It. Perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Does your shift query resolve? Like, do you have any question on that? No?

Home:
  No, okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Great. On top of it, I think Taha, you could set up an SLA as well. That is something that you have not mentioned. But in case you want to keep certain timelines and want to have reports whether we are adhering to replying to those emails that are being assigned to a specific person within one hour, two hours, three hours. However you would like, we can actually set up those slas as well so that we are keeping some standard across the team. And you can also categorize your emails into different tags. So like you said, emails are already bifurcated by region by shift. So you can actually create a tag called north, you know, London, East London, so that, you know, any email that comes within this time frame gets automatically tagged as north London, so that, you know, these are the tickets that we have received for this region. And likewise, you can create for other. This is just one example I'm telling you but tags could actually help you sort of categorize your emails into a nice manner so that you have one place to then fetch emails related to one topic.

Home:
  Got it. So I can create the tags by myself. Yeah, they're not something like it is predefined. No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, yeah. You will get a clean slate. You just create tags simply by just naming them and you start applying those to the emails.

Home:
  Perfect. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And we can actually set up certain automations as well, right? So from the admin panel, we don't have to do all of these things manually wherein we are assigning emails manually. We are applying these tags manually. We can always play with the automations create certain workflows, workflow for ourselves. So we can actually do that. So, if an email comes in with a specific subject, any keywords that you would want, you can actually assign those to a specific person in the team. If that person is responsible for that sort of email that is related to any topic or coming from a specific customer. So, we could also, you know, do those automations here, got?

Home:
  It, got it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Apart from this, anything else that you would want me to show you? Do you want to see the analytics part? Are you interested in that? Or do you think this, is, this covers most of what you were looking for?

Home:
  Actually, this covers most of what I was looking for because analytics part, I guess that will be helping our, the person who's running the business, and he's going to have a look on that. I guess he has an idea regarding because I have been using hiver and it's it was like, you can say three to four years back as I have, as I mentioned that this is the new business and I have joined the team around two months back, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Home:
  And so I have been using hiver, actually, I was about to set up a trial version. So… it was not helping me out regarding that because as I was having an user account for outlook. So it was not allowing me to start a free trial. So I can go ahead that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Should, not, do you want to share your screen? Do you want me to help you?

Home:
  Sure. Yeah, sure. And.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Also, which company were you associated with when you were?

Home:
  Using, I couldn't disclose the name. I'm really? Yeah, I'm really sorry about that. No worries at all. So.

Home:
  I guess we'll go with this screen. Can you see the screen, right? Not?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yet?

Home:
  Okay. I guess it will work now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can see it now.

Home:
  I'll go ahead and could.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You just, can you write your own email address? My own? Yeah, instead of the generic one? I think. Okay… yeah, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Permissions requested. I hope this works.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Can you put the phone number from the details? Do?

Home:
  I have to go ahead and put the phone number like the one the,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  one.

Home:
  We are using on the help desk because we cannot, we will not be receiving any one time password. Oh.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, there is no need for any password here. Just, you can just put any number that you feel like… you can search for UK there on top. Just check probably.

Home:
  On the top or right at the bottom, I guess it should be, if it is alphabetical, it should be in the bottom.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I don't see it. Could you just scroll up a little bit? Yeah, there we go. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, this email.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is where you'll put the help desk email address and it's a user account, right? So select the first one. Yeah, fine. Continue… authorize.

Home:
  Still nothing, I think the.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  code will come on the app, right? The authenticator app?

Home:
  Oh, just allow me a moment.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no worries.

Home:
  Yeah, this is the way, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You got stuck here. So what you have to do for this Taha, is you have to go to your it team and they'll have to approve it, approve. Hiver basically to authorize… be authorized as a third party tool that you would like to use or give access to your outlook. So, this is something that needs to be done as a one time thing once that is done from their side, which hardly takes like two minutes. I think you'll be able to then log in here and have that. Can I?

Home:
  Ask my it team to convert the help desk account into the admin account so they can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no, that won't change anything. You would still need admin approval?

Home:
  Admin approval from the person who's handling the domain of wynexglobal. Com.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no. This is like, you know, this is from Microsoft itself. You have to add hiver or give hiver the permission to be used as a third party tool to access your Microsoft. So this is not, this has nothing to do with help desk email address, not being an admin account or anything. This is just for your Microsoft to allow permission to hiver to be for you to be able to use it as a third party tool.

Home:
  This is what I'm asking. Do I have to go ahead and add in our domain? Because this is the domain account that I've been using helpdesk at wynexglobal. Com. Yeah, you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  have to add this. You don't have to add the email address. You have to add hiver as a third party tool.

Home:
  There. Yes. All right. Got it. Yeah. So you,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  can take a screenshot of this, send it to your it team and they can do this for.

Home:
  You, once I was setting it up before the meeting, like on our last working day. So at that time, I was going to go ahead and set up it. So I have already shared this to my it team and I hope they haven't get back to me. So I'll go ahead and talk to them regarding this and I'll set it up once it is set it up. I hope that we do have an online chat support for hiver.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We do have, yeah, we do have chat support. So you can always connect with the support team or I'm happy to connect with you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Again, once this is done, we can have a placeholder for sometime next week, hopefully hoping that by then it will approve this and I can then help you with the further setting up the account and doing different things there. Sure.

Home:
  No problem. Can we go ahead and set up a meeting on Wednesday, the seventh of January at the same time? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That works for me as well. Let's do that connect on Wednesday before that, if anything happens, just let me know and then accordingly, we can make changes there.

Home:
  Perfect. Got it. Let me just go ahead and ping back. Get back to my it team and ask them to add the third party as hiver so we can go ahead and start using it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, let's do that. Perfect. Sa. Anything else that I could help you with today? Not?

Home:
  Right now because it has not been set up yet. Once it is set up, then it will be a great help. So I'll go ahead and set it up first, and then we'll have a meeting on seventh.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, let's do that. Sounds good. Thanks. Thank you.

Home:
  So much.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. Take care. Bye, bye, bye bye.
