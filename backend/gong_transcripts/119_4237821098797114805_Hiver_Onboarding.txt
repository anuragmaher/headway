================================================================================

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  hey, Rakesh. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good afternoon, Tom. I'm good. Thank you. How are you doing?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Thank you for joining in, sir.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  All good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You're all great. All.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Right. Let's get started.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Do you mind sharing your screen? Let me just get you started with hiver, and we're going to be setting up the account and of course, adding your users and as, and when we complete the setup in a day or two, at maximum, we'll be maybe having another meeting with the team so I can train them.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Awesome.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. So, this is going to be the first administrative setup, which is why we don't require the entire team because it's more to do with the setup at the back end and everything. Once we complete it, we'll then invite the team and I'll take care for the entire training and quick team training for the team, right? All right. Great. Now, do you want to take me to WWW? Hiverhq? Com? Sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Could you click on start free trial? Your email address? Continue Google, yes, please email for now?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, before we add this to the Chrome, I want to make sure that you're logged in into your individual Chrome profile. Now, is this your account? Okay? Fair enough. Let's go ahead.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, I think I already have it because I used the trial.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Let's close this one. Go back to your Gmail inbox, please?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Could you click here… login into hyvo… yes, please… continue. And now, we'll be setting up the shared inbox for you? Okay? A little bit about the company?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It's fine. I've got your details, so it doesn't really matter a lot. Okay. Yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Why is the phone number too long? Why is the phone number too long?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, is it because it's a toll free number?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, it is. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  In that case, do you mind if you could put in the office number or your mobile number? We are, anyways, not going to be using it because, yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Oh, it's always saying maximum line numbers.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Could you remove zero as a prefix, please? Oh,

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That should go? Because we are anyways, picking Australia as a country code, so.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Okay. Inquiries.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Connect an email to the mailbox. Now, now, is this inquiries? A Google group inbox? Oh, sorry, user account or a group inbox? Like do you have a password when you log in into inquiries at the rate inbox?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. We have a password. Yeah. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  This is a regular standard Gmail account. Yes, please use another account and put in inquiries at the rate inbox.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, it's hello at.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. I,

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  need to pick this up.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You can stop sharing it's. Fine, sir?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, it's in a different, it's in an excel file. So it doesn't matter. You shouldn't be able to see it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Absolutely. Go ahead and stop sharing the screen and I can stop recording.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Ahem,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  okay. We can do this later anyways. We are going to be taking care of the complete onboarding. So, at the bottom, you see, do this later, okay? And come out for now, skip anyway.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, what you, what I would like to do is first of all, go ahead and delete the demo inbox. So there is a delete option on the first inbox towards the extreme left, yes, please, because we'll be using it. So we don't require a demo inbox, you can type in delete demo. All right. Let's just get rid of extra confusions. Now, close the admin panel. It's fine. It'll go away in a minute or two and let's come back to the main. Okay, fair enough. Let me go ahead and quickly send you a test email. First of all, let's just make sure everything starts to sync. Okay? And then we'll go ahead and set up the different tags, slas, different automation workflows, and help you create certain dashboards for reporting also.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay, cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  For that, let me go ahead and send you hello at thecommons com. Au, okay. Yeah, for cache testing from hiver.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. I think you have started receiving the emails in the mailbox here.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Which meaning from this moment itself, you have all the emails which are coming into, hello inbox, coming into this inquiries inbox as a team. So this is going to be a common, transparent solution where every user will now be added and they'll be seeing new emails, the brand new requests which are unattended coming into the unassigned view. Now, before we even get into it, if you notice the all views section, can you click on, please? All views here. Now, there is a pending and closed bucket. Also, now a couple of my customers would want to see all the pending requests on the phone front page as well as the closed ones. I'll leave it up to you. Do you see that you need to look at those pending requests which are not been done immediately or you want to keep those tickets on hold because you want to work on those tickets later. So you can always star, mark that and look at in the top screen?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. So if I press this star, then it's.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  yeah, it's added to your favorites. And when you close it, it's actually displayed on the main screen for you.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. I got it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, you see this brand new request on the unassigned. When you assign email to yourself, it becomes part of mine. When you assign emails or tickets to your teammates, it becomes a part of team. So all the unassigned mine and team are open requests. By the way people are still working when we choose to keep anything in pending because we want to work on those emails later, goes to pending. And otherwise closed is when you're done resolution and you've closed the ticket?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, correct.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right now, I think I'm giving it another minute or two to refresh your screen.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, it's not loading. Let me just refresh it. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Now, you've got my test email. Yeah, you can open this up and let me show you this activity panel is where you actually work on these emails. Like you've got assignment two. This is the ownership. The very first thing that you notice is the ownership. So you go ahead, click on this assigned to, and then you won't probably find anybody here because we have not added. But if you assign this ticket to yourself for now, you would notice unassigned will drop down and this email will start to splash inside the mind section for you. Okay. This is exactly what is going to happen for all the representatives in your team, so that when they assign emails to themselves, it becomes a part of mine. Yeah. Now, before we move ahead, so, could you help me understand what different category of emails do you receive today? Like do you want to first of all, go ahead and put them, put those into tags? Yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Maybe I'm just thinking, is it better to do this exercise with the team? Because they have a better understanding?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. We can. So, let me see what administrative setup we can do today. Now, apart from this, do you have an SLA? Like, what is the timeframe in which you want to answer the question for the very first email?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Within four hours on a business day?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let's go ahead and first of all, get into the admin panel, please. All right. Shared inboxes?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Sorry, my fingers in the way.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, this is the shared inbox. Let's go to, hello inquiries. And first of all, let's go ahead and look at the SLA policy. Second last policy, create an SLA policy, give it a name. It's a general or default, whatever you want to call it. The four hours one. So it could be a policy.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Let's call it for us.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And now this email, the SLA, four hours work on all the emails.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So what we can do is, so we will consider the business hours also let's first of all, go ahead and say in four hours, we want to respond to these emails. So here, you need to put in the four hours and this is resolution. Now, I'll tell you the difference. Now, when I send you an email, you need to respond to me in no more than four hours is the first response time, but not that we are into a business, which is more like, hey, where is my order? Hey, there you go. It's not a typical E commerce, right? So I'm not closing conversation on every email. It could be a back and forth now, if it requires multiple follow ups or back and forth from customers, resolution is when your ticket is actually marked closed. Now, do you want to say it should be no more than 48 hours or 24 hours? That would be a difference between the first response and resolution? Yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  What should be the resolution timing here?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  So, if you put in 48 hours and it considers only business hours?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We can choose to do that. Yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  But what does that mean? Does it mean? Like it's 48 divided by eight or 48 hours? Yes?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Exactly. If we, if we put in the business hours, that, that's going to be my next step. If we, if we put in the business hours, we'll set this up right after, this immediately would consider if you are working nine to five. So business hours are essentially nine to five. So anything which is beyond five is not going to be triggered or considered in the reporting for you?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Yeah. And like these hours, how are they considered? Like if I put in eight, if I put in 10 hours in here?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That would be like if an email has come at three P. M and, you know, that you're working only until five. So two hours today and the remainder starting from nine tomorrow. Okay?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Got it. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So that would be safe to say it's instead 24, we could say 24 hours.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, I'm just thinking because I think we would do only business hours and then like if we say two days with only business hours, I would put in 16 hours.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  16 hours. Yeah, fair enough to look at it. Yeah, put in the 16 hours. Yeah. And who would need to be notified, Tom, yourself? You would get an option to select yourself here from the dropdown?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  I am.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. On the top also. So you'll be always notified as in when we breach this.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Apply.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Something's in the way I always have this thing. The zoom thing is always where it doesn't it shouldn't.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  be no worries. Yeah, we can do Google meets next time, sir. You could create the policy.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Should I put business hours?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We will do that. Yeah, we will do that. For that. We need to first of all, create it. Let's just create the SLA policy. And what you can do is for now, you can just disable it. Okay. Now, let's go to the settings at the bottom. Okay? Create a new business policy template here. Create business hour template. You can call it general business hours or Australia business, however you call it.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  General is fine. Yeah. Okay. Now, here, if you scroll this a little down, you get an option to drag and drop. Okay, choose the actual working hours from here now.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Okay. Cool. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, you could cross this one and drag this one towards bottom.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Great. Now, scroll this a little down so you can just delete this one too. Yeah, scroll this. Now. We can always come back later and set the holidays as in when the entire team is here, it will be easier for us to recall all the calendar holidays or national holidays.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. I know them, but I can just copy them from our ivr, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Very easy.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  To do that. Yeah, sure. Save. And now, I want you to take me again into the feature access. Okay? I want to make sure you have turned on out of office for team's availability and business hour template please? Okay. So this is not applied on anywhere. Okay? Let's go back into the shared mailboxes. Now, inquiries inbox… SLA, before we go into SLA. Can you take me to the settings? Please? Okay. Apply this here. Choose the one that we just created and save it.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, do you want to notify your teammates when a new conversation arrives, whenever there's a new ticket? Do you want to just notify your customer representatives? Yeah, fair enough. All right now. Okay. Let's go to the slas. Again… click on the edit option here. This is a pencil button. Okay. Now you should get an option to select the considered business hours. Yeah. Okay. Now there's a little quick catch here. Now, this is when you miss the first response when nobody has worked on a ticket in four hours, you get notified, there's a trigger running on the emails and this is resolution like for about 16 business hours. Now. Think of it in a way that this is the timing for me to reach at the platform to catch a train. But before that, I want to get a notification, a trigger, a due soon alarm, which is more like in about two hours when I set it, I would say in another two hours, you need to reach the station, which is just definitely very helpful for these users to forget everything and work on absolutely needed thing. Like I need to close this one before I get into more tickets. Yeah. Do you want to set up that SLA stat like a due SLA notification? Or do you want to be like, okay with it or? Yeah. So this will be overdue. This is like already missed. You can't do anything. This is before you miss it, you get a notification that these are the ones which are absolutely important for now.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So basically, yeah. So basically, this is three hours. Yeah. So you're just giving one hour buffer window, most of my customers try and do 50 percent of it, which will still give them sufficient amount of time. But yeah, you could use to say that.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then 18 hours here. Sorry, eight hours here so that they still know that in another eight hours, they need to somehow close the ticket, whatever follow up is needed or whatever. And then again, we could notify everybody here also that, hey, the ticket is now about to breach the con. Yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  I'll just do this for now. I'll probably change this later.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can, yeah, we can probably have multiple administrators in your account so that even any support user or a customer support agent which is a senior one can actually go ahead and tweak all of these. Yeah, cool. All right now, how about the customer satisfaction? Let's just quickly go ahead and understand when you reply to an email, there'll be a quick snippet at the bottom asking for whether or not we are happy with the level of support you're doing. Do you want to do that or later?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  I don't think we want that right now. No, the mood thingy, the like Smiley face that's.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  right.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  That's like doesn't have anything to do with this.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood very clear. All right now, apart from that, let's go to the auto assignment. Now, this is what we call it round Robin. Now. If you deal with heavy volume of emails on everyday basis and your five user team and, hello inquiries inbox is pretty much trained equally like everybody is able to take care of all the emails now instead of Tom or a team leader manually triaging emails or assigning them. Hiver will allocate these emails to all the agents online by default.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, we can always turn this on. Okay? And we could, yeah, you could make sure that which users should not receive emails from your team. So you could just say, no, Tom doesn't need to work on emails every day. Yeah, you could always exclude yourself and the remainder four people will get emails in the round Robin fashion. And hiver will make sure that these emails are assigned on team distribution level. Yeah. Okay.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  A way to set more automations.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. This is round Robin by the way. This is different than automations. Now. If you say workflow automations, where you are choosing the skill based assignment. For an example, Rakesh only deals with bookings for xyz location. Yeah, or Tom deals with the cancellation, that will still take precedence, but the remainder of the tickets are not going to be in the unassigned. It would still be allocated to the people online.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Got it. So it's more like the automation would run first. And then if there's.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  and then, yes, that.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Is correct, it would just go into the round Robin.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. That's correct. All right. So we can save this and let's go to the automations here.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  I don't think it worked.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Would you click on, allow users to control their availability so that they can? Yeah. Okay.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  I just failed to save.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, this is weird… all inbound.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Maybe it's because I'm the only one and I'm excluded.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it could be. Yeah, it is definitely. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Let's go to the automation workflows. So this is where you have the skill based assignments, create an automation. Okay? Give it a name. Like what is it that you first want to solve? Like what's the use case here?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  For example, virtual office. Okay. Just assignment based on, I don't know text actually assignment just always goes to one user that's the idea.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So add a stamp… if condition now select the condition. Is this a specific subject or the body of the email that talks about virtual office?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, let's say subject first of all, let's tick both the boxes. Subject is any of instead of is, can you drop down and say contains any of now, think about different variables that could talk about this virtual office that you've been receiving emails about, yeah, type in the same?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  okay. That's all I can think about.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Or condition… drop down. Now, let's also consider the body of the email because then it's going to be doing a wider search for you virtual on demand. Do they also say virtual office?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. But would it just?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Virtual will be captured, but virtual office if they have, if somebody happens to put it in as like a common word. So, I would say let's be more, you know? Yeah, here, also if you could do virtual office that'll help us narrow down the search. Okay? Now add a step… assign action. Now, what we essentially want to do is assign to, yes, select condition, action, assign to, yes. Please. Now, you said there's only one person that these emails get assigned to for now, we don't have that person, we can always come back and edit it for now. You can just always say assign it to Tom and add a step as, and when we create new tags. Now, this is where I would, I was referring to virtual office, could be one of the tags to classify emails into multiple buckets. Otherwise, what I could have also done is add action and always tag that email that's a virtual office email. So that at any point in time you want to search for, how many virtual office emails are there, you could just run a quick search on the tag.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Yeah. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Here, we, I don't think we have got a tag option, but you can always add a tag once we add the tags by default. So you'll be able to add tags here as well. Okay. For now, let's just save and let's not enable it by the time before we find, make sure that we are done with all the final setup. We'll just keep it as it is for now. Yeah, can you think of any more automation workflows? But by now, I think you, you've got an idea that you need to do that inside the shared inboxes for automations, but let me help you. I can help you with any more automations for now?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  No, I think like most of them would be with have to do with Salesforce. Maybe if you could set up Salesforce next, that might be short.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. For that.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  I don't know what your plan is, but sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, for that, I think we need to first enable the integration for that. Can you click me? Yeah, take me to the integrations part. Okay. Do you see the Salesforce integration here? Yes, please start setup.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, select the mailbox inquiries, everyone in the inbox.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  All right. That was easy.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it is indeed. Okay. All right. Now, with regards to the Salesforce, let's also go to the administration first, the shared inboxes here, and take me to the inquiries inbox. Please. All… right, automations, workflow, create… an automation. Let's call it Salesforce.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, whenever there's a new conversation coming into hiver, add a step condition. If now at the bottom, do you see the Salesforce? Yeah, please. Now, what is the variable through which you want to create the automation workflow cases? Email connect? Yeah, contact owner.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Maybe contact. Yeah, that's… a good one. Let's say.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Email is a good variable or the owner. I mean, what exactly do you want to say as long as somebody is owning a case in Salesforce, you want to assign the same email in hiver with that representative?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then the owner is the appropriate option?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Contact?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Owner is from email address or two, I think.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  What's the difference, from?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is, is going to be the customer, or a client or? Yeah, somebody's sending us an email, yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. I want that. I guess I want that and then assigned to that owner. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, do you have those predefined people who contact you that goes to a specific representative? Like, is that a predefined… rule that you already have in Salesforce today?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, we do. Well, no, actually, we don't have, we have Salesforce email integration. So maybe actually it's more leads. So maybe if the lead email actually… contact owner, yeah, probably contact owner. I'm just thinking like if somebody emails us and the owner is someone in the inquiries team, then it should go to that person.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes. Now, it works the other way. Actually, now, if that owner is present in Salesforce, because by default Salesforce picks up that ownership. Yeah. And in hiver, you want to assign the same owner so that there are no two different people working on a common place, correct? Okay. Yeah. Then in that case instead of two email addresses, a better variable two. Okay. And this is where you would say add a step and… assign action. Now, you need to get an option, yeah, assign two and then you simply go ahead and, you know, Salesforce contact owner. Yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Great. Okay. Easy.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And that's how we can even look into different cases, different sort of, you know, assignments. Yeah, all of that is possible. Okay, cool. For now, what we can do is by the time, we enable the entire team user, we can turn this off. But once we have everybody logging into hiver, make sure everybody is onboarded. We can always come back and turn all the automations. Yeah. Okay. Something very important, custom fields which will help you classify your, and organize your data much better. Now, for an example, can you click on add field for me? I mean, if that doesn't make sense, we'll just come back. Now, do you receive emails into your, hello inbox from different sources and you want to just simply use a drop down and say this comes from location a BCDE. And this could be a booking request. It could be something to do with which vendor or supplier is contacting us, supplier, a BCDE. Now, do you think of that use case where we could use a drop down option. Now, remember where you have open pending, closed tickets. Now, you had ownership assigned to, but right below it, you would also have an option to use this custom field. Okay?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. There would be heaps, I reckon like our locations would be one, for example, yeah, the location names. Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. So you could say location?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Street, or, okay. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I mean, whatever is better, actually by the way, many times of the verbiage, I'm assuming you would know much better than me. Yeah. And this is where the values are.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. And then here I can do like colon street is called colons.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  I'm just having a couple.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you have any in post by any chance?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  No.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Yeah, we could save this field and I'll show you what it looks like. Let's just click close on the admin panel and go back to the Gmail inbox. Okay. Let's go to unassigned or just look at this one. Now, if you notice mine, yeah, go to mine and this test email. Now, do you notice this drop down here, the location?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, that's really good now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You can actually search for these location emails. You could create views and run reports on these. And if there's anything which is used for due date, which could be when you want to follow up with the client or things like it, you could use this variable as a calendar for yourself.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Cool. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, these are the tags I was referring to. Whenever you receive an email, you could always categorize those like virtual office was one use case. You told me second could be bookings, cancellations, high priority escalation, you could always categorize those emails.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm sorry, I lost you for a second.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, that is okay. You're back all.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. All right. Yeah. So, do you want to go to tags option and let's just, I'll just show you how simple it is to create tags. You don't have to do anything with these top labels. So let it be like that. Only this is you could manage the tags if you click on tags… and just click on plus one. Yeah… and think of let's say virtual office. All right now. Put in some description here for my hiver, AI to look at these tags and automatically start tagging these emails on your behalf.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. As.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  In, when a custom, as in, when somebody sends an email with virtual office or, yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Give this.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  A user. Yeah, someone?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Mentions virtual office?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Comma, I think, we did put a couple of more words, right? On… demand, yeah, I.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  guess that's it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And essentially, these are the requests regarding, what are these requests actually? Is this of a virtual office booking? No?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  It's more like a type of membership that we have.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. So, you could just signify that it'll be like even better search for hiver AI and then tagging those for you?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. Yeah, let's create, you could choose to give it a color.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Sorry?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's okay. That's fine. You can always edit it from here. There's a three dots here right next to the virtual office tag.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, coding color coding would actually give you a little bit of more clarity and, you know, that's all. Yeah. Now you could always come back and create more tags and it's just not the administrators, even the teams can also do that. Okay. Apart from that.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  How does the description? So, I will suggest to use certain tags on certain emails based on the description that I put in. Yeah. Okay. Got it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, apart from that, could you again take me to the… admin console… shared inboxes? Let's go ahead. Yeah, go into the mailbox, let's go ahead and add users. Let's add your team, but do you want to drop them an email note or a slack or whatever internal communication you use that we are going to add you in hiver? Then they don't have to do anything once we connect with the team. I myself will personally help them on board.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. They simply need to download a hiver extension and be a part of hiver. But essentially, if you ask me, I don't want them to feel overwhelmed or maybe confused because if I could take them through step by step onboarding and guidance, they'll be easier for them to adapt to it. Of course, not to look at 100 things which are not needed for now.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Let's do this later then.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So we'll invite them later, right? So once we add them to the meeting and then immediately on prompt, we'll just have everybody log it into hiver and play around with the system while I onboard. Okay. Apart from that, we have looked at the autoresponders. We looked into the integrations, custom fields of their auto assignment. We looked at slas, the autoresponder. Yeah. So these are the emails which we received today in your hello inbox, but you want to respond them, like want to respond them, with a specific template like, hey, our working hours are xyz in the meanwhile, if you are trying to help yourself, look at our faq section. So this is more like an autoresponder to those emails and you can set autoresponders according to the business hours as well.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Yeah. All right. That might be pretty useful. Are there a?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Template already available for you?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  No, we don't do autoresponding at the moment. Okay, cool. I'll look into this. What's the AI options? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Please click here. Now, this is AI agents where you'll be able to automatically tag the emails. Like I just did a click, quick example. This is a sentiment analysis as and when you receive emails, however go through summarizes gets you a context, whether or not it's a happy customer or sad customer, something which is concerning, you will be able to see the red face on top of the email.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then thank you detector. You can always turn this on. This is more like once we are done with the conversation and you don't have to do anything. It's like a thank you note from the customer hiver automatically understands detects that email and closes it for you so that, your team is absolutely working on the ones which are needed for you. Excellent. Okay. Then is a co pilot?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Sorry, I had to change rooms. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, this is where hiver helps you compose the email, summarize the email. Now, this is a session. I would want to spend maybe 15, 20 extra minutes with you so that, I could literally help you understand the AI functionalities on the emails just as a quick, you know, glance, if you could take me to the email, maybe my test email for please. Yeah. Now, when you are opening the email, do you see the very first thing here on the top which is a magic wand? So this basically is actually summarizing the conversation. Now, this looks like a simple email, right? I sent you for a testing, but imagine if there's an email which has a back and forth and your customer is asking for something, either your agent has to go through the entire email and understand the context or you can click here and it will decode the conversation for you. Now, if you take me to the, yeah, if you click this, it will just take a minute or less and help you understand what is the exact context of the email.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Otherwise, if you need to assign this email to somebody, you can always save this as a note and add mention your colleague then.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. All… right. Now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  If you are replying to this email, can you click on reply button? You always get an option to reply using your email address? Or if you have added this as an alias in Google now, do you get an option to click here by the way somewhere on my name here? Okay. Now, do you see that you're going to respond using your email address? But you always have an option to reply from your support. Let me just see. Do you see an option that gives you? Okay. So both of the both, are these your email addresses? Okay. I don't think now, can I understand, would your team reply using their personal emails or the, hello at the rate inbox?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Hello, at most of the time, they would reply with the same inbox that the email came in?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. Let's just go ahead and set it up as well apart from that before we do that, do you see this option that says the compose here? This is again an AI functionality where hiver can help you compose the email?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Whatever you write, it could just help you fix the grammar, expand it and all of that. And as, and when we declare the source for the knowledge base, if you click on this star button, the copilot, this is where you can ask hiver to draft a reply or summarize the conversation. And in order to draft a reply, it would look at a source information and this source information could be your faqs. Could be a different website help pages that we can always put that in the administrative control panel and you can control it.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Got it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, let's go ahead and set up the send as email. Can you take me to the Gmail settings, please see all settings… accounts. The fourth tab. Now, there must be the email which is hello at the rate, which is not an alias. Can you make it by default? Okay. Wait a second. Can you reply from the email address the email was originally sent to? Can you toggle this one on please?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And scroll it towards the bottom and save it. Maybe if we could get an option to save it. Oh, this has been saved already. Let's go back to Gmail. Main inbox. I would ask you to hard refresh your email just once. If you're using MacBook, it will be command up shift and R.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, I just did.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Inquiries. Let's go to mine. Rakesh's email reply. And now you get an option to reply by default from, hello. Now, the idea is as long as emails are sent to, hello, you get an email response from hello by default, but you can still choose to reply from your email address, should you need to, from a drop down? Yeah. If the emails are sent to you personally, Tom, you would by default reply from Tom. Yeah. How do you change?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  This name? Because I see that it just says my name, not like the comments.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Now, for that from, can you drop your click on the drop down please? Yeah. Okay. Let's take, yeah, let me take you to the Gmail settings. One more time? I think there is an option right there. See all settings… accounts? Okay?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  And maybe it's edit?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Edit info, huh.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I guess you could just add comments here. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, note this is a Gmail setting for every individual. So there's something that we need to take the entire team through?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. No, that's fine. Okay. At least it's an option. Yeah, that's good. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, this is where you add mention people when you want to talk to somebody in your team as in when we add users in the activity, you see, add a note.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So this is where you could add mention your teammates, how many times this customer sent you an email, you could go to the contact button here, the contact page… and it would note, it would tell you how many times I contacted you in the past, yeah, you have the entire conversation, which is a historic information here. All right now, when you're replying to a customer, you always have an option to draft these emails. So these are the templates by the way. For all the repetitive nature of queries, we can always create templates.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Your team must be using some sort of the database to kind of use templates. So you can always let's say, create one for a reference?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let's just say this is a test reference template is test subject is by default, the one that customers are using now content could be, hello customer. Yeah, let's say, hello, and instead of customer name, I would say use this call, please pay P for placeholder. And here, you could say, first name. Okay? And whatever, you know, thank you for contacting us because you're just using it as a test and team will be able to edit this and maybe get actual templates… added here. Soon. Fair enough. Let's just save this. I wanted to first of all, quickly have a look at how it looks like. And then we can always come back and curate more templates. Go back to the mind section, please?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. Go back to mind section… and reply to this email. Use a template from the bottom. This is the template option and let's use this one. Yeah, just put it in root cache and that's how, you know, the fields would populate for you to make sure that you're typing in the names, right? The follow up dates, right? It could be anything, right? It could be like location, whatever variable you want to actually manually put in right there.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Yeah, it doesn't take it from the email.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It does by the way, it was just a quick example of name, but you could think of other things as well. Right? Name can be picked up.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. How do you make it pick up the name? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Let's go to the email templates here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And do you get an option to edit the template? Yeah, test template. Can you click here?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Oh, sorry.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Edit. All right. Hi, first name, and then, do?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  What is the source? Could you take me to the source please? Okay. No, not really. It's okay, select one more time.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's okay. Unselected. Please, let's go ahead and cancel this and create a new template.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you mind if you give me another minute or two? Let me just quickly go ahead and check, give me one second, please. I mean, essentially two minutes, please. All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. For the name. Okay? Now, I'll show this help article with you.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We have got certain predefined rules. So there's a chat up here. Okay? Now, for the full name, we are going to be using a variable like this. And then for the first name, we're going to be using, this is going to be the last name and the user email. So, this help article that I've shared with you, does talk about all of that actually.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Oh, great. So, it would be like help.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Comma.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You don't have to click on placeholder we are by default just using it.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Sorry?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Can you remove this one? Can you just remove this and simply paste it? Yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Save.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  this.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  yeah, cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Reply. Yeah, it's okay. I mean, because there was a draft here, which is why it is.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, insert. Now, by default, it is picking up, right? I mean, if you notice, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Got it. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, the reason, it is showing here and directly not taking you to the template is because sometimes the names are misspelled… or whatever. But while we are actually using the automation, it is always recommended that you proofread it before you hit send button?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  That makes sense. Cool. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. Apart from that, do you see the option here from your hiver itself? If you click on the hiver settings, and then you see the help sent down. This is where you could find any answer to any of your questions, be it, how to set up automations, how to add users, whatever, right? You could search for it, Salesforce automations. Now, this is going to be more like a self help care for you. But given that I'm still a point of contact, we'll be taking care of the quick team training and onboarding. Okay? Now, do you want to check your calendar and let me know if your team is available tomorrow at the same time? If that's okay?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you want to do it slightly end of the day?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, the later the better. So if we could do it like at four P. M our time?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm going to be checking that for you please.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  And should I get the entire team on, or should I just get the two people who will basically be in charge?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  If you take two people who are in charge, it will definitely be easier for us to set up quickly because we'll be having less people and less queries, so we can focus on the basic setup because we haven't been able to set up clearly like the different automations, different templates and everything. Now, once we're completely set up, yeah, once we are completely set up, these two people are added, so you three will be able to share the emails and everything. Remainder two people can either be managed by these two folks or if we require, we can even connect on Friday and take care of the complete team training in one go. Okay. Yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Let's do that. Then I'll get the two people in charge in tomorrow.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. For, I do have another call at four, but can I do four 30 if that's okay. Yeah.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, four 30 is fine.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I'll make it for 45 minutes and I'll call it hybrid onboarding again.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I have your email address, Tom. So I'm going to be adding you and give you the access to edit the invite and add two more folks from your team. Okay, great. Okay. Are they more comfortable with zoom or Google hangouts?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  No, zoom is fine.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Sent you an invite for tomorrow.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Thanks.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Great. I'll just try and play around a little bit.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Definitely. Now, the best thing is while you have already set up hiver, you still have the existing way of working the way your team is working. You don't have to get confused in case they have already just simply close these in hiver. The idea is from the day we set up for the complete onboarding and kickoff with the entire team that's when we would stop working from our, I mean, from our traditional way, like we don't have to then log in into hello at the rate inbox. But for now, since everybody is not onboarded, I would say let the team work the way they are doing, so that we are not interrupting them.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Anything else that I can be of help to you today?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  No, this is a good start.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It has by default starting the frt for you. And you see these little sentiment smileys, right? How many of them? So, Emma board looks like a little pirate or angry customer. So we can probably look at why?

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, issues with the member portal. So, yeah, this is how the AI tagging would actually help you look at those emails which are important, absolutely, pick those one up and start working on it immediately. And yeah, we'll go over more of such use cases.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Cool. And with assigning the tags, that's always a manual thing like they will never be done by the AI, no.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We can automate that totally depends upon what tags are these, what conditions are these? If somebody is asking for member portal, somebody is asking for technical request, we can always go ahead and create workflows. So you don't have to do manually at all.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay. Yeah. Got it. Cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely, Tom. Thank you so much for again joining me today. Let's reconnect again, tomorrow, complete the setup and then take care of the team training as well. Yeah. Should there be any more questions? Like I always say, I'm just an email away from you. Feel free to write back and I'll be right there.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Okay, awesome. Thank you so much. Thanks Rakesh, you're very.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Welcome. All right. Thank you. Goodbye.

Tom Van Ommeren (t.vanommeren@thecommons.com.au):
  Bye.
