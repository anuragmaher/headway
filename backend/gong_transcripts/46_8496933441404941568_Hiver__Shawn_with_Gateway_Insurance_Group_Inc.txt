Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Sean. Can you hear me?

SW:
  Yes, yes. Can you hear me?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Loud and clear, Sean, how's it going today?

SW:
  Good. How about yourself? Doing good?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thanks for checking in. Sean. I'm guessing it's just the two of us unless you're expecting somebody from your side.

SW:
  No, just us all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Brilliant. So, yeah, Sean to kick us off. I'm Raghav, I'm going to be working with you and helping you uncover more of helpscout the AI features on hiver, notice that you've selected all the three features that we had, so to kick us off, could you just give me a quick summary in terms of how you're using hiver as of today?

SW:
  Yeah, we're basically a property and casualty insurance company over here in the states but we use it well, I don't know what the right definition is, but we kind of use it as a ticketing system so that when we get emails in, I have staff… in New Mexico and California, not huge amounts of staff obviously, as you can see on our hiver usage, but it just enables us to, you know, share the emails, look at them at the same time, talk about them because usually we're connected via well, not necessarily a zoom meeting, but we use meets to connect during the day. Oh, and then I have a philippine virtual assistant also that, you know, she's on there as well, but it just enables us to connect them. We're not using the full benefits of it because I haven't had time to really dig into it and put it together like I'd like it to work with that. Said, we're also a franchise and we are merging with brightway insurance and they use a totally different, not… hiver system but they use a different management system that we'll have to convert to. And, you know, I just don't know how much or what parts of it we're going to continue to use after that, we'll continue to use it. I just don't know if all the features I want to implement will be on hiver side or they'll be on brightway side basically. But, you know, it's more or less just a way for us to track the emails, keep up with them, see what everybody else is working on et cetera. Et cetera. They don't get auto assigned when they come in there's you know, a lot of stuff that comes in here that I have to delete which I'd love to write code for to get rid of as far as the AI goes, I'm just, you know, I'm in the same position. Everybody else is. We're checking out everything, looking at everything and seeing, you know, which options are going to be the best fit for our industry, I guess.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. No, that makes total sense. Thanks for the quick little summary. Now, you know, when it comes to the AI functionality and just the general way in which you're using hiver. I do have one more follow up question before I jump into maybe talking a little bit more in detail about the AI feature set as a whole. Now, you know, you're on the pro plan which means you do have access to like advanced automations and like specific triggers and things like that. What does your workflows on hiver look like… in the sense of do you have any that like add a tag or assign it to somebody?

SW:
  No, that's the part that, you know, just because each one of our service reps, we pretty much handle everything. I don't have specific funnels or lanes that any one person would handle. And we're not real huge. Either. There's really only four of us that handle the entire company when it comes to service work. But that's the areas I'd look into. The main feature we use is we assign it to an individual after they take responsibility of it and they work it. And then we would use the, we use the pending feature quite a bit where, you know, we can move it out of the box and it comes back up in a few days if we don't get a response. But as far as the, you know, the tagging, the auto tagging, the auto assigning, you know, reading the emails or getting rid of the email. If it doesn't pertain, I manually do a lot of that. And that's the part that I didn't know if AI plays a part in that. I'm sure it does to some degree, it's just a matter of setting those, you know, those triggers up to move it, you know, delete it to do whatever we have to do with the email because, yeah, it's a, we don't use it to its full potential. Let's put it that way. It has way more power than I'm using it for.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I.

SW:
  don't have the time to set it all up and, or, you know, some of the features. I don't understand. I have to go in and read about them to make sure they'll do what I want before I do them. You know, I'd love for the stuff that, you know, sits for a few days without having to pend it, you know, when it sits for a few days and it gets driven down towards the bottom of the main general box that we use, I guess, you know, for it to pop back up with some urgency… and it doesn't you know what I mean? It doesn't have like a different and I probably don't have it set up, right? Are you familiar with? And I know you are, you know, how like when you're working on a, I have some other businesses that I use and we work with like the cards on the screen. I would love for these emails to turn into a card, you know, with a certain color or something behind them so that, you know, what stage or what process they're in. And that might even be a feature of hiver and we might even be getting off the AI stuff. So, if I'm not talking AI and it's not your Lane, you know, just a meeting, but I mean.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

SW:
  I don't know how much of a hiver you can see on your side that we use it for, but yeah, we're not using the full potential of it. I'd love to use a lot more of that automation stuff that you're talking about. I read about it. I look at it and then I just, you know, fail at setting it up to be honest.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's completely fine. Sean. I mean, there's you know, like two ways through which you can make hiver more powerful. Like given the last eight years I've been at the company and all the different people that I've spoken to for hiver, you know, right now, hiver's at a place where AI or not you're going to be able to like do a whole lot more in terms of just making things simpler on an operational level, right? And then you add on top of it, it's going to make life a whole lot more simpler, especially starting with like the categorization as such, you know, just with like emails coming in and how should it be categorized, right? So, I think, excuse me maybe just start with the foundations there again because right now, if everybody's going to be reading emails or if there's like specific people in the team that reads the email and then sends it to the right person, I'm guessing a lot of that decision on who gets it or, you know, what it's about, even is going to rely on the context of the conversation, right? Maybe something they say, but more white brush, broad stroke on that front that's where AI tagging would probably be my first recommendation for you, right? And Sean, if you can share your screen, I can probably help you get some of these things set up right now.

SW:
  Yeah, I can share it. Let's see here. I don't use zoom. I want to share screen right there. Hang on. I got… a few monitors here. Let me figure out which one this is on.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure thing.

SW:
  I don't… want to share just the tab. I want to share the whole screen, I think.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, just the tab's. Fine.

SW:
  Are you sure?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We go to switch to admin panel. Yeah, just the tab's fine. Everything loads on the same tab on hiver.

SW:
  Well, let's see if that does it, you see this screen here?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just a second. Yes, I can see your screen. Yep. Perfect.

SW:
  These colors are something that I use for who the email is coming in from. It has nothing to do with hiver. Obviously, of course, I probably need to get rid of it because it's probably not up to date but over here obviously are our different boxes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

SW:
  So, this is a company, this is another company that's in the insurance business and we service her accounts, but that's going to be going away. This columbine one, we'll be going away because she's joining the brightway team. Brightway is also going to take over a lot of our service work when I don't know how much, you know, about insurance but, you know, like when a client calls in to switch out an automobile or, you know, get id cards or things like that that's going to go away from us. Yes. Yeah. And we're going to be way more focused on, you know, selling and marketing and which is what we really want to do anyway. So that's I mean, yeah, because we get bogged down with servicing the clients, but this is the main box that we use. Pretty much everything goes through here. This one and then commercial, I had commercial separated but we kind of put it all together now in the year because there's only four of us. And then gateway, the quotes are leads that our marketing team which is going to expand. Right now. There's only two people that market the quotes come into here or the information does. And then this box is for my philippine… va and the marketing team kind of to work together with. And then the individuals can also reps can also get in there and see what's going on with each and every account. So we don't have a huge amount of unassigned. Our team consists of… Alexis who does no service work. She's kind of a staff person that used to work with me. She works on my financial. We also own a financial side of the business also where we have a bunch of reps over there, but she works with them. Now, Chelsea works out of my California office. Denise is my philippine va. Katie sits in my New Mexico office, and then I sit here and then we have a reception. We have a reception that just puts stuff in there and then it immediately, you know, we take it and run with it when she puts it in there. So there's never anything assigned to her. So that's that?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, I mean that.

SW:
  Go.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Ahead. I do have like a couple of questions over here, Sean, go ahead. What is the o one, a carrier emails and o one gateway gig, are those like stuff that you manually add after the fact?

SW:
  What do?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  They mean?

SW:
  Where at, show me?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  The one on your screen, these two ones, the gateway gig, o one and red or brown, I want to say. And then the one.

SW:
  Those would be, when I go into one, those would be my tags probably from up here that I got set up inside. They're my labels on my side. They don't mean anything to hiver per SE. I don't even know if they can. I guess they can be seen by you because you're on my screen, exactly. Those tags can't be seen that's just because I own several different businesses and I do work on both the financial side, my brother and I own the company. So I work on the financial side and the property and casualty. So I will, I bounce back and forth from stuff, but, that means nothing.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Now. The reason why I asked is if those were essentially categories that you'd want the team to see as a whole, that's the angle that I was coming in from?

SW:
  Well, and that would work through these tags, right? This is a hiver tag. These are hiver tags that's exactly where we would set this up, correct? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You're done it the right way. Now, what I'd want to do is.

SW:
  We, we just utilize a lot of the incoming tools. So everything comes in here like, you know, some of these should be pending in a sense. Okay? They're in here. And the issue is that my staff, when they come in, everybody sees the American modern one opens it and then nobody does anything with it until I do, because that's a carrier. You know, this here would be actually a carrier that's you know, sending out some information for a meeting similar to what we're on probably. And it has no bearing as far as a client servicing aspect. So my staff really doesn't even need to see this if they do, you know, they either, what they do is they would move it… over here. I kind of set up some of these priority objects. They would just move it to carrier marketing so that they would be able to close it at that point on their side, it would go away but it would still be on my side obviously because it sticks in there until I move it. But, you know, that's what they do with it. But I'd love for these to come into a separate mailbox and that's probably, you know, I don't know if it's setting up another, you know, I just need another place for these to go so that I can review them and then delete them at the end of the day. So if AI can figure out that it's a marketing email versus a service email and separate them, that's the first thing I would use it for.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, definitely. I mean, what we can do is instead of like, you know, three things I've identified so far, but so, thanks for the details. Can you click on your hiver logo and I'll just run you through some recommendations I think would help.

SW:
  Is that in one or?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. The setting one, yeah, admin panel from there, please?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So, can you open up the one where you just showed me that marketing email?

SW:
  The email itself or?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no. The inbox, so, can you click on shared inboxes on the left side?

SW:
  Oh, on the gateway? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. And then, yeah, can you go to automations?

SW:
  Oh, automations, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just straight up. So there's two ways in which we can do it, right? The one route that I was thinking about first is the automations. So what I effectively want to do is have the same stuff followed which is have the priority updated. We'll base it off of the from email address and the word which is American. I'm sorry, I forgot the word American monitor. Yeah. So, yeah. So we'll basically say any email that's got the word American more have that tagged as marketing or updated as marketing and move it to closed automatically. Then what we can do is you don't even need to like forward it outside. Don't go through the hassle of creating a whole new inbox. And all of that, what you can effectively do is I'll help you create a view based on that dropdown option. So that way you don't need to shift through the whole lot and unassigned mine and team can basically have a smaller view that just says, hey, just marketing emails from this person or this company. You can go there, review it. If you want to delete it. You delete it. If you want to move it to open or action on it, you can do that.

SW:
  And I might have it set up, right? With chubb, which is another carrier. Chubb is another insurance carrier similar to American modern. So I set this up.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So at this point, what you've done is you've basically said if the from email contains chubb North America, move it to closed, only extra step here that I'd suggest is adding that drop down items or like the drop down objects as an option to be filled out.

SW:
  Right. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And then on the other side, like if you click on the three dots, I can give you like a couple examples of how we can.

SW:
  On this one, this particular one?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that one and then edit. Okay… I will just, yeah. So there we go. So right now, what you've said is from email contains any of chubb North America as a phrase. Can you click on the, or button this one here? Yeah. And then what we do is select the drop down again and then do from email… can you click on the drop down here and say, is any of or… contains any of, yeah, the same one basically, right? And if you have the email address, because most of these marketing emails always come in from something like no reply at notifications at newsletter at, you know?

SW:
  You guys work on the shoot, the… other email side too? Outlook, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, we do. We've got a separate web application that supports outlook.

SW:
  Well, and that's what brightway… is going to be that's their backbone. They use the outlook as their backbone. So, I don't know we might be merging over to that. I haven't decided how we're going to do it until onboarding happens. So, these mostly come from the other thing. So when they come in, they go, well, they go to our general mailbox. This one's actually, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Common grow mailing list from the looks of it.

SW:
  Yeah. And you can't you have to, I don't want to say it's a drill down on it. There's a way to see everything in there. I think you click one of these, takes… it out and you can see the original email somewhere. I just forget where it is.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, that's fine. That doesn't make a difference for us.

SW:
  Do you know how to get to it from this? Or it doesn't make any difference? Okay?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It doesn't make a difference at this point because what we really need is we're going to be giving it two conditions that act together, right? So we'll say that, click on the dropdown again and just copy that gateway. Igi, the one, right?

SW:
  Right here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, back to the email, please. Yeah, this one, the dropdown, the small one. Yeah. What we need is the full bold text at the top and the email address right below it. Yeah, that whole thing.

SW:
  We need, okay, yeah, along with it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Along with gateway, igi. Oh, no. The actual email address, gateway service at gateway igi.

SW:
  Well, that's actually ours though.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

SW:
  Do you want me to copy that as well?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, please. All right. Now, let's go back to the one that had chubb, we'll just rename it. But basically, we can have all of this stacked into the same room. You don't even need like three four rules for this, right? So now that we're here, it said from email contains any of hit, enter and put that gateway igi?

SW:
  Oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  yeah. So over here, we've got chubb North America. Let's put that in. Let's replace chubb North America with American modern insurance?

SW:
  Just that just that or the one I copied?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  The one you copied the text you copied?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  There we go. Perfect. All right. Can you scroll down just a bit more, click on the end at the top. This one this, one, this one? Yeah. All right. And then move.

SW:
  to the drop down?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm still getting used to the annotation. But, yeah, the drop down from email contains any of or rather from email is, and then we'll pump in that gateway service again, just that same email address.

SW:
  Put it in again. Okay. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Put it in again. All right. So that's good. Let's delete this one here, select, get rid of that. So, what we've basically done is we've combined the two together and this rule will only fire when this exactly matches, which is the text in the email should be American modern insurance and the from email has got to be gateway service.

SW:
  Okay. And then it automatically moves to closed. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Automatically moves to closed, scroll down. Add another action that says, add a tag action.

SW:
  Yeah. Oh, action. Okay. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Action there. And then drop down, add a tag there we go. Oh, wait. No. Sorry. You had a custom field dropped on for this, right? So let's do custom field, scroll down and you should see the custom field as well. That priority field. Yeah, that one there. All right. And then drop down. Let's select that marketing option that you had because these are newsletters, right? So we're going for the same one?

SW:
  Yeah, all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Brilliant. Okay. So now save on the top right over here. All right. Brilliant. Okay. Now that it's enabled, let's just rename it. So, you know what the actual thing is?

SW:
  I rename it in inside edit or?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I think you've got to do it inside edit, just change the layout for this. Sorry, my bad. I should have told you that sooner.

SW:
  Up here, right? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  American modern?

SW:
  All right.

SW:
  All right. And then save it when you're.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  ready, let's go. So from now, just monitor the inbox, going forward. Anything from American modern is going to run through this condition set, get mark and get closer.

SW:
  And then I can do the exact same for the cars, another one. Can you have multiple marketing ones inside one condition? I mean, one automation? Or do I have to do one separate? Is it best to do one separate for each carrier that sends over all the marketing, each one does the same thing obviously. But like that job, we'll send over stuff, guard all of them, do?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So they all do it, and this is going to be the same like American modern? Yeah. Yes. Name's going to have the carrier, the email address is yours? Yes. All right. Then you can just stack it up on one rule. You can have up to like five of those coupled into one. So edit again, yeah, I.

SW:
  don't… know. I don't know what the actual.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. I'm just going to show you where it is.

SW:
  Yeah. Go ahead. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So all you need to do is come here, come to this block at the top specifically and just or pump the rest in.

SW:
  Got it. And then I would just match this with whatever's out there on the email.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, don't change the one below the one that says and gateway service gateway. Igi leave that.

SW:
  Static that would stay the same, right? Yeah, exactly.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That would be static. So that's your one true measure. And then the ones at the top gets run through and whichever one matches gets filed under the automation, right?

SW:
  Okay. So I can stack them up there and I can put up to five, you said, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's right.

SW:
  Okay. That's going to be a huge load off of the email box right off the bat. Now, there's another one that, all right? It's already saved. Let me go here. There's. Another one, we have a corporate office that sends over a ton of stuff. Kim wambolt, is one of them. So there's several agencies within that, the network. All right. So, a lot, I mean, like 90 percent of these that come over do not apply to us. They send them out… to all the franchisees across the country. Kim does one of them. And then, Let me see. Well, I don't see her on here today, but there's another actually, let me see if there's any in the inbox. Yeah, I can't think of her name off the top of my head, but those I would love to get out of there as well.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hang on.

SW:
  Here a minute. Her name is Melissa… right here. Like, oh, there's one there from today. So when they go to the franchise distribute, you know, she's not really a marketing thing. I kind of need to look at these but high level, they don't need to be looked at immediately when they come over. Is there a way to like we?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just do the same thing we just did.

SW:
  Yeah, but I got to look at them at some time. So I'd have to remember to go into, is there a way to move them depending versus closed? And then when my staff gets caught up, they can go in there and look at them because we do need to look at them. Sometimes they apply. Sometimes they don't like this could be one of our clients but it typically is not, there's. A 90 percent chance. It is not 10 percent chance that it is.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So we.

SW:
  don't want to miss it if it's ours, but we don't want to look at all of them when they come in.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Now, I hear you completely. So I just saw how you're handling that you're dropping. I mean, the dropdown object there is completed client, something, right? So just repeat the same automation we created for this case. And before you do that, let me show you how to create a separate space to track these, right? What I'd like for you to do is click on all views. Oh, can you go back to the Gmail bit?

SW:
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Sorry, over here, click on all views on the left side. So under, do soon. Yeah. Do that, click on the plus top, right? Over there next to the title? All views?

SW:
  Right here?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. That one, that tiny little one, you're going to get a tray that opens up. Okay. Just click on, call it that's fine. Okay. Over here is where we're going to be doing that handling. So if you scroll down over here, you're going to see priority. Actually, it's the third one. Yeah. So do that, click on the dropdown and then select the newsletter one. Oh, yeah, that's the dropdown. Select that carrier marketing one because that's the one we've just created. All right. Select that apply. Okay. Yeah, just apply. All right. I'm sorry, I think it's taking a minute after you do the action for me to see it here, save as?

SW:
  Yep.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Save as okay. All right. Let's just call it like carrier marketing or something you've got a.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, like carrier market or CM or something like that. You can obviously like change the name at any point.

SW:
  Right there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Do the second radio button, it says all users of this inbox. So now you're creating this comment, so the whole team can track it using the same thing. Save. And what you've effectively done is created a filtered view.

SW:
  All right. So, will that go in there? How would we go to see them under the filter?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It's right there on the left side. If you look at it under closed… below closed. Yeah, there you go. So anytime something matches the condition here, which is closed status and it's marked as carrier marketing and priority, these are all those emails that you've gotten so far.

SW:
  So I could name this like something like for review, yes, and have all the stuff go in, create a filter. Would I do it under priority? Would I just put another priority in there? That? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You just.

SW:
  So on the onset, when the email comes in, they pick the priority immediately. How do they get it out of once they pick? Is there a way to pick a priority that once they pick, it goes away without having to do the extra step to pending or closed or something like that because this works when it comes in. It'll bypass, the,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  unassigned the mind team? Yes. So basically, what I'd say is just recreate the same carrier marketing model.

SW:
  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. I'm gonna answer my own question. If we get new stuff coming in, I just need to go back into here and put the condition in, right? Or, what?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm trying.

SW:
  To do is get AI to mark these when.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  they.

SW:
  come in and then move automatically, move them to a review tab without us having to pick the carrier marketing button.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that's a good point. Yeah. So we can do that again, that would require the AI doing the being trained first. So, yeah, click on the hiver logo again and I'll take you to that AI tagging piece that will basically categorize these as such hiver logo admin panel. Yeah, back out of this and then go to hiver AI instead. Yeah. All right. AI tagging, configure, yes. Okay. Now, add tag. Do you have a tag for carrier marketing? If no, we can just create one for now.

SW:
  Probably did at one time, but no worries. I got all kinds of tags. So carrier, how about if we make one for review or?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely for review might not be as relevant for like an AI perspective. Okay? You know, you're looking at a nine to 10 difference and the AI on hiver will not know which one's your customer and which one's not basically, right? So click on create tag here like this one right below that, and then type out carrier marketing. Basically… yeah, just give it a name.

SW:
  Let's just try carriers for now.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, sure. Save changes. The description gets auto generated that's fine. Yeah. All right. So now, what you need to do and this is probably the most important part at this point. So once you've got these tags created, click on that zero out of 10 emails, that text second column.

SW:
  Yeah. The only issue with this too is that some of the carriers email us back about our clients. So we got to watch that they don't get stuck in there on that part. Yeah, we got to make it more marketing related, but that's fine.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, the understanding here is that most of this would be trained by you being refining it. Like basically you kick it off. What you need to do right now is basically go back to Gmail, find 10 emails that are carrier oriented and add the tag we just created like add the carriers as a tag manually for 10 emails, then the AI basically gets trained on it. So maybe just pick emails that are actual newsletters?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, you've got to refresh. Oh, there we go. It did come up. Sure sorted. You're good to go. You're good to go. Yeah. All right. So this view that you're looking in that's everything carrier marketing anyways. So what I'd say is,

SW:
  well, not necessarily. Some of these are two fa stuff. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay, cool. So then we'll just pick ones that are actually newsletters, you know, that fit the bill. Yeah.

SW:
  And so that's what you do you show it 10 that are already working under that? I mean that would meet those statistics or whatever, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's exactly right? You do it 10 times. Then the AI gets trained. Then it generates a description saying, hey, this is what I think the kinds of emails that should be classified as carriers, are you can read the prompt that it generates or description it generates, change it if you want, leave it as is then just watch AI do that categorization from there. And that's what you need to do every time you want to configure a new tag or a new drop down item in your case, if we're going by just building out everything in priority.

SW:
  Every time I mark one of these as carriers here, it's going through and taking bits of information off of it and creating its own description. Basically that's exactly.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. So what I would typically do is look at the context of these 10 emails and tell you, hey, I think these are all marketing newsletters from the examples. Am I right? In my understanding? Basically?

SW:
  And then what if it gets anything wrong and we take it out, does it recognize that going forward as well?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, definitely. So what you can do, like considering you've given it like three, four examples, could you go back to the admin panel real quick? Like the original one? Yeah, apply. Okay. Yeah. All right. So like X, this out like this pop up and if you see it says applied on six on 10, click that you're going to click on it and that's your training module there. So if you want to remove something, just say remove it and then pull more emails and it'll start giving you that. So once the 10 is ready, it's going to give you that description. Yeah, thank you.

SW:
  You're trying to sell me the product aren't you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I mean, I've been selling hiver for eight years. I think old habits die hard a bit.

SW:
  I mean, the AI part you're trying to get me to keep the AI part, all right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  One percent. I mean, one side, it's definitely going to be useful.

SW:
  No, no, no, yeah. It is, this is exactly what I want because this is what we could also do this to just trying to think ahead how we could use this client related to move it. So all of these, then they would end up in… the box that we had set up over here for carrier marketing, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, one little change.

SW:
  End up in there?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's the intention. So what we'll also do is just click on the three dots against it. Yeah, edit. Oh, wait, can you just click on the name carrier marketing? Just that view. I think we've got to back out of this email, there we go. So now click on that funnel on the top, right? This little funnel here. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, there we go. So now, if you notice we've only got it for that priority dropdown. All you need to do is just include the tag here as well. There include carriers. And now it becomes all encompassing basically… apply and then double tick or just the single tick so that it gets saved?

SW:
  Just the,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  single tick. Yeah. So filter.

SW:
  So, we have to use the filter to get to it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Not really. So here's the difference. So, if you want to run it and if you're transitioning to the tag based approach with AI, then what you can do is basically remove the part that says priority and just leave it as the tag. So, remove that, leave it as the tag and that should give you that quick view that you want for just the AI adding the tag after you've trained.

SW:
  It, these would be the ones that we would come in and review and pull out if we saw anything that we needed to. Okay? Exactly?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. So, single tick again and we've got this logged in.

SW:
  Up here at the top this one. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's the one perfect. Now, this is logged in. So these are the examples you've given it so far. If you want to go back to the dropdown method to get that list again, just switch it out, remove the tag, choose it from the priority dropdown that's your whole list and you can just add it on four or five more emails and that'll get the training done.

SW:
  All right. Once you do 10 of them, then it's self reported. Okay. All right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You do 10 of those, give it like five, 10 minutes of sorts. And then after that, you should be sorted, it'll just start kicking in as itself.

SW:
  But if I want to see the, if I need to pick the other ones, I would put the carrier back in here, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's all the carrier marketing or whichever one that was.

SW:
  I forgot which one it was. I.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Think it was carrier marketing.

SW:
  Yeah. Why is that one in there?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  There was this one? Right there there we go. Yeah, that was the one.

SW:
  There's a lot more in here. Then just don't move tags in there, does it? No?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, no, this is just the dropdown items.

SW:
  Oh, I know what, I was trying to make the top ones relevant. And then I was going to go back and delete the other ones and I never got there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, now X out the tags and that's your filter for the dropdown base list. Oh, apply.

SW:
  All right. So then when I want to switch it back, I just do that. Hold on a second. I'm going to take a picture of that real quick. Yeah, I want to do another training with you or… somebody to, I got another staff member, Chelsea that works with me that knows this stuff pretty good too and has some ideas on how to set some of this up and we just haven't been able to get together to do it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, definitely. I'm happy to do that, Sean. So, you know, I can either coordinate it myself or I can find somebody else on the team who's got the time and, you know, have that going depending on the, you know, the day of the week and everything, right? So, Sean, the first thing I want to check in with you is.

SW:
  I don't want to spend all. I just didn't want to spend all of our time setting stuff up here. I kind of want to make sure that we can utilize the AI to our advantage versus some other ones since we're already using hiver for everything else. So let's talk a little bit about the AI.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  There's one more AI here that I want to mention. You've already got the sentiments and the emojis running in so you can automate things based on it. You can run reporting for it. Is that, you know, something that you'd be interested in doing? Is that something?

SW:
  I don't use any other reporting or any of the, what's the word I'm looking for the statistics? Yeah, I'm not so much worried about our team and time and that it takes to, you know, take care of things just because I see everything. I'm involved with them every day as I separate myself from it more. That would definitely become more important. But like show me maybe how other, if you've been there eight years, you obviously know, other insurance people or other service type people that are using it, what they would use it for or how they use it. Maybe I know that's tough because we don't know everything we do. It's your best shot.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. So, what I commonly see insurance companies and like insurance providers, outsourced insurance and finance handlers do with hiver is obviously, they've got the categorization you've got the priority as like that drop down. So that does the job. Second thing I see a lot of these companies do is have reminders and automated follow ups going on case by case. So, for example, if you've got stuff that has a deadline, then you can have hiver say, hey, here's my deadline. So, as long as you give that to, hiver can automatically send out a follow up two days before the deadline, five days before the deadline, you know, just like reach out automatically with a template message, case by case that's something that I see a lot of people. Do people always have reminders internally where they say, you know, Raghav, if there's an email in the inbox from a client and doesn't hasn't had a reply, like the client's not confirmed after two days of us giving them information, then I want hiver to automatically notify me saying, hey, there's an email where the client hasn't confirmed, this could be useful for your quotes inbox. You know, you send out a quote and usually, people have to remember to go back and follow up on it, right? You can automate that part. That whole follow up can be automated or it can just be a reminder and your team can type out the message and follow up that's another thing you can try out…

SW:
  You know, the one you mentioned about, quotes… I'm adding, I'm adding one of my, team members in here, Denise from the, Philippines. I don't know if she can hear you or me or both, but, oh.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sean, I do have to tell you, I am a bit short on time. We're scheduled for 30 and we're at almost at 45,

SW:
  That's fine. Yeah. Well, let's go over the pricing, then real quick on the AI for us to keep it, or what's involved in us keeping it on the, hiver side.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Just one more AI that I want to show you before I jump into pricing, right? Can you go back to the one where you had the admin panel for the AI and hiver as a whole? Yeah, that tab. Okay. Click on hiver AI on the left side again. All right. Click on AI, co pilot as a title at the top. Yeah. And then, yeah, you've got ask AI. Have you checked out this feature one that says, ask AI?

SW:
  I think we've used this prior, yes, but go ahead, I'll let you do your own.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I mean, the sales pitch here is pretty standard, right?

SW:
  Yeah, you do sales pitch. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, what this is effectively meant to do is help your team drop replies, compose answers and make it better. The difference over using hiver's AI to do that as opposed to gemini is that gemini is going to be more generic one size fits all perspective. So, gemini is probably going to be helpful when you just want to do basic grammar corrections, compose. It better change tonality. Now, the way the ask AI gets it better is once you have this enabled, click on knowledge sources. I just want to see if you've got any documents or things uploaded there. Not yet. No. All right. So, what I'd suggest is maybe throw in some documents. If you've got look at it this way, right? Insurance policies, refund policies, onboarding, policies, carrier based compliances, anything and everything of those could be fed into this as document uploads, PDFS, text files, docx. All of those are supported.

SW:
  And then that will start creating a knowledge base for us.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Future state that's another feature that we've got in the line for now, what it would do is when you're an agent in the team, you go in and you're like, hey, AI, help me write a reply. It's not just going to go by what's on the email, but it will run through these documents that you now upload and give you that correct answer. So it will actually refine the answer based on what's on these documents, you're going to upload and then give you a more clear complete answer. So, what that means?

SW:
  When we upload documents, what's the security position on that? I mean, there's not a lot of information in necessarily deck pages or quotes or policies. But let's just say accidentally somebody uploads something that maybe shouldn't have been uploaded.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. Definitely. So, firstly only admins can even get to the level that you are at right now. So that's the first thing.

SW:
  So, it has to be done by an admin.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, it has to be done. It can only be done by admins to begin with.

SW:
  Okay. All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  The second part of it from a general security perspective, especially now that we're having our customers upload documents and things like that, we're basically double down on security. So, hiver is already GDPR compliant, soc two, type two compliant. We've got all the bells and whistles that you would typically expect from a security standpoint, and that's been increased to include every single AI feature that we offer. So all of it pretty much runs it to same level of security. None of your data that you add will be used to train the hiver AI model across the board. It will only be used for your instance of hiver and for your conversations alone. Okay. Yeah. So that's the perspective. So, yeah, effectively tldr just upload a few documents here. And if you go to Gmail, I'll just show you real quick how you can like use it in case you're curious on seeing what that's like.

SW:
  You want me to do in here? You want me to do what? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, can you go back to Gmail?

SW:
  Over here? Okay?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. And then go to the mailbox one because that's where we got the, yeah, just open any email from here. Unassigned mine doesn't really make a difference. Okay? So you do that little spark like on bottom, right? The square one click on that, and that's your ask AI co pilot. So if you see it starts with two options, just click on draft a reply. It's going to give you three scenarios that it thinks would apply to the situation. So, it's an email is about an invitation. So if you type out one for example, and just enter it at the bottom. Yeah, just the number one and click enter that's you talking to hiver's AI like you would to.

SW:
  I picked this option for it to exactly respond with it's composing. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's the situation right now. If you have your knowledge sources, documents, things like that on hiver, then this would be a comparatively better answer because it's going to run through it for now. It says that the email's inviting you for a webinar at one PM est tomorrow, and it's basically said, yes, I can attend this webinar tomorrow at one P. M. Can you send me the calendar invite, blah blah blah. So as an agent, you just click on that insert button. It gets going from there.

SW:
  So if we want to respond to a real… email, we can do the same thing.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Pretty much try it out. Yeah, drop a reply.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Confirm advice. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  There we go. Yeah. So you can keep refining this, you can just like keep it conversational, which is basically type it stuff, send it out and it keeps making it better, runs through the documents once that's ready, makes it better refines it till you're happy with, hey, this is the answer for this.

SW:
  And that's better than copilot or gemini. I mean, I can use both together though, too, right? I.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  mean, you can technically use both together but the hiver one is definitely going to be better because it's got all of this context. Well?

SW:
  Yeah, yeah. Especially if we upload if we upload as we go away, because typically these would have attachments in there on the back and forth. And if we upload those, it would be, does it read the attachments if they're inside the emails or no?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Not at this point, not out of the gate that's something we're working on. It's. Definitely, yeah, it's something that we have planned on the roadmap. It's just not something you get as of today out of the gate.

SW:
  Okay. Understood.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. All right. So, yeah. So those two along with the,

SW:
  what's the pricing on this stuff or is there a pricing involved under our plan or what changes?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, for sure. So I think you're on the pro plan as it stands right now. Let me just double check that real quick. So the pricing for the AI add on is at usd per person per month as a separate addition to your entire billing. I noticed that you've got like three days. So if you want to continue with this and want to add it to your subscription, I can work on like a discount and have that added for you. So that's going to basically make it at usd per person per month.

SW:
  Is there any way you can extend our trial a little bit and let us use it because I'll be honest. We weren't utilizing it to be honest. Well, I mean, let me talk to Chelsea. My counterpart. That does a lot of this. I might want to schedule three days. If her and I were to schedule something with you or somebody on Friday, could we go over it again? Just a little bit on the features?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, definitely. I mean, firstly, from an extension perspective, I can have the trial active till Wednesday next week. So about more or less a week from today, if that's the price, yeah.

SW:
  That would be huge. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So let me do that.

SW:
  The only drawback I have is that, you know, if we do merge when we do this merger with brightway, you know, I just don't want to be, I don't want to pay for, you know, eight or 10 AI subscriptions because, you know.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  With the whole merger happening. Yeah.

SW:
  Yeah. And I don't think they work with AI on our side, you know? So this will transition more to sales related and the quoting that we have talked about mailbox versus 110 percent servicing. But right now, on the onset, I think it's something that we'll utilize more and more especially if we can upload our data, you know, files and stuff in there securely and create that knowledge base. All right, perfect. I'll get back, send me an email after this, if you would. That way I can grab your calendar. Again. Done. Thanks for that. Like next Wednesday. I'll probably do it with Chelsea or something so we can talk about it and get it initialized. All right. I appreciate your time. All right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  My pleasure. Hope you have a great day. Let's meet next week. And I do have a pretty open calendar. Excuse me on Monday and Tuesday as well. So if you want to meet a little before Wednesday, we can do that.

SW:
  Yeah. Tuesday, I'll probably schedule it. I might have my entire staff on there because we have a standing Tuesday. Call it's only four of us, but I might have them look at some of the features that it can do just to make sure it's going to work out for us.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Brilliant. Let's do that. All right. Cheers, all right. Pleasure chatting appreciate.

SW:
  It, thank you.
