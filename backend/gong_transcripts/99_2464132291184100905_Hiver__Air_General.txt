Jeff Murray - - IND:
  hey, jess. What's happening?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Hello?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  How's your Monday going?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Fine. Busy?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  What about it?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hey, Jeff? Can you hear me?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  I can.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hi, how are you doing?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Doing good? How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm doing good as well for some reason. Can you say something?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah. Are you there?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, your voice just went really feeble for a split second. So, I was just making sure. Oh, okay. Yeah… we've got two people from the hiver side, but I also noticed that we had a couple more on the invite. Yeah. Do you have an idea if Jacqueline and Carl will be making it yet?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Carl will be in here in just a moment. He's out in my warehouse right now. Jacqueline. I'm not 100 percent sure. Give me just a few minutes. Let me, let me shoot her a message real quick. And I know she had a call with Minneapolis a few minutes ago. So just give me a few minutes and I'll see if I can get her on here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All good, Jeff, Jacqueline just entered the room as well. I've let her in. Oh.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Okay, perfect. Perfect.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. Hey, Ken. How's it going?

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Good, good. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All good. It's a pleasure meeting you again with a new team this time around. Yep, Jeff and Kenneth, do you want to wait as well for Carl or do you think we can get some quick controls? Nope?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  We can go and get started.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, perfect. All right, folks. So wanted to kick us off with a round of introductions. I'm Raghav, I'm the account manager for the azure general hiver partnership. I've been with the hiver business for about eight Ish years now, but in this space for a little over a decade, so we'll be working alongside you as the primary point of contact during the immediate phase of getting you started on a regular basis. My involvement in the partnership is more along the lines of commercials, growth, things like that, and that leads me to Jessica who I'm going to pass it off to.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Hi, everybody. I'm Jessica, I'm the customer success manager that's been working with air general thus far, I think Kenneth we've met maybe on a previous call. I feel like your face is a little bit familiar. Everyone else. Nice to meet you. If the other team does decide to join on to hiver, I would be part of your onboarding and training and implementation partnership. Perfect. All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thank you. Great. Jeff and Jaclyn, if you don't mind a quick round of intros as well.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah, sure. I'm Jeff Murray. I'm the new station manager here in Indianapolis for air general, been here about three months now. So just still getting my feet wet. Nice to meet you guys.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Me too.

Jaclyn Guerasio (jaclyn.guerasio@airgeneral.com):
  I'm Jaclyn, gerasio. I am the regional director and I oversee Indy and some other stations in air general, but that's why we're here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, brilliant, folks. All right. So the agenda for today's call was effectively to give both of you a quick little rundown about hiver in terms of how it works as a software, how it's been useful for Kelsey's finance team as a whole and the cargo information team that we've recently onboarded as well. So, before I jump into a presentation and a whole overview of the product, could one of you between Jaclyn and Jeff, give me a rundown of how things work today when it comes to communication and coming, conversations, things like that?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah. So basically all of our accepting agents are using a one login, which is a ind at airgeneral.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Com login. Everyone monitors that same box responds from that same box. So something like this, being able to see who has actually responded, who has not responded if it needs to be escalated and things of that matter, I think that's where that's kind of really going to come into play for us and our team.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  So Jeff, let me ask you a question. Are all four airlines using that one inbox?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Majority of them are using that, Indy at air general. It seems to be like that's our generic kind of go to box. We do have the different, what is it? DL at air general?

Jaclyn Guerasio (jaclyn.guerasio@airgeneral.com):
  There's different addresses for each account. So, aa, at air general, whatever the address is?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah, it's aa dash, Indy or ind at air general, and then DL slash ind… and then, you know, so on and so forth for all the airlines. So.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  What's happening here is, you know, Jeff handles four airlines there. He's got delta, American united and Alaska. So basically, there's five group mailboxes that they're trying to monitor throughout the day, right? So it's pretty heavy, you know, and they get, we're the main handler in Indy. So everything's pretty much going through Jeff and I guess, are they going to your inbox as well? Jeff?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Everything except for united right now, they're still trying to figure some issues out on united side why my united emails? Like once they get me into their system, it should start filtering into my box. But right now I'm still have to monitor the air or the ind at air general mailbox as well. All right?

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  So a little background there?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Thanks for that. Ken and Jeff, you know, with the way the emails are and with just the general volume across three four different groups, what's your team size? Like? Is it just you handling everything or do you find yourself delegating it out to others?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Oh, no, absolutely. You know, we have a team total. It consists of a right around 15 people. So not all of those 15 are going to be sending correspondence or responding or anything. I would say. Probably 10 of the 15 are probably sending responses and things, but everything does filter basically… per SE through me. You know, I have oversight on everything. So ultimately, you know, it falls back on me. If we miss an email, we're not responding fast enough or we just, it falls through the cracks. Someone else thinks that it's been responded to and it hasn't and then a couple hours go by now, we're you know, we're not responding as quickly as what we should be. So having that oversight over all those emails and then having to kind of switch between the boxes because like I said earlier, not everything filters in through my inbox and having to kind of go about and bounce back and forth between those makes it kind of hectic, you know, along with the regular daily responsibilities. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. One last question before I jump into showing you what hiver looks like in my sandbox environment when it comes to automating, which I'm sure is something you're going to be starting to chase pretty heavily just given the volume of things. What would be the, if I may ask, you know, the first couple of things if you had a list that you could choose from that you'd like to automate within these inboxes.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Definitely being able to see everything all in one spot and also being able to… identify if someone has actually opened the email because a lot of times what we're doing right now is someone will open that email box and then maybe it doesn't pertain to them or something that they're doing. Then they'll go ahead and click the not read box. So it'll put it back into the inbox. And then I,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  see where it.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Goes then it kind of gets kind of lost in that whole… little mess of things there. So being able to see who opened it, who responded or didn't respond to it. And then knowing, you know, who I can assign it to or for someone to follow up would be a huge help.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood. All right. Well, I think at this point, that gives me sufficient information to just get started with an overview of hiver at least high level, right? And what we can effectively do is feel free to stop me. If you have any questions as I go along, I will be giving a few scenario based recommendations just from similar teams that I've seen use hiver in the same vein. So feel free to stop me to hop on for more information. Realistically, we'll also plan for like a longer discussion sometime later this week so we can get into the communities and see what that looks like.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Absolutely. All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Passing it to you just real quick in case you had any questions you wanted to ask while I get my screen share up and running.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I'm probably going to get too into the weeds, but I was curious Jeff, how do you determine assignment? Like how a conversation would be assigned?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  So basically, we have certain agents who are proficient on certain accounts. Again, we have delta American united and Alaska. So not all of my agents are trained or proficient in every airline. So as those emails come in, let's say we get one from united. Obviously, I want those to be able to go to my united agents and for them to be able to respond. And I want to be able to assign it to them and be able to monitor that it has properly been addressed. So it's going to all be airline based. Okay, out of the 15 employees, you know, one agent might be on two or three different accounts. We don't have anyone at this time that is on every single, all four accounts. So it's kind of a mixture of the team. You know, this person's on two or three airlines. This person's on two. This person's only on one. This person's on, you know, three. So it's just kind of a mixture of how… so it would be nice to be able to have it set up per airline obviously, but I don't know how feasible that is.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah. When the emails come in, are they coming from a specific domain where you can determine? No? So how do you know which airline it's coming from? A lot of?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Times, you just kind of have to figure it out. A lot of times the subject line will be an airway bill. So we're able to tell a lot of times by the prefix of what the airway bill starts. So, I'll be going through and I'll see one that starts out, you know, zero zero six. So I know it's united or I know certain things or I recognize the name that it's coming from. But we also have it's not just the airlines that we're responding to. It's, also brokers and other agents for other expediting companies and things of that nature that are requesting… arrival notices or, you know, they want to make sure that their shipment has arrived and then how to pay for it and things of that nature. So there's really no specific way of telling what an email is going to come in and who it's actually for. So that's what makes it kind of tricky with how we're operating now with just that one kind of ind or inbox because someone like I said earlier, they'll open it up and they'll be like, okay, that's for Alaska. I don't do Alaska. So they'll mark it on red. And then it kind of goes back into the queue. But nobody ever really seems to kind of go back in there and check those. They've seen one time that it's already been. Somebody's already been in it. So they or a lot of times it'll be addressed to someone, it might be addressed to an actual individual even though they open it up and it's addressed to let's say, Jessica, any one of my united folks can respond to that. But when they see that it is addressed to Jessica, they just figure, okay, well, Jessica's handling this and that's not always the case.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, but it does sound like there might be keywords in the subject line or in the body of the email where we could say this email pertains to this airline. Okay? And I think I've gone through this and created some automations for some of the other teams based on the prefixes… for assignments and tagging and such which Raghav will get into that. When we start to show you the platform, I know I'm getting a little ahead of myself but that's good to know. I think we can come up with some solutions there to help with assignment.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Okay.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Those are the only questions I had, Raghav.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. All right. Folks. Can everybody see my screen as well at this point? Yeah. So yeah, this is pretty much what the hiver experience would look like in your scenario fully scaled with all of your inboxes, all of your groups, and everything included. Now, the way we would be recommending you set up your hiver in itself as an instance would be we'd effectively funnel all of these emails from these different Google groups into one inbox in your scenario. Now in my case, I have multiple for you, Jeff, and for you, Jaclyn we'll probably put it into one. Have all of these funnel in because that's the first step which is everybody can handle everything if they want to. And visibility between email groupings for the team is not that much of a concern. If it is a concern, we can definitely split it up within the team as well. So, for instance, united just goes to Jeff and Jaclyn and Jessica delta, for instance, goes to Raghav and Kenneth. So we do have the ability to bifurcate it if that's needed in a general sense. Though if that's all right. And everybody can see everything, then what we'd effectively do bundle it all in. And as opposed to how you're doing things today, which is red or unred status from what you've told me Jeff marking things with different colored stars and labels is another thing people do. I'm sure you've got a ton of folders on the left side where you file it all under a lot of that. If not almost all of it would be replaced. And you'd instead get this one drop down which we call the mailbox and these different options inside through which you'll now start handling the emails better as a team. So for starters, this inbox that I'm showing you is a central collaborative space that everybody on the team will have full access to. Meaning everybody can see every email inside of here, both new and active and older conversations that have been handled in the past. But the first step here that would be or rather would become important for your team is knowing who's got that email. So Jeff, instead of trying to track it based on who's opened it, what I would recommend is we'd set up a round Robin that's smaller in scenario. And to jess's point, if we're able to establish, you know, who gets, which airline, what it's from, then what we can effectively do is say if there's three people on the team who handle united, set up a workflow on hiver that says anytime email. Comes in from united and you identify it's from them, round Robin it between three people in the team, two people in the team. If it's a one on one mapping, just directly assign it to that person. So a lot of that can be automated. But for now, I'm going to show you how you'd manually go about doing it. If you were to do that route, right? So you pop open an email, you're going to have this entire panel on the right side that's common across the board, drop down, select the person's name. And that's as simple as assigning ownership of a task. So from that point forward, two things are going to happen. One is that email is going to disappear from this queue. So read and unread status no longer have a meaning outside of the individual for, you know, who's tracking it. And instead assignments start taking the lead there. So what I'll do now is just assign this email to myself. So I have that as a I'm just going to go with a different email but quite a few tests running. All right. So assigning it to myself. So now if you'll notice my unassigned will go to six and the mine that I have here gets that one. So that's that distinct space that only shows me emails I need to be handling. I need to be working on now, from here, the second thing that we'd again look to automate right? From day one is going to be the categories that we call tags. And these are basically filters and folders you have on Gmail for like a quick comparison, right? Look at those and tell us what they are. And we'll look at creating them as tags. The way teams typically use the tagging on hiver, is for tracking category. Now, that could be the client. It's from the type of requests they're reaching out to you with. And if you have any additional markers internally that you'd like to track against like maybe which location or what type of shipment they're going for, all of those could become tags. And as an extension, these additional fields that we have as well. So you have more than one way of categorizing thereby leading to better reporting and tracking when things are in motion. So with the assignment and the tagging in line, what hiver is effectively going to do is give everybody in the team common visibility on a who's working on an email because now it's going to have a clear owner. It's also going to give them the ability to share responses in terms of email. Templates. So, if a lot of these are like standard messages, canned responses, mostly just copy paste to get this right data back from the client. You can have these managed as a team shared across the team. That being used the most, you can even pin them to the top. Essentially, what you're doing is making it easier for your team to say, all right, the only thing you're going to change when you send this is the person you're sending it to maybe, and, you know, maybe the name of the airline, for example. So you just let that.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Basically like we would have one right off the bat like that. That makes me think about our arrival notices. We already kind of have a template set up and we just copy and paste it. We change the name and the airway bill and that kind of thing. So something like this, would be really great.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly, right. So that's the exact bottom line here. Now, with the email templates on hiver, they're fully HTML friendly. So if you've got formatting, things like that, you can definitely replicate, excuse me, replicate it. They also support attachments that you can include when you're making the templates, you don't have to copy paste or include that every time. And you can also have your standard editing options like hyperlinks, anything and everything on that front would all be encapsulated within these email templates as you're setting them up. And when it comes to having something very readily drafted and sending it out, the first thing is your team can continue replying from the inbox that they're receiving it from. So it doesn't have to come from Jeffrey ad to Jessica ad, to Raghav ad. It can just come from the team's address. And just like in our scenario, what you can do is have the reply and the signature match to the individual. Because when it comes to hiver, everybody would need to log into their direct email addresses as themselves. That's how we're able to track who's got ownership, you know, who's doing the task, all of that stuff. But essentially, given that you can reply as the team address as well when you're sending it out, that just makes the experience easier for the client because now they know whether they send it to Jessica or to Jeff in the email, it's always going to go to the team and somebody else can effectively pick it up based on who's route. And now comes the second part of it which is once an email is delegated and people know what needs to happen in a standard scenario, that means they type out the reply, send it out. And in a normal Google account, like a Google workspace set up like yours, it's either archive or delete that email. I don't think you'll delete it. So it's probably just archiving, right? So with hiver, those archivals in themselves would be replaced with the statuses. So you've got two statuses to choose from pending for anything that you want to pause, revisit later, set a reminder for and closed for anything that you feel is done at that point of time. Now moving it between the statuses. Again keeps clearing up your active queue. So unassigned mine are only for open emails assigned across the board, right? And this is where things get interesting. There is also a team view. This is probably where I see you spending a lot of time from Jeff because this is basically a full list, all the members in the team, quick filtering options to see who's got, how many emails, full click through visibility, right? Till what's happened on that email till the very end. And because anybody in the team can reassign conversations, re, tag it and all of that stuff, you're going to have that full understanding there, right? Okay.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Quick question. On that note, you said that everyone would have the ability to I guess reassign the email to someone else. Is there a way to turn that portion of it off? Okay? All right. Just want to make sure because I could see where that could go the other direction real quick. So thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, no, totally. And on that note, we've also got an additional sort of way of tracking things as well if I can call it that, right? So on the very bottom, on the right panel, there's also this entire activity panel that I'm just going to pop up. Now, what this does is it gives you a full audit trail of that email conversation in your team. It tells you when was it received? Timestamps, any actions that were done? Who did it? When did they do it? And these are all non editable. So we can basically change it. If they do something. It's there. This is also the space where you'll probably replace any of your internal collaboration in terms of like messaging that you do internally. No need to do internal emails unless it's a top tier escalation. All you need to do instead is just add team member message, move on to the next one. Because what's happening on the other side is whenever somebody adds a note like this, a, it triggers a bell alert immediately. There's going to be notifications that start popping into different team members depending on who's being tagged. You can do an at all if you want to do like a team level alert as well. And it's all one click redirect, find an alert you want to track, click on it. Hiver takes you straight to that email telling you, hey, this is what you're looking for. So no need to search, no need to figure out where it's from who it's for, go straight on that conversation.

Jaclyn Guerasio (jaclyn.guerasio@airgeneral.com):
  So those alerts that you have there, is it like an audible alert and you can't turn that off or is there a way to mute that also?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You've got both the options. It's usually a pop up alert. So that relies on how your desktop and notifications are set up and you have the control at the individual level to either say, hey, I want sound for this or I don't want sound for this. So by preference, you can have that enabled. Yeah. So on that alert front, what it can also do is act as more of a filtering mechanism. So it's not just going to be a one dump of every alert that hiver generates as a team, but instead like in your case, Jaclyn, this could just be SLA for resolution time was violated or you have specific clients whose conversations you can follow automatically and maybe just get alerts for that outside of direct mentions, where at Jaclyn is used on an email. Outside of that, none of these alerts would even hit your regular queue. So, in.

Jaclyn Guerasio (jaclyn.guerasio@airgeneral.com):
  my case, I'm in these group boxes that come mainly from the airlines, like for escalation purposes or even internally for escalation, do they always have to put at the person's name or to get it like recognized in that? Or is it just Jaclyn populates in an email and it will filter into that, those filters you just showed us?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So, depends on the outcome. If it's just about sending it over to you, when it reaches a certain level of escalation, we can just skip all of this and just have it go get assigned to you directly as the owner, with the understanding that you will be directly handling it or taking care of it from that point. If it's going to be more of an fyi saying, hey, Jaclyn, I want you to check this out, see if I've done the right thing or I'm giving the right information, then it has to be an at for it to enter that bell, right? Okay. So, yeah, that will be the perspective there in terms of either having it directly routed to you. So it skips everything. You still get an alert and you can handle it or at when you need to be included on something that's not within that executive inbox. If I can call it that. So. Yeah. And the best part is like everything. Yeah. Sorry.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Yeah. Can you go back to the all assigned? Was that the team thing?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that was the team can.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  We go back to that inbox, all assignees. Okay. Let me get rid of this up on the screen. All right. So, what I'm looking at here is, I mean, I'm not sure who Karen is, right? Yeah. So, a message came from Karen. What is the frt there?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Well, that's rsle, so that's first response timer. If it's in a light color, that means it's upcoming. We still have time to handle this and sort it out and get it done with. If it's in red, it means it's overdue and we should have gotten back to it sooner.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Okay. And what's the sad face?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that's AI sentiments that we've just launched. I think it's about that, that's what it's a feature called AI sentiments that we've launched where basically we're using AI in the background, understanding the tonality of the email and telling you hey the first email you received it's more from like a negative connotation, and somebody who's maybe angry who's disappointed. Okay?

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Interesting. Can you go back to that inbox?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Totally. Okay.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  So, it's AI that picks it up and lets you know that something could be there. The next one is where you've assigned it to somebody, right?

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  The name says who it's been assigned to and then you're putting a code to it if it's billing backlog, whatever, I'm not sure if we need that. All right, very good. So, all five, all four airlines and the air general will fall into this inbox and it'll look similar to this, right? Yeah.

Jaclyn Guerasio (jaclyn.guerasio@airgeneral.com):
  And that time, so that frt that Ken mentioned and you say the color, are we assigning the parameters of that? Like, so if something's not answered in 30 minutes or 60 minutes or it's gonna change color after that?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly. So we're setting.

Jaclyn Guerasio (jaclyn.guerasio@airgeneral.com):
  a time limit basically on that, yeah.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  And I think that's what you want, Jeff that's like, I think what we're.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  looking for is, you know, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah, because, you know, we obviously we're we have that we want to answer everything, you know, a minimum of two hours or a maximum of two hours, you know, we obviously, so we want to, you know, if we could do, you know, 30 minutes an hour and then, you know, an hour and a half, then we know we're getting to that point where, hey, this has got to be responded to and even those tags in the back for billing or backlog or whatever. I think that's probably where we could probably utilize it for each airline, you know, set it up for delta, American united and things like that to where we know what group it's kind of going to at that.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Point exactly. Exactly. And Raghav, if it does not have an frt in there, that means it's been replied to.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That means it doesn't enter these sle timers that I've got. So the one control you'll have on the sles is you can either set up a general timer, set up timers specific to different airlines or just not have timers at all. You've got all of these options. In my case, I don't have a general one.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I have it specifically for backlog and billing and some other scenarios, and that's why only some have it and some don't… okay.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  But you have to assign the backlog or the billing, right? It doesn't do it automatically.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You can. So if you've got keywords, it's based on domains, things like that, you can obviously automatically have backlog and billing and everything added by default. Okay? All.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Right. So we can add something. Okay, very good. All right. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure, no problem. And a lot of this can be done by AI as well. So if you can, you know, you'll give the system like 10 examples train it. You can have AI take over this whole tagging aspect of things as well. So you've got both the options, right? And so, yeah, Jeff to your point, in terms of what happens after something is marked as done, how does that flow look like? So everything in unassigned mind team just open always a reducing list of active conversations, right? Anything that's pending or closed technically gets moved to dedicated spaces called pending and closed. But the rationale for doing that is hiver also reopens conversations. So if today I mark something as done and close it, move it out. Just like how archiving an email and a reply brings it back to the inbox, closing an email and a reply reopens it as well. So it's immediately going to go to and it does stay to the person it's assigned to. So if it's assigned to Raghav, subsequent replies come to Raghav by default. So again, to your point, hi, Jessica no longer needs to go to a common queue. And you have to worry about it. If Raghav handled the previous email reply comes to my name. And the other side of this like from here, right, is also being able to track historical and pull up older conversations with that person today that's Google search for you. I'm sure, quite manual, quite difficult. But hiver, we've got a very simple click icon built in here. It's called the contact module effectively what it does. It gives you historical conversations both from that individual, going by full email address, and from that company going by domain with relevant details. Who handled it last, what was the status of it? What is the current status of it? And all of these are interactable, right? So one click, we've got the whole thread opening up on a new tab effectively. So if somebody comes in and says, hey, I've been emailing you for three days. Nobody got back to me. You don't need to search to find out who handled it, what's the status? None of that stuff, just pull this contact record up and it's going to tell you exactly who's got ownership. Have they marked it as closed? What's the timestamp? All of that fancy bits, right? And from here, another thing that I think would be useful for your team is also the fact that you can now share responses before you actually send it out. So we basically call this share drafts two places from where you can. Do this. You can either do it while you're drafting a reply, you have bits and pieces of the reply. You're not sure about you need to get approval, any, and all of these scenarios, type out what you have, put it as a draft. Rest of your team on hiver can see this. So you'll probably just go back to the notes section and be like at team member, check out the draft. As a team. It's not just about visibility but people can also edit this draft on your behalf, make the changes, modify the information, bundle it back, put it back ready to go out. So, yeah, so from here, in terms of everyday tracking on things and just overall overviews of stuff because one part of it is the operational side of how do I reply? Who's got it? What happens? But the other side is obviously tracking all of it, right? And so that's where the entire reporting and the dashboard capabilities of hiver start standing out. Not only do you get to track active conversations, new conversations, but you get to group it by response times, resolution, time, handling time. And all of these are detailed reports. Like for instance, if I see that my response time is 14 hours and just two people are taking more than 10 hours, I'd want to click through and see what, why is it so long? Like what's the delay? So the detailed granularity on the report extends all the way to individual email threads, specific timestamps and type of responses, duration of response at the conversation level. And you can keep filtering on this using the tags that we were creating additional sentiments, drop down objects a lot of ways through which you can customize the experience. So as you keep growing on hiver in terms of your workflow adoption, you're going to have more and more ways through which you can filter data, track it and also set better alerts. And so, yeah. So that's the reporting perspective of hiver. And even from an everyday perspective, you know, when you're coming from folders labels and tags on Gmail, you probably want to replicate to an extent some of that setup on hiver. So while the unassigned mind and team are defaults, you can configure your own views as well both at the personal and at the team level. So again, to a point of, hey, high priority customers, high value conversations, I need a separate place to tag it, you can basically just have that created with a couple of clicks, gets ready to go. And that way, if that's more relevant on a daily basis, more than the unassigned queue, that could effectively be customized like this. And you start your day looking at the escalations and then working your way backwards from there. And so, yeah, at this point, I do want to pause because there's quite a lot more that I feel would be useful especially from a workflow creation and automation perspective. You can do things like deadline based reminders for your team, automatic follow ups in two days. If there's no reply from a customer of a certain type, quite a lot of those that we can build out. I wanted to pause, see if this has been resonating so far and check for some time for a detailed deep dive.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah, no, I think everything that we went through would be super beneficial even that last little tidbit. So like Jaclyn, even for our undelivered list when we're sending out those emails on that, if we haven't gotten a response back within a day or two, then we've already got it set up to where it basically automatically resends another email. So that would keep Justin from having to literally go through every one of those. And we'd be able to monitor it a lot better. So, yeah, I think I see a lot of the potential for this for sure.

Jaclyn Guerasio (jaclyn.guerasio@airgeneral.com):
  Yeah, it would definitely keep us out of trouble with our business partners as far as notifications go and timely responses. Because I mean once I get into an email chain, it's because it's no one's answered for days and they're escalating it. And I see that. And then it's like I get it because I know what it's like to be in a station every day, but at the same time, we have to make sure we're checking this email. This is like one of our biggest weaknesses within the stations is the emails.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No don't worry. Hiver can make that sure.

Jaclyn Guerasio (jaclyn.guerasio@airgeneral.com):
  Accountability, as far as assigning it, it's holding people accountable in black and white. You can't get rid of that history. Yeah, yeah.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Absolutely.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And if I may just one more two second bit that I want to show you, Jaclyn, you did mention that you step into an email very late in the chain, we've got an AI backed way that basically gives you a neat little summary of everything that's happened so far. So you want to get caught up, you don't need to read through the whole thing as well, pop that in and it effectively in a couple of seconds tells you issues, actions taken so far, current status and next steps.

Jaclyn Guerasio (jaclyn.guerasio@airgeneral.com):
  That's awesome. Yeah, I have right now in Gmail. I think it's gemini is doing that for me like summarizing. I do like that. It's a very nice tool.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Precisely. Yeah. So, yeah. So from here, folks, I would like to set some time for later this week, depending on schedules for a proper four to five minute session. I'd like to go into the weeds of more of your workflows, give specific suggestions and start planning ahead for getting a team on hiver as well. What does your schedules look like for Wednesday Thursday this week?

Jaclyn Guerasio (jaclyn.guerasio@airgeneral.com):
  I am traveling Wednesday. I'll be in meetings Thursday and then traveling in Friday, but I'll let Jeff get with you guys first because it's most important that him and the station get onto this. So whatever is good for Jeff.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Let's see. I'm pretty much good. Any time between probably… one and three on Wednesday… Thursday is not really good at all. We got a ton of stuff on Thursday Friday. I'm pretty well wide open. I've got a couple things in the morning and a couple late in the afternoon, but for the most part, Friday, I'm wide open.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So then in that case, let's probably set some time for Wednesday, jess. I see that our calendar is pretty packed as well. Yeah. I mean, if you're open on Friday, what is like 11 to 12, 12 to one? What is that window?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah, I'm good anywhere in between that time.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. I'll set us down for 11 to 1,145 eastern. I'm guessing, I don't know if this matters, but I'm on pto, oh, yeah, no. I saw your calendar. I was trying to find something. I can fill you in. It's hard, but yeah, sorry about that. You're good, Jeffrey, Eastern Time zone, right?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yes, sir.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, sorted. Yeah, I'll send you an invite, 11 to 1,145 eastern, and I'll add everybody else as optional obviously just not going to be around. So I'll fill you in on that later. Jess and Jaclyn, Kenneth, if you're both free, feel free to hop on. Do you want me to keep Carl as well on the invite for Friday?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yeah, you can keep him on there, sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, sorted. Yeah, let me get that scheduled. Let me have the invite sent over and I'll also send over some collaterals, some videos for you to check out leading up to our call. So if you've got some time, get that sorted out. And, yeah, any other questions prior to our call, drop me a note, happy to discuss in detail.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Yeah. So, Jeff, how many individuals do you think you're going to have on us?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Honestly, probably anywhere between… honestly, probably at least 10, maybe 12 Ish, not everyone's going to need to be on it?

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Yeah, because it's per person, the pricing is per person. So we'll look at that and I already have your pricing because we're just going to use what we have right now. Is that correct? Yeah, you're right? Okay. I'll follow up with Kelsey on that.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  And we can always probably set something up as far as to like, you know, one person specific for each airline, I'm guessing… but, well.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Whatever we think is going to work. So, I'm fine. Either way. Okay. Yeah. I started thinking we'll have to get the names together so we can figure it there. Okay?

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Yep, will do. All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And Kenneth, what I'll do is I'll just send you an email after the call, so that I can get some details over to you in terms of commercials, what that's going to look like. So when you get the numbers together, we'll have clarity about that in parallel yep.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Very good. Sounds good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, folks.

Kenneth Coleman (ken.coleman@airgeneral.com):
  Cheers, everybody. Thanks for hopping on. Thank you. Enjoy your pto Jesse.

Jeff Murray - - IND:
  Thank you.
