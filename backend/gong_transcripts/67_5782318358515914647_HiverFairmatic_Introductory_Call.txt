================================================================================

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  hi, matt. Sure.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Good morning.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hey, good morning, Justin. How you doing?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  I'm in chaos right now, Matthew, that's why I need your help.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Perfect. That's why we're here.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Yep. So this is, so I actually, you guys can thank chatgpt. I love chatgpt. I use it for like recipes excel formulas, all that stuff. And I was like saying chatgpt, I hate my inbox. What do I do? He's like, well, move to outlook. It's not in the cards. Oh, go to hiver. So I started looking at hiver. So I don't know if there's any marketing play in there, but basically, and I want to keep this concise because I'm in eight hours of meetings a day. We're currently using Google groups as a shared inbox, and we have multiple domains or we have one domain with multiple groups functions. So I'm the director of underwriting at a insurance company, and we get anywhere from 20 to like 200 submissions a day. So, in the Google groups inbox, we currently have an AI agent sitting on top of that with an API into Salesforce. And every single email that's sent to our submissions at fairmatic. Com creates a Salesforce lead. And it's if you can see how that can get chaotic because you could have a broker follow up three, four or five times on a single submission. Now, I have five more leads in my inbox. So I'm largely trying to match the native functionality of a shared outlook email address where you can create subfolders, people can color code them. And then it's like, okay, yep, I own this email. Everyone else move on to the next one. Okay? This email is done. I'm moving it in terms to some completed or archive folder. So that's the solution that I'd be looking for. I have about eight to 10 employees that would need access to this and you tell me if this is something that's within your guys' scope or if I'm missing the mark here?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, I think it's within our scope. So you're using Gmail, right? Yep. Okay. And you want these emails are coming into the submissions address that you mentioned?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Yeah. And I can actually just show you. Let me give you a good visual here.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  So it's a Google group. It's a collaborative inbox, which can you see my screen?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can. Yep.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  So, the problem is, so you can see this is our submission inbox since eight, 15 or an hour and 45 minutes ago. We already have a good number of emails here. So each of these is creating a Salesforce lead right now because we have my predecessor really liked AI, but I don't think he really knew how to use it very intuitively. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  What I'd really like to do is just go manually for now in which everyone, all my underwriting assistants who are responsible for managing this inbox, pull this email from Zeb cornwall. Okay. Yep. So my employee Gianni owns this email. He's done what he needs to do with it. And then he drags this email to some folder that says completed or archived or something like that. So really just trying to match the functionality that's native to that look.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yep. Absolutely. Yep. This is the core thing that hiver does quite easily.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Perfect. And it's an extension within the Gmail app, right? We wouldn't be working out of a separate platform. Is that correct?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That's correct? Yep. And I can actually just go ahead and show you it too here. If you want to stop sharing your screen for a sec. Awesome. Let me go ahead and share my screen. Exactly what you said. We're a certified Google partner. You simply download the extension. Once you download the extension, your team members are also going to download the extension. You're going to have these yellow icons in the top right here, and then these yellow icons down here in the left.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Okay. Right.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, you're going to be able to answer your personal emails just like normal. Except now you're going to have a yellow folder or folders down here that are going to be connected to those group emails that you have.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. So, like for instance, here?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Oh, yeah. This looks exactly with what I need.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for instance here, let's just pretend. I think you mentioned you have a submissions group, right? Yep. So we could call this folder submissions every single time somebody emails that submissions group. It's going to first start in the unassigned folder?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, it's unassigned that's going to let you know that you need to assign it to somebody. Okay? And when you open these emails now, you're now going to have this hiver panel on the right hand side?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Okay. And,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  with this panel, you can go ahead and assign it to different people in the account.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Okay. And where is that from a visual perspective? So if you assign that to yourself, what happens?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Exactly. So if I assign this to myself here, I'm going to get notified up here in the bell icon that I've been assigned this and it's going to and everyone's going to have their own mind section of the folder. And this is where all the emails that person's been assigned gets.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  So that instantly went away from unassigned and it went into the mind folder. So I'm not going to have underwriting assistance, duplicating work. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So the unassigned folder is going to let you know, these are the emails that have come in that need to get assigned to people. And then once you get it, once you assign to someone, they'll get notified, they're going to see it in their mind section here. Okay?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  All right. So, so the way I'm thinking about it, so the underwriters would be handling mine. And once they've been finishing, once they've done everything in mine, is there an ability to be like, okay, I assigned this to myself, but I'm done with it now. Can I move it out of mine to some done folder?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Of course. So right next to the assigned, is the statuses. Okay. It's open pending and closed. And if they're done with this, they simply move this to close status. You're going to notice that this five is going to go down to four. Okay. And it moves to a folder which is called, which is called close kind of similar to how you would, you know, imagine like an archive folder. But yeah, you'll be able to see it. Nothing gets deleted or anything like that. It's just kind of like as you mentioned earlier, they're now getting like categorized.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Yep. Exactly. Okay. Cause my cause like I have, I'm looking at, 600,000 emails in the last and I joined my company four weeks ago, and we have a single queue of our submissions and there's 600,000 emails than that. So, I, what I'm trying to do is like, okay, I can't fix everything going backwards, but if I can get something more intuitive going forward, so that, the underwriting assistants have more clarity on what they're supposed to do that'd be perfect. So let's say, I mean, besides just forwarding an email, let's say, matt, you got an email and you're like, oh, this is a bit out of my scope. I need someone else to weigh in on that. Is there a way to, how would I be like, okay, this isn't mine. I need to assign it to someone else?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Totally, you can assign it to somebody else really easily here. The new person will get notified. It'll go to their mind section. Everything's tracked in here as well. So, if it was, I reassigned it, that's easily all the activities tracked down here. So you could see everything. Another thing you can do is there's a note section down here. You can put notes, but you can also hit the at mention button here. Everyone's name in the account pops up. So I'm like, hey, Cole, this looks better for you. Please let me know.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Okay, great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then Cole would actually get notified up here that I've mentioned him in a conversation.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Gotcha. So one thing that I really hate about the Google suite is that, so these are collaborative inboxes. So we have members in those collaborative inboxes, and I've filtered out some stuff. So anything that's sent to submission, so, I'm a member of submissions at fairmatic. Com. Without the filters, I see every single email that goes to submissions and I don't want that, I want the, my underwriters just bringing things to my attention, that need attention, right? Does that make sense? So, I don't want to, is, does, does hiver offer that solution there? So I don't want to see anything going to support, even though I'm a member of support. I just want it to go to unassigned and we'll handle it manually.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, so is there another support email that you're talking about? Another support group?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Actually… no, I just think I answered my own question in my head because I could just remove the members. This is, so I'm not a tech Guy by any means. But I'm just from, infrastructure perspective, the shared inbox in order to have someone to have accessing to a shared inbox, what do they have to have on my side in the Google groups?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, so that's the thing, hiver… is a bit different that way. So, how it works in hiver, is you're going to create a shared inbox, right? You, you basically call it a name, right? Just for instance, your support and, the group email or group that's tied to it is supported. Hiver, helpdesk. Com. Okay. And in hiver, all you do is, once you set that up is you just add the people that you want to have access to it in hiver. So, on your side, it doesn't really matter what your Google settings are when it comes to hiver, because it's basically like you connect the group to hiver, and then you add the people to hiver. So, all these people here are invited to download hiver. And when they download hiver, they're going to see that support folder and they're going to see everything inside of it.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Okay. Can you go back to that view you were on just like two seconds ago? Yeah, I think, I know my actual question now. Okay. So, you, were, there, were you were showing like users here? So, like Aditya for example, so, Aditya is a participant on this. So, if an email is received by support at hiver, helpdesk. Com, that isn't going to go to Aditya's inbox, that's only going to go into the shared inbox. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Okay. Awesome. Cool. I think this is, I've done my own research of you guys independently. I have our it team looking into if there's any like threat assessment or something, just that it stuff to make sure it's safe for us to download this extension. But, I've basically seen everything I wanted to see in 10 minutes here. This seems like a low cost solution. That would be a big lift. What am I not thinking about matt?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, let me just show you some more of the stuff that it could do here. And then also, you know, just a little background about hiver. We have over 2000 customers. Okay, you know, ranging from small businesses, up to the largest companies in the world, companies like capital one, openai, just to name a few. I'm going to put in our, in this chat here, our security overview that you can share with your team. Okay? You know, soc two compliant, GDPR compliant, iso certified. So, we can get through pretty much every, security that we need to here. So there's that you can share with them. So yeah, let me just show you a couple more core functions of hiver here. And of course, you don't have to use everything, but just some of these things seem helpful to you. And then basically, you know, based on what you came to, what you're coming to us for is exactly what people sign up for hiver for is they have these groups, they have these emails, they're getting a ton of emails. And there's just chaos. Not easy to organize it. So, you know, this is the exact same thing. So also there's tags. So this will help you categorize these emails and so you can know like what types of emails these are. And then you can also run reporting on it. So you can be like, okay, last week, we got, you know, 50 emails about billing. We got 50 emails about documentation asks or anything like that. So this will help you categorize them.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  And, these categories can be anything I want them to be.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Anything completely customizable. And then, and then also when it comes to the tags and the assigning part, we can create automations so that they automatically get assigned to people or so that the tags automatically get applied. And the way that we do that is with key, a popular way we can do that is with keywords. So, for instance, if, you know, I'll just make it easy. I don't know everything about the type of insurance emails that you're getting. But basically, it's like, if you on the team handle all the invoices, we can set up automations where it says any email that comes in that says the word invoice automatically gets assigned to you and automatically gets the invoice tag applied to it. So that's another popular thing about using hiver is creating these automations just to automate some of these things to, if possible, so that they can get assigned to the right people and that these tags can automatically get applied.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Okay. So, cause I'm just, yeah, cause from a reporting perspective, that'd be great because I'd like to delineate, okay, how many of these emails were actual submissions? And how many of these emails were like follow ups on submissions that we had already received, that seems within scope here. So that actually would be really nice to have. We do have some other departments. I just, I'm one of, four or five departments here. A little background on fairmatic.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  So fairmatic has been a business for, since 20 21 and, we had 140 employees as of like two weeks ago when, we got a new CEO, the CEO brought me in and my team in and now we have 33 employees. So we're probably gonna grow but we wanna stay lean and I'm, I inherited a mess that I'm, trying to, throw some organization at. So, real quick pricing everything on the website, just, it's a monthly cost per user, that, that's pretty much it. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. We got a couple different, it seems.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Pretty, it seems like, pretty reasonable. So that, that's well within, the scope here. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Definitely. And, you know, where we are is we're easy to use. We're affordable. We also offer 24 seven support, always somebody here that can help you get on the phone as well, depending on how many people you sign up for, you might qualify for onboarding, where we actually will help you set up the account. So we have annual and monthly options, right? Annuals. Obviously, you can save up to 20 percent for signing up for the year up front. Yeah. Two different versions here, growth and pro, it just depends on the features that you need. So, pro is more expensive because it has more features. Yup. And then the other thing is growth is capped at 10 people and I'll include all this in an email to you as well. You don't have to memorize this. Perfect. Growth is capped at 10 people and we do sell in buckets of five. So it goes five, 10, 15, et cetera. Okay. And, the other, yeah, there's a couple of limitations to growth, but, yeah, and how many of these shared addresses do you want to set up potentially?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  So for my team specifically, I have six inboxes that I'm trying to reduce to three. Okay. And it would be, it would be a range of 10 to 15 people that need access to these inboxes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  So, my question is, it seems like, so I have an immediate problem that I need to solve and it seems like growth solves for that. But once I get a handle on this chaos, what does it look like to add some bells and whistles?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, if you want to start with growth for, I think like, you know, 10 people or the, that you have, the only thing is, and it sounds like it's fine. Your, the other limitation with growth is it's capped at three of those shared emails, which sounds like that's what you want to do anyways. And then pro is capped at five, and then if you need more than that, it'll put you in the elite package, which is unlimited.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Okay. So, what will likely happen is that, my chief revenue officer would let me pilot the growth for just my team. And if it does work well, then we might expand to a pro or elite depending if, the other couple of departments at this company could, make use of this. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Great. So, yeah, just wanted to let you know those are the limitations it's all on our site as well. And then, yeah, you can basically, if you were whatever package you sign up for, of course, you know, we make it easy for you to upgrade at any time. So you can always, you can always upgrade, right? Without.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Starting all over.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Of course, it's your same account, it just the new bells and whistles get added to it, you know, the usage limits get extended et cetera. And then a couple other things here. I wanted to show you is the team view, this one? I think you're going to really get like, it basically is going to show you all the emails that are assigned, but open still. So, I know. Yeah. So, I know I have open emails right now. I can see who's working on them, right? Matt has four, Rakesh has six, Cole has two. You can also see the tags here, right? So I can click on anyone's work. I can click on Cole's emails right now. And I can see all of his emails. Okay, right. I can see all the back and forwards on any of his emails. I can see all the conversations when they responded et cetera. That's the other benefit of hiver too is that you will see the responses back to these emails. They're all tied to hiver.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. Okay. So that's, and this, we're seeing, a team between the team, there's 24 emails showing who owns what, and then, okay, perfect. So, if I'm on a specific submission, if I'm like, okay. If, let's say I'm trying to see like, I know, a submission name, let's say it's, Matthews plumbing inc, and I want to figure out, okay, who's working on the email for Matthews plumbing inc? Is there that functionality in here?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Say it one more time.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  So, let's say we have, I, we just got an email yesterday for, a business that we're looking to, convert and it's like Matthews plumbing inc. And I know that we received this submission yesterday because I saw it come in, but I want to figure out who owns it. Who would, is there a way to search and be like, oh, okay. My underwriting assistant, Payton or Gianni is working on that one. We're good. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Yep. We have an advanced search. You can use the search bar or you can use this advanced search.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Oh, okay. Great. Sweet.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, you'll see everyone's here. Like I said, we also have the ability to set up slas, so this could be like, you could set this up that if nobody responds to this to an email, within two hours, it'll let you know that it's late.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Oh, that's really nice actually. Yeah, cause that's one thing I'm trying to figure out is, how do I actually create some KPIs, because you can't create a KPI unless you have a way to measure it. So, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So all these ones with the lightning bolts here are late. They've been, they violated those slas that we have set up.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Gotcha. Oh, that's really cool. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. And then lastly, I just want to show you there, there is the reporting too. So you select the mailbox that you want to see. You select the timeframe could be today. I know you get a lot of emails. So maybe you're interested in today, last seven days, 30 days. I'm just going to do 90 just because it has, we don't have as many in here, but you're going to see things like how many emails did you get to that address in the last in that timeframe? How many emails did you resolve in that timeframe? And you can analyze this further. You're going to see them all listed out down here. You could filter for any tagged emails. You could group them by person so you can slice and dice this data however you want. You're also going to be able to see the workload across the team. So like in the past week, you know, I assigned 128 of them to Cole. I assigned 104 to Yukta, 70 to matt. And it also going to track each person's response times and average closeout times as well.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  OK, great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then with those tags, when you start tagging them, you can look back and say, OK, last week, we got 97 emails about this type of questions last week. We got 39 emails asking about this. OK.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  This is nice.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  All right. Well, matt, yeah, this seems to be the solution. I need more things. So, yeah, if you could send me an email, that would be perfect. And then I'll just have my team do whatever they got to do to make sure it's safe for tiber to have access all of our emails, but generally speaking, this is something that I would want to move on very quickly.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, OK, great. And then what I could do too is I'll email everything to you our security information. And then, and then when you're ready, I can just go ahead and email you a quote for the 10 users of the growth package.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  OK. Yeah, that sounds good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  OK, awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Would it be, would it be all right to just put like a tentative follow up call on the calendar here? Or how long do you think this is going to have to get approved by security? Is this something you want to do by tomorrow or?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  I think I need you more than you need me.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  So I'll definitely be following up. But tomorrow is going to be a little tight if you can throw something on there. Let's just say Friday morning around the same time, if you're available.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I can do it. What time are you in?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Central.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  central. OK. So, I can do it sounds?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Like you're in the northeast?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'm in Los Angeles? You?

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Were in the northeast at one point in your life?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, I know people say that all the time. I could do it. Like… so it was eight o'clock my time. I could do it eight 30. So, I think it's 10.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  30, my time.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's 30. All right, perfect. We'll talk then. Thanks so much, Justin all.

Justin Narduzzo (justin.narduzzo@fairmatic.com):
  Right. Talk soon, matt. Thank you.
