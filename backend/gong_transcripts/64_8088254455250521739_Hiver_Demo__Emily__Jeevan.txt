================================================================================

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  hi, Jeevan.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hi, Emily. How are you doing today?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Good. How are you?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'm good. I'm sorry, I'm a couple of minutes late. It's been a, that kind of morning but thanks for jumping on. Yeah, I know we had a fairly productive conversation at the end of last week and happy to answer any questions, talk through any more information and potentially get you guys started on a trial today. But yeah, want to make sure that we're all aligned before we jump into that step.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that's no problem. We're still waiting on one other person. She's jumping on right now, Leslie… but yeah, we can probably get started without her and then she could just jump on whenever.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, yeah. So the agenda that I had in mind was like I said, eventually, we definitely want to get you started on the trial and point you towards a few fundamental pieces that we can start getting thinking. About. Of course, we also have you also have access to our solutions team in case you have, you want to bring on more people and they need some training or you have specific workflows that you'd like to sort of explore on how to get that set up. We have access to a solutions team as well that I'm happy to put you in touch with. But my objective on the call today is to get the trial started and any questions that, is there any questions that I can answer before we get there?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah. So the trial that I set up last time, would it be the same using the same account for that trial? Like would I be able to do that?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I would say that we probably would not be able to do that because we've got a fairly strict data retention and purge policy. So if an account is invalid and suspended for over two weeks, which your account is, it automatically purges your information from our systems and that's in compliance with our, with GDPR and our other compliance and infosight measures. So we probably would have to start from scratch. I did check before jumping on whether that account was still available, but it does seem to have been deleted because it's over 14 days.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that's okay. We can start over.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's fairly easy. Won't take more than five minutes, Emily. So since you set up the one last time, if you want to do that again, I'm happy to guide you if you can share your screen, and then we can talk through how you can add other people and main items to sort of focus on in the trial.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Let me share my screen.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. You guys see my screen?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Not not just yet.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Oh, oops. Oh, my gosh. This, the difference in sharing screens in every platform is so, okay. You guys see my screen… now? Yes, perfect. Okay. Cool. Perfect. Awesome.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, all we need, Emily, I'm actually going to help you cut a few steps because like we're on this. So, I'm more. So, can you just open a new tab?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Open a new tab? Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just type out, hiver Chrome extension… that's the first one there. Yeah, you want to click on the first link as you can tell, this is where a certified verified Google application, and, all our compliance is mentioned there as well. What you can do is click on, add to Chrome.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And for the rest of the team, this is the one step that they are going to follow as well when you do invite them in a second, but this is the one step that they're going to follow. And, yeah. So, now, this is your, Emily at email address. You want to just click on, set up hiver?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just want to put your information in there. It's going to come to it's. Going to come just to me. So, don't worry about it.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, company number is fine.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Or, okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And then you want to just like fill those in, you want to just select email, yeah, whichever ones you want to use.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  If I select it, is it not?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Necessary, you can just explore the stuff later that's okay. Yeah, you just click connect email for now. Okay. Just continue with Google. You want to choose that, continue. They're going to click select all, scroll down. Okay? Since you've already done this, you can skip this step. You can just click continue.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, now, you've got an account set up. So, this is where you connect your first shared email address. So, here you just want to put a name, put a name in the name you wanted to say on the left. So you want to say orders or you want to say support whatever, whichever, so, you're going to put that in there?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Let's do orders.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, should.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  I do this?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You don't need to do this. It's just the name. It's just the name, the email address comes in step two. So you're going to click next. So, yeah, that's your email. So now you want to click on connect email… yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And you want to, so is orders a Google group that gets forwarded or it kind of remind me, is it a Gmail account?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  It's, a, it's.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  a group. Yeah. So you want to click option two, you want to put the email address in there?

Crislyn Kippes:
  And we're able to connect multiple email addresses to this one. Is that accurate?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We can connect multiple one at a time, but orders first one we'll do. And here's where you can invite your other team members as well. Just put their emails in there. We can also do this later, of course.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Can I do you?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Can do multiple?

Crislyn Kippes:
  Just make sure.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just make sure that, yeah, go ahead. Crislyn.

Crislyn Kippes:
  I think I'm probably not going to join in at least initially in case we have a problem where we're missing emails for some reason or what have you. So you can leave me on it as an option, but I probably will not set it up initially.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. That's fine. We can always add more people later. This is just the,

Crislyn Kippes:
  test run. Yeah.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You can just say, yeah… there are, we will be going through each of these in a second, so you can do that. You can. So this is just like a quick guide on setting all of these up. You can either go through this now or we can do our own tour just in a second.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Can I'll do this later?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's fine.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So now your account is set up and the rest of the people that you've invited, Crislyn, of course, you can ignore the invitation for the second. But the others who want to actually join right now, they would have gotten invitation email, in their inbox. All they have to do is open the email and install the extension. The very first step that Emily did that's the only step that they need to do. And once they do that, they will be a part of the same account that Emily's just created. So I want to do two quick tours. Tour. Number one is on the, is on the main homepage that where we are right now, and I want to draw your attention to a couple of folders over there on the left that have been newly created starting with like sort of assigned to me demo inbox orders, so on and so forth, right? So the orders is the one that you've just created.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right? Orders is the one that you've just created. Email sent to orders will come in here. I'm just going to… send a test email to make sure that everything is syncing and in real time as required. So, I've just sent that email in from this point on. All emails sent to orders will come, will no longer come into your inbox. It's just going to skip that view. It's going to come to your account, but it's not going to get cluttered in your inbox. It will come to this central environment where we spoke about all the functionality last week… right? We're just going to give that a second to get set up?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  So, I think that was the problem we had before it. So you're saying it skips the main inbox, right? And it just goes to this one.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That is correct.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Is there any way for it to just be in one inbox? So we can just look at one inbox?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  The orders inbox is meant to be that right? Where it's one central place where all orders emails live. And the reason why this exists guys, if you think about it, we just spoke about adding more inboxes. So when you're adding all of these inboxes, maybe three or four different inboxes, emails from each of them are just going to go to your inbox and you're not going to be able to tell whether they're from one or the other. What we're trying to do is, of course, you can override it as well. What we're trying to do is give you just one centralized space for inbox, one inbox, two inbox, three. And everything that happens inside there is only related to orders… right? For example, the email that I just sent synced automatically to your undersigned section. Would you be able to just open that email for me? Once you open that email, you will see the hiver side panel on the right. So you can actually go in and reply. But on the right, you can go in and assign it so on and so forth. But essentially, this is something that you would be able to do.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Hello?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Can you hear me?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah, you broke up for a bit.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. No worries. I'm sorry about that. Yeah. So with this side panel, we'll break it down into a couple of different themes, but this is where your team is going to work together on these emails. You're going to be able to assign it to each other. You're going to be able to communicate with each other. And if one person is working on an email and someone else needs to step in to help or to take over this area. Makes it very easy for you to do that. And you really don't need to go ahead and CC… the group anymore. Every time any replies that are made on emails that are in order will have complete visibility across the board even without CCS.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. So we also have other shared inboxes like info at filtrous com and accounting. Will those be separate inboxes as well?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yes, you can choose to set them up or you can choose to combine them. Like I said, I know we had a brief discussion about this, but can you just click on the hiver settings button on the top right, right? There? Perfect? The one next to, that one. Yeah, that's the one right there, click on the admin panel. So this is your section, your way of handling all of the backend stuff. This is where you come to do that. So as you can tell, there's so much that you can do, you can set up the AI piece if required. If you scroll down, you can set up automations, csat chatbots or whatever that we've got to offer on the backend. But first things first, to answer your question, I'm going to ask you to click on the second folder on the far left, which is called shared inboxes, right? So right now, we've got two shared inboxes. We've got the demo which we create for you, which you can get rid of at any time. It's just got a few fake emails in there so that your team can play around with it… like without it impacting your actual emails. But if you want to get rid of it, you can from this screen right here, there's a trash button on the far right. But if you want to create more, all you have to do is click on create shared inbox on the top right of your screen and you can add as many as required.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Sorry, I think I'm having WI fi issues. It keeps jumping in and out. Can you repeat what you said? I'm sorry?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No, that's okay. I'm wondering, is it me, if it's me? Let me know if I'm cutting out for everyone else? I'll make sure that.

Crislyn Kippes:
  No, it's Emily.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. Thanks for that. So, yeah, all I said was, Emily, you have two options, right? One, if you want to combine… multiple inboxes together, we can help you do that. So, for example, can you click on orders for me? Just click on?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, when you've clicked on orders, what you are going to notice is that on the left, there are all of these features and workflows that you can set up one of them and we'll go into each of them eventually. But for right now, can you click on aliases right there right in the middle?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So this is essentially your way of telling hiver, hey, orders… at filtrous. Com is the main account that's what this shared inbox is connected to. But I also want to consolidate two or three other aliases, shared inbox, shared email addresses within orders just so that I can consolidate. So if I want to do that, you want to declare them as aliases, right? Yeah, however if you don't want to consolidate and keep them just all coming into one bucket, you want to keep them separate, which I think was the consensus after our last meeting, you can actually go into the shared inboxes and create separate folders for each of them.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Yeah. I don't know what would be more helpful if all the emails just came into one inbox. That way nothing will be missed… for now. We can let's just merge it all into one inbox.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Maybe we just try with one more that you're open to. I know that last time when we spoke, maybe the accounting one you wanted to keep separate. But, yeah.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah… because I'm just scared of what happened last time where like emails… started getting missed. And then when we took off hiver, all the emails just disappeared… but.

Crislyn Kippes:
  So, Jeevan, just to understand the emails, once it gets filtered into this, they're no longer in our regular inbox. Is that accurate?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That is the default way that this functions, correct? You can change it as always. We want to be as flexible as possible. But the default way that it works is that let's say you are in Crislyn at filtrous. Com. In your main inbox. On the left, the first folder, you will only get emails sent to Crislyn at filtrous. Com. Below that, if you have let's say one for orders, one for info, one for accounting, emails sent to orders will only go to that orders inbox. You can, there is a visual queue. You can get notified when a new email comes in. There are also alerts that you can set up. If something hasn't been responded for a long time. But yes, I understand.

Crislyn Kippes:
  But I want to know what happens? Like Emily was saying, if we uninstall hiver in the future, where are all those emails? Oh?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Great question. And I wanted to clarify that when I say they're not in your inbox, I mean that they're not just shown like they're just not visible in the main inbox section. On the left, they are still a part of your account. So if you do remove hiver, there is no disruption to exactly how your emails are stored or accessed, they will still be a part of your account and you can search for them and they're not, they're never going to leave your Google workspace. We don't store your data. We don't copy it anywhere else. It's just so they're.

Crislyn Kippes:
  just automatically archived. Is that what happens?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly it goes, it'll be an archived or all mail section because the idea is for us to ensure that emails coming in especially to different inboxes they're organized. But like I said, if you don't want that default behavior, you would still prefer it to come to your inbox. We can switch that off for your account.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Emily. That's a, you question?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah, I'm thinking, I think let's… yeah, let's do that for now. So everyone is looking at the same emails and then that way we can get all our personal emails as well and just all in one inbox, instead of going through different folders.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Yeah. Once you're set up, I can ask my team to switch it off. So I'll what we'll have to do is each of you would have to it's a simple step. Emily, can you just go to your main Gmail settings? Page? The main Gmail settings? Yeah. Just click on that and then click on the gear icon on the top left. Sorry, on the top right? That one. Yeah, click on, see all settings… you want to click on filters and blocked addresses, the fifth tab on the top. So this is exactly what everyone would do. So what we do guys, this is the backend stuff is whenever an email is sent to orders at filtrous. Com, we… want to automatically have it skip the inbox. That's what we're doing the middle filter there that's the filter that we're creating on the backend, you can delete this filter and everyone on the team can delete this filter. So that will override the behavior. And all the hiver emails will still have all the hiver functionality, but it's going to be visible in your inbox as well. In addition to the hiver folders… I hope that makes sense.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Yeah, it totally does. Yeah, Emily, did it make sense to you? Sorry?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  My internet keeps going out. I don't know if you guys can see my, I don't know what you guys see when my internet goes out, but yeah… we so just check this and then skip the inbox. So then what do we do for the other emails like support at filtrous? Com? We're accounting. Okay?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, once you add them to hiver, the same filter would be created for them as well. And we can have those. Once you've all added them, we can delete all of them in one shot. And then I can have my team toggle that off. So, essentially, what we do is just to be absolutely transparent about our process. The way the product works. Is this filter is needed to be there unless we toggle something off on our end. And once we toggle something off, hiver will stop checking for this filter. And because when it does check and if it doesn't find it, it'll just recreate it. So once everything is set up, once you delete the filters, I will have my team immediately toggle that off so that it doesn't keep checking and recreating.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. That also sounds kind of complicated.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It's not, it's a one time thing. It's fairly standard and it is only required because it is you want to see it in your inbox.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  And by the way, it's.

Crislyn Kippes:
  not deleting, the emails are just being archived. So you could go to all mail even if you left it on, you could go to all mail and see all the mail from the last day and it would all be right there anyway. So it's a piece of cake.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Spot on. Okay. That's exactly it.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. So we still have to add the accounting email info, support, shared inboxes, correct?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That is correct.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay.

Crislyn Kippes:
  My understanding, you want info to go to the same one as orders, right?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  I think that would be the best or only because that's how we see it now.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Yeah, I think info and support should probably both go to orders as well because that's where your orders come in. Yeah, I think accounting, you might want to have separate because that's where other things, but.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Accounting stuff, yeah.

Crislyn Kippes:
  It's up to you if you feel that orders come into accounting often.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  No, I don't think orders do come into accounting often.

Crislyn Kippes:
  I don't think so either.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah, we could, yeah, we could split it that way.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Let's do that. Let's do that. Can we just go back to the admin panel? Let's figure this out right now. Just the admin panel, click on shared inboxes. Yeah, click on create.

Crislyn Kippes:
  By the way, I will have to jump off in five minutes. I'm so sorry, but I, you guys can continue.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Click on email. I actually do have another meeting starting as well. Okay. Maybe we can grab some more time. I'm happy to jump on and see this through every step of the way, but I want to, you want here, you want to put no here, you want to put an accounting because this will be a separate?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's a group as well?

Crislyn Kippes:
  Yes, it is.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And Emily, you are part of that group? Yes, awesome. That's all we need. And then you can add the rest of them. Yeah, you don't have to keep adding people. You can just select whoever else needs to be in here, I.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  see.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And you want to add more, so now, accounting?

Crislyn Kippes:
  We want to add more to the orders. One. I think that's the, yes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We'll do that as well next, so, click on orders now.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Click on aliases on the left. Click on support at filtrous. Com. I am going to.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Can I add info too?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  One second, And just confirm you are part of support and info as well, right?

Crislyn Kippes:
  Yeah, yes. Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Yeah, just add this as well. Okay. Click add and that should be it. Just go back out and hit refresh and I'm going to send two test emails one sent to support at filtrous. Com, and I'm going to send another one.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  I think there's also, sorry, there's also sales. I know we don't get a lot through sales at filtrous. Com. But just in case… bye bye.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  OK. So, where should I go?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you're done, just exit and refresh.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Exit refresh?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Can you just refresh the whole thing? Just the whole tab just to make sure that all of the changes take effect.

Crislyn Kippes:
  In the upper, yes, great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Can you just click on accounting? So you're seeing one email there? You can just do this later as well. That's okay. Yeah, you might want to do this for now because that's just your email of that's just an email helping you send emails from accounting. So all you need to do Emily is just click on that link, the big link in the middle and you'll see what's up. So once you click on it, it's going to say, please confirm sending email. So, yeah, you're going to just be able to send email as accounting. That's just an additional step that we facilitate automatically if required. Now, can you go back to your inbox… you can close this tab if required?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  OK. Go back to inbox. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Now, click on orders. Perfect. So if you see the top two emails right there, the first one was actually sent to info. If you go in, you click on info, you will be able to see that in there that it is not sent to orders. It was sent to info. And the next one was support, it was sent to support and not orders, but it's in here as well.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  I see. OK. So all those orders are going to go here. OK, cool. And then all personal emails are going to go up in this inbox, right? That.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Is correct. So inbox on top your accounting email in the accounting section and your orders, info and support, and maybe sales all go to the orders mailbox over there. If you want to rename it, we can. And here's the best part guys. If you think that I know we're running out of time. But if you think that, hey, now that we're having all of these in here, but I still want to have subfolders under this one order section one for info one for support one for sales, we can help you automatically filter emails into those sections with zero manual effort. And that's something maybe we can explore on the next call talking about automations and what's possible in this business.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  OK. Yeah, we can schedule another meeting to talk about like csat scores too for sure. And then I'll play around with like assigning stuff because I know once you assign it, you can do it like pending closed, and then that calculates response time too, right? Exactly.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Right. OK. So yeah… I hope that makes sense.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, no, it's. OK.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Anything else before we jump? I know I do have another call starting now as well, but maybe I have a couple of minutes. Anything else I can help with right now? Oh, by the way, the most important piece here… all of this is great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'm going to continue to be a point of contact. We'll keep talking through the structure and helping you like really put a structure around this. In the meantime, Emily, Leslie, Mackenzie, any of you all, who are in the account who need assistance with any quick questions? Hey, why is this happening? What am I seeing? Where do I find this? If you click on the hiver settings button on the top, right? You will see instant chat support right there. 24 seven, wait times of less than one minute, right? My team's actually in an offsite right now. So they're all together. So you're going to get like the best of support. Okay? So they're 24 seven over the weekends through the night. So you can always reach out to them if you have any questions.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Perfect. I will definitely utilize that.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And that's available to everyone on the team who ever joins hiver.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. I think that's it. I'll play around with it. And then I'll talk to Mackenzie and Leslie a little bit later and see what they think about it. And then we'll play around with it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. When do you think we could sort of circle back just to sort of like talk through some of the other things?

  I know we didn't even we didn't even touch upon the admin panel. There's a lot of like really neat things that you can do there that can help you cut down a lot of the admin work, a lot of the manual steps that your team does. So, of course, I don't want to rush this, but when do you think is a good time?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah. Can we do tomorrow? Is that too early? I think I can play around with it today and kind of get a gauge of what we need tomorrow.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We can do tomorrow. No worries. Okay. Same time.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Let's do a little bit later or like 11 a. M 11, 12, one, two. Yeah, 11 a. M Pacific Time.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
