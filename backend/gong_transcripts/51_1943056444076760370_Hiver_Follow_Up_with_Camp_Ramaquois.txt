================================================================================

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, matt. How you doing?

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Hey, am I here? Hey, how you doing? Hey?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Michael, I'm doing well yourself?

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  I'm doing well. Thank you. Happy new year. Hope. All is well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Happy new year. Yes. How about all well with you?

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Everything's good. I think matt kauffman's dropping off right now. There he is.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, yeah, I know it's been a little bit since we last spoke here and I don't think camp is starting right until around April if I remember.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Yeah, we're going to get, you know, actually as we always say when the calendar turns to the next year, last year is or next year is this year. So we are now gearing up as of now for our 20 26 summer. So that's why we scheduled this meeting for now so we can just refresh and restart here and hopefully move forward with you guys and hiver. So, so thank you for taking a few minutes to be with us again.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yep. And, and, you know, kind of recap the last conversation that you had here, right? I think you have one inbox, you have about 10 people that would need access to this. Is that right?

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Correct.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And there's a little bit of seasonality with these 10 people, right? So I might switch different people.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Yeah, it wouldn't switch. It would be like a base of people and then individually, their timing of when they are going to be operational. Let's say will change. So some might be in from, you know, beginning of April all the way at the end of August, others might be starting, you know, beginning of July through August.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, okay, great. Great. Yep. Exactly. And you have one inbox, right? And it's high vault managing high volume emails in that one inbox for the transportation department and kind of managing various, yeah, various emails across that channel all directly in Gmail.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Correct. Yeah, I think we definitely took some time here, you know, took a look at as many reviews, and as many, you know, applications and what other… customers have applied it for. And it seems the only thing we haven't done yet is started our free trial, which would probably be the next step before we move forward. And I don't know if we had a pricing structure based on what we had spoken about. So, I think that's where we're at right now.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. So yeah, you got one inbox and you have 10 people. We do sell in buckets of five. Some things have moved around here. Our pricing has changed a bit at the start of the year. I'm just trying to see here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Do a thing here. Yeah. So you're either going to use you're, either going to do, the growth package or the pro package. Those, those are the kind of two that you would need since you don't need to commit for the year, right? This is not going to be a year thing, right? So you're going to want to do the month to month option?

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Correct. Got.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It. So, yeah, you'll probably you'll either end up in these two buckets here. I'm thinking you might be just fine with the growth version. So we do sell in buckets of five. So you'd pay for 10 licenses. So it'd be 350 dollars a month to use. Hiver.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Great. And as far as setting that up and the parameters are concerned, and then ending at a certain date and then restarting it, I just don't want to be in a situation where we're going to have, you know, continuation after the season and be charged after the season. So is there, you know, whether it's contractual or whether it's you know, set a preset in the system as far as that's concerned. So because we're not going to need it after, you know, August, but then want to restart it again, you know, April 20 27. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. So you stop it in. Let me just write this down. So I have it in August and then restart the following year in April. So, yeah, it's simply a month to month subscription. You can, you can just as an admin in the profile, you can just log in, log into your account and cancel when you're ready to cancel.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  OK. So we would have to. So once our season's over, we would have to manually cancel that exactly. And then we would restart it again in when we need it again.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. OK.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  OK. I just wanted to make sure that ease of the ease of use and ease of, you know, manipulating, you know, not that the product doesn't seem great, but we just don't want to pay for something we're not going to be using for, you know, most of the year of.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Course. Yep. It's fairly easy to cancel yourself. If for some reason you're having any issues with that or want to verify with us, you can just reach out to any of our support emails or support chat, just saying, hey, I just want to confirm that I canceled my subscription on this date.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  What does it take to set this up?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's fairly easy to set it up first of all, for 10 users on the growth plan, you actually would get onboarding assistance as well. So, somebody here at hiver will help you set up, set it up. Other than that, it's fairly easy. You just hit start free trial here. It's then going to ask you to connect that shared email address you have. Is it an address or a group?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  It's an address? Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, it's going to ask for the email and the password to connect it. And then once you connect it, you can add the people to the account and, you know, make adjustments as needed. But as I said, the great thing with having 10 people is that you can actually, you're actually going to get a dedicated person here at hiver where you can book time with them and they're going to help you set up the account.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  And what are the important differences between the growth plan and the pro plan?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that's changed a bit at the start of the new year. Some of the differences are, first of all, the big one is that growth is capped at five connecting three shared email addresses, no two shared email addresses, right? So if somebody comes to me and say, hey, we have four shared email addresses. We're looking to manage in hiver, then you know, automatically that's going to put them in pro, you only have one which is fine.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There's more reporting on the pro package. So you can there's reporting for… tags user reporting, which I can show you. And the other big thing with the other big change at the year is slas. So if you want it, and that's really the only other big difference I'd say is, so as a refresher, what slas are, this is a pro feature is I can see here these red lightning bolts, these are letting us know that these emails are late. So SLA is something like where you can have it applied to all emails or certain emails where it's like, hey, someone needs to reply to this email within a set time or we want to be notified that it's late. Okay?

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  All right. And that's on the pro plan and not on the.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That's on the pro plan. Without the pro plan, you can. So without it, you just basically wouldn't get these notifications here, but you could still really easily see. So as a refresher, you come into the team view, you can easily see which emails are not finished yet. So you still get complete visibility into everything. You're just not going to get those like notifications that this is reached a certain threshold.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Okay. So we're still going to see the all assignees, how many emails are out? Excellent. But we're not going to get, the other feature. But if we're in a situation where we do want to upgrade mid season, would that be something difficult? Would that be something that you, that people at hiver, you guys would be able to assist us with?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly, you can either reach out to us or you can actually just do it directly in your account.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Great. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that's another thing too. You could start with growth and then upgrade if you needed to. So, yeah.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  So at the end of each day, could Michael see what emails have not been responded to yet? Yeah?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yep. At the end of the day, all you got to do is come into the team view and this shows you all the emails that have not been closed out.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay. So, so closed out is different from read, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yep. We're we're kind of moving away with hiver, you're going to be moving away from read unread. It's going to be more, it's going to be more of the statuses. And yeah, right.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  And the definition of closed out is going to be something that was responded to, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Awesome.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  So, we can create different statuses such as awaiting… a response, right? Right? So, so,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  we actually have three different statuses, but there are statuses for that, there's open which needs to be responded to there's pending, which is waiting a response. And then there's closed, which means it's finished. And in the instance that you close something and that person responds again, it will automatically reopen it for you.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Okay, great. Great. That makes sense.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then the other thing you could, we could do, right? As we mentioned here is you can actually test this out for seven days too.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So if you want to test it out and determine which package is best for you that's also a course as well or you could just start with the growth and then we can go, we, you can upgrade if needed, sounds.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Good. So say we choose the growth plan and we test it out for seven days. We're very happy with the product and we want to move forward. What would the next steps be to set up the 10, 10 people or whatever number we have? And then the onboarding process, what would that look like? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, exactly. So yep you would be able to do to you either just let me know or you could purchase directly in your account via a credit card for the 10 licenses. From there, we'll send you a link intro. I'll send you an email introducing you to your onboarder. There's going to be a link for you to schedule a 30 minute onboarding session with them and they're gonna help you with setting up the account, inviting people into the account and then training everybody as well.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  That's great. So training is also included with that. I'd appreciate that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That's great exactly. And then on top of that, we always have the 24 seven chat support. And then also there's if you need to talk if you need to get on the phone with someone, there's, always somebody here. You can get on the phone with as well. So even if you didn't have the onboarding, which you do there's still plenty of resources for you to get it set up. So.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Yeah, I'm sorry. So.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  We actually have, a person who's going to be starting working here in about two weeks and I think it's probably this would really fall under her area of purview. So I think might probably make sense for us to begin the trial once she's here… yeah?

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  100 percent. I would say we're probably would do the trial late January, early February and then make a final decision here, you know, mid February and then most likely move forward, you know, with the plan we just discussed.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. And then we'll help you during the trial too.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So what I would say the best next steps is when that person joins, and they're ready, just let me know and we'll put 30 minutes on the calendar and you guys can join the call as well. Maybe if it's just her that's fine. And then what I'll do is I'll walk her through signing up for the trial and help her with setting things up for the testing environment as well.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  That's amazing. Great. And, and appreciate it. Yeah. And, and, I know we wanted to meet this week because I know the last time we spoke there was gonna be some changes in the new year. So appreciate you reviewing that with us as well. And, yeah, so we're gonna wait a couple weeks.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  I'll be in touch with you. We will set up a 30 minute time for the new person when they start and we'll start getting going. Anything we're missing or any questions that we haven't asked or things that other clients, you know, take advantage of that we haven't talked about or.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Not that I can think of honestly, a lot of, a lot of more things will come to light during, the trial period, right? As we're testing it out. So, you know, if anything else comes up from there, but I think that your use case is fairly straightforward and I think that it should be fairly simple for us, to get you set up on this, get the people in the account and get people using it. So, no, and I think that, yeah, if anything comes up, it'll come up during the trial, we can address it then. But I think that, yeah, no, I think, your use case is fairly simple and easy for us to take to get going, and get set up for you guys.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Perfect. Matt. Any other, anything I'm missing? No?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  I mean, I think the real advantage is that it sits right in Gmail, that's the big thing. And, when we have the trial, we just have to play around with it and see if everyone's comfortable, with the features and it makes sense. And, and then we'll probably have to do a bunch of things on our end to make sure that everything really funnels through here.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  And.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  yeah. I mean, if we're entitled to 10 seats and two email addresses through the system, we might add another email address potentially to this, so.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yep. Absolutely. Yeah. If you want to add another email and then do you have that email ready to go? By the way? Is there a shared email set up?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Well, the problem is, that other shared email is really just an alias. So we'd have to, I guess create a mailbox for it, you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Can also create a Google group too, if you want to just use a group? Okay?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Yeah, we can do that. Yeah, because.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because, those are free, to make. So, you can use a group or a shared email? Okay?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Well, then we might want to use a group, for this email for transportation at campramaquois. Com because Mike, Alicia is going to have her own email address. Yes. And we, so, with the Google group, you could take one email address and it goes to multiple people. Is that, is that how it works exactly?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You, you create the group, we tie the group to hiver, and then now all 10 people have access to all the emails flowing into that group, very true.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  We might want to do it that way we could figure that out.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Awesome. No, this was very helpful. Matthew. I really appreciate you taking the time again and I'll be in touch in the next couple weeks. So, once we on board our new person here, that will be using this ultimately, and we'll go from there. And like I said, we really appreciate you know, all your insight, and time on this. Awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, yeah, sounds good. Michael and matt, and yeah, I'll look out for that email in two weeks and then we'll all connect again and, get you and her set up on the trial.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Thank you very much. Thanks.

Michael Greenstein (mgreenstein@campramaquois.com):
  Guys. Thank you. Happy new.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Year. You too. Bye bye.
