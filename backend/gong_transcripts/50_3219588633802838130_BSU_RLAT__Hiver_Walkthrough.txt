================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hi, Bev. How's it going good? How about you? I'm good. Doing good, hope you had a good New Year's.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  yeah, I did. I got a full two weeks off through the holidays. So now getting back to it a little bit of a struggle, but no, it was good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I swear, tell me about it. How's playing catch up after two weeks it?

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Luckily, this time of the year, everybody seems to go on break a little bit, so it's not as crazy as it normally would be. But still, I've been answering emails for a full two days almost so.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm sure. But I'm glad we could meet. I'm not going to take up too much of your time today outside of just understanding where you're coming from expectations. So the primary agenda was effectively just to hear where you're coming from requirements, use cases, challenges, gaps, things like that showcase like a high level overview of hiver because I'm not sure if you've seen the platform so far?

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  I have not.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay, cool. So I'll show you an overview of hiver and then we'll plan next steps. Yeah.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Perfect. Sounds great.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So, I'm just going to check in from the invite. Do we know if Lucas is also going to be joining us?

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  I believe he is. Let me, I'm just going to check in with him.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  We can go ahead and get started. And then if he shows up a little bit through, it's no big deal for.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. All right. Perfect. So that's it from the hiver side. Unfortunately, Jessica is not going to be able to join us today. So, yeah, I'm Raghav, pleasure meeting you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Nice to meet you. I'm going to be working with you as your point of contact during the trial. I've been with the hiver business for about eight years and counting now. So when you're quite a bit and yeah, I worked with some of the earlier initial teams of boise state when they were checking out hiver, so excited to kick things off. Awesome. Beth, could we, could you tell me a little bit about what you do at boise state and then transition into where you're coming from what challenges you're looking to solve for things like that?

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Sure. So I am, my technical position title is program manager for research compliance. And so we have the animal research side of things and then the biological research, biological materials side of things. So I basically am in charge of both of those programs. And so what we have mail drop accounts for both of those programs. The biological materials side is pretty easy to organize because it's just myself and Lucas. So that's not a big deal. The animal side is quite a bit trickier because we have, let me think we have five people who use that mail drop account regularly, and then another person who is in there periodically. So the animal care account would be the one we would most likely be wanting to utilize hiver for. And so we end up getting right now, the process we use is we receive an email in the inbox and we label it with a person's name. Hey, Lucas, hi.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Lucas.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Hello?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Nice to.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Meet you. I'm just describing our current process with animal care and how it can be a little bit of a headache with as many hands as are in it. But so we currently use labels pretty extensively. So we have everybody's individual name, and then we have a label that says like in progress or fyi or those sorts of things to try to kind of filter through. I would say we do an okay job of keeping track of stuff that way. But I do think there could be a more efficient way to utilize it. And then from speaking with folks from osp, it sounds like with hiver, you can have like side discussions regarding a certain topic regarding emails, which I really think would be beneficial in our animal care account. So anything else you want to know? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. I mean, there's quite a few things I'd like to know, but to kick it off from here, Lucas, do you also take care of the animal care account with Bev?

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  Yes. Yeah. I'm one of the people, one of the several people as I'm sure she was saying that, look at it daily several times a day.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Makes sense. So in terms of understanding a bit more of your workflow, I know using labels to add ownership of some form or manner is a great way when you're just using Gmail. Now that you are looking at having a collaborative space or a shared space like hiver, has there been any kind of thoughts in terms of what you'd like to improve upon given your current setup? Like is there things you want to automate? Are there things you'd like to track better?

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Yeah. I think all of the above. The big one I would say is like I'm trying to figure out how to describe it, how Lucas and I could not be on call 100 percent of the time. So that's one of the big ones. So some sort of automation or like filtering into someone's inbox so that we don't have to be sitting there labeling every email that comes through. That would really help us out a lot, I think.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. And, and how many people apart from the bolt of fuel would be manning that inbox and taking care of stuff inside?

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  So there are it's Tara, aspen, Katie, matt, myself and Lucas. So, so four others?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, six people total. Makes sense. Yeah. And every single person gets emails that they need to be working on or is supposed to get stuff assigned to them, I'm guessing.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  Yeah, yeah. Everybody gets everything. Yeah. But then we go in and assign them ourselves.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. And then sometimes.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  There are emails that require multiple people to touch in the same. So it's not always like one goes to me and one goes to Lucas. Sometimes both of us need to work on it. Sometimes sometimes everybody needs to work on it. All six of us, sometimes just one or two. So, yeah, makes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sense. Now that's perfect. And in terms of the process in itself right now, let's say email comes in, it gets routed to the same person automatically. What would you typically do afterwards? Like what does your handling process look like for that email? So.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  We receive the email, whoever is in the inbox at the time puts the label on it, leaves it unread if it's not something that whoever is organizing it is dealing with it. And then it just sits at the top of the inbox until that person deals with it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And when you say dealing with it, what I'm basically trying to understand is, are there other tools you want to refer to get that information? And do you write out email replies? Do you pre draft responses somewhere that's the kind of stuff I'm interested in?

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Gotcha. So probably less so than like an osp. I would say we would, some automated responses would be good, but we don't really pull in from anywhere Lucas, can you think of any, no?

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  I was, I would agree. I would say for the most part, we have to draft pretty like unique responses. But to that end, I also think templates wouldn't even be necessarily the worst idea because there are a lot of responses that are unique per SE, but they still have, you know, like the fundamental like the bones of.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Like,

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  similarly between email to email. So I think we could still benefit from, you know, some sort of like universal template. It definitely wouldn't be all encompassing. We do send, we send a lot of unique emails as well. But I do think that could be helpful for.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. And the last part before I switch screen share screen and show you like a little bit of hiver as well is in terms of the overall categorization of these emails, given a chance or given a choice, how would you like to categorize them? What are the stuff that you're looking at?

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  I would say we… could go a couple of different ways. We could go like program focused. So label them like iacuc program focused emails. And then we could let the other category could be like animal facility, animal care, like veterinary choices. The other option we could do is just people like have that like whoever is named in the email, it could go to that category.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Okay. That makes sense. That's about enough information for me to kick off a product walkthrough of hiver. So I'm going to do a little bit of show and tell, you know, when my screen's up and running and we should be good to kick things off there. Yeah, yeah, perfect. Yeah. So, yeah, folks. So this is what the hiver experience would look like fleshed out at scale across multiple departments and teams. And whatnot in your scenario, things are going to be comparatively a whole lot more simpler and easier on the eye as you get things off. Now, a couple of things to remember when you're thinking about hiver is that each person once hiver is active would sort of log into their respective Gmail accounts. So you don't need to share passwords. You don't need to worry about forwards to your point, Bevan, Lucas read unread colors of stars, colors of labels. These are all going to be artifacts you leave behind in 20 25, right? So with the hiver route because you're logging into Gmail as yourself, that immediately lets hiver create that level of ownership. That clarity on who's got a handle on this email. Now, in terms of a general flow, what happens is firstly your Gmail inbox is not going to be cluttered with the team emails because that's usually the first thing people ask me, right? You go into your account, what happens then? So what effectively happens is unless or until an email is assigned to you as your task and it's marked as active because we do have a way to track completion of that email as well as long as it's marked as open in that status as we call it. Only in that case, would it show up in your Gmail inbox? Now the moment you mark it as closed a result or pass it to somebody else as ownership, it's taken out of your inbox. And this is the default that happens right out of the gate. Additionally, what you can do is you can even stop that from happening. Meaning you can keep all of your animal control emails, for instance, inside that inbox that we'll be creating. We call this the shared inbox space basically. So that could be the only place where you see team emails. And your Gmail inbox can pretty much be like nothing changed. And just for your private emails, direct email stuff like that. And the second thing is that it's going to be how you handle the whole process based on what we discussed, right? So now, running through what I heard from the both of you so far. Email comes in. The first thing you want to do is make sure it's assigned or passed on to the right person as ownership. Now, I'm assuming that ownership is also defined by the second part of it which is the category, the services, things like that. Now we can either use a combination of both or to kick it off. We could keep it straightforward and basically have hiver automatically do this part. I'm showing you the manual route of doing it before I jump into the automatic creation page. Sorry, the automation creation page. My brain's still recovering from the holidays, but yeah, that's effectively how you go about it. So again, no need to add additional labels. No need to track red or under status, pop in either single email at a time or bulk select the owner from the dropdown. It's about as simple as that. Now, what effectively happens within the hiver shared mailbox space is these little views that you see unassigned mind team again defaults that you can customize. But effectively these all act as differentiators. So effectively different queues for you to go and see who's got what conversation, who's working on. What? Now, when something is assigned to you, it shows up in the mind for each of you individually. So that's more of a dynamic space. Unassigned is going to be the common queue. And that comprises of every new email.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, inbox. And just give me one minute. I think I'm dealing with a bit of bandwidth. Oh, folks, can we disable video if you don't mind for the both of you? Yes, that's.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  totally fine. Thank.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You so much just going to refresh this as well. Just a quick second. And there we go. Thanks for catching up. Again. All right. So you'll park emails under the respective owner as their name, it starts showing up in the mind view. Pop it open. And what you now have is a easy quick way for each person to know what's their tasks, what should they be working on and how should they be handling it. Now comes the process of sorry, no.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  That's that is really cool. I really like that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, brilliant.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  Bev. I don't know if you have like similar questions, but I'm mostly just wondering in regards to like integrating this into our animal email, animal care email specifically, as opposed to like our individual emails just for, you know, because we have like, the overall hub that everything goes into, whereas this seems like it's set up within our individual emails. But I mean, would it work functionally the same way if we still wanted to have like that one overall email that we all have access to, or would we have to change like fundamentally change how we receive emails?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh no, Lucas. I'm sorry, I understood your question a little earlier.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  No, that's okay. Yeah, yeah. I tried to phrase that correctly for.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. So effectively, what happens in the backend is your animal care email is what will be setting up as the shared mailbox itself, right? Your groups, your mail dropping lists, all of that becomes the backend. And it's just the way you're interfacing and using hiver that your personal account comes into play.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  I got it. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So, yeah, you don't have to change. Things can work as they are today. So from here, email is assigned, you know, who the owner is. Next thing probably that you'd like to do is start tracking the other categories and the metrics that you want to do. So talking about categories in itself. Again, there's a couple of ways in which you can track those categories on hiver. One is called a tag and look at the tag as more of an overarching label on Gmail, kind of like the parent label when you're like trying to create a folder because the tags would effectively act as a quick reference means of knowing what type of conversation it is, who is it for, what is the action that needs to be done? Teams use it with a lot of different outcomes expected. And the different veterinary services for instance, could be drop downs like this, where you track and market pertaining to the conversation, you can have as many or as little of these categorization mechanisms on hiver as you please, right? And this can be automated as well. Again, so if you want to look at the subject line and tell, hey, hiver, if it says customer reference call, then I want the email to be tagged as feedback, completely doable, totally automatic. Yeah. So once the categories are done, you've got the right owner. This is where the status comes in and it's also on the right side got open as default for anything new pending. When you want to post off and close, when you want to mark something as resolved and move it to the back of the pile. The place where it gets interesting is that the unassigned the mine and the team view would only track open emails or show you just the conversations that are open. And so when you're looking at emails like this between the six of you, this team view that I've opened up is the best place you go. There. You get a list of each individual with how many conversations they've individually got that they need to be handling. Everybody has full visibility. So that again, does not change from how you're working today. Meaning irrespective of who's got ownership, everybody in the team can see a conversation jump in participate and take it forward from there. But on the team view on the other hand basically gives you a quick way to know what the spread of volume looks like. And also who's got how many without having to open a bunch of things… and click on all views. You've basically got two more options, right? You've got a pending and a closed view as well. But the reason we don't show them by default in Gmail. Is because hiver takes care of reopening them. Basically today, when you archive an email and the same thread gets a reply, the whole thread gets opened back up in your inbox, right? So hiver follows a similar logic which is any email that's pending or closed will be automatically reopened and retain the owner, which means it'll stay assigned to the same person when there's a follow up reply. So that makes it easier for you to not worry too much about, hey, these are closed emails. I need to archive them. I need to get them out of the way. But instead, when you're just typing out your response and sending it over, you'll be able to send out the response and park that email under relevant status as well. I'm just going to take a quick pause to see if you're both tracking along so far. And if there's any questions as well.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  I think it looks awesome because that is a little bit of an issue right now. When we archive something, we usually mark it as done. So, then we label it as done in our current Gmail. And then if it pops back up, somebody has a response later on, it's marked as done. So there tends to be some confusion as to whether it's been dealt with or whether it still needs to be dealt with. Again. So this is really handy that it automatically does that for you. I like that a.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  Lot.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  Right. Yeah. I also really like just noticing up in the top right corner, it says first response due by eight, five PM January. I think that that's really nice and something that maybe is a bit of a struggle within our animal care email as well. Is not having any idea at least if nobody's responding, not having any idea when the last time something has been worked on in that email. So to have something like first response due by lets us know that it's like, okay, whoever is working on this has set this deadline for this. And then if it's overdue, we have the opportunity to reach out to somebody and been like, hey, just wanted to check in on this. It looks like the response is overdue. I think that's really helpful for us keeping track of those things.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. Great to hear adding to that. You also get an entire audit trail of what's happened on that email conversation since hiver. So you get to see all the list of changes, clear date and timestamps along with the person doing action. So if somebody changed ownership, you get to see that categorization replies the whole thing. So in addition to having the due soon and all of that, you'll also still be able to go right down to the granular detail of all right, Raghav changed the priority to this at 1,145 today. So having that acts as a good backup whenever you need to like dive deep and find out, hey, why is this conversation stuck when it should be done, right? And this is also the place where you come in to have that internal side chat or internal discussion that you were talking about. Bev. So the notes section here is basically where you go at. In this case, let's say I want to bring in Jeevan, and maybe pavita, well, let somebody else from the team effectively type out the message, tell them what you'd like for them to do on that email and just drop that in all as straightforward as it gets. Now, what happens is on the receiving end, be it an email being assigned to you or somebody mentioning you on a note? Like I just did, all of those will start filing under the central bell icon on the top here. You're going to have a way to categorize this and ensure that it shows you the type of alert you want to see. So that way the pop up is just going to be for at mentions in my case while all has like that entire list of everything that's there. So for instance, if I get an alert like this, I'm tagged on an email, somebody needs my help. I just find the alert, click on it. And immediately I'm on that email without again having to search through a bunch of stuff before getting there. So that again, makes that process of going from, hey, I need your help to, hey, I've got it to, hey, this is done, all of that more straightforward on there… coming back to the replying side of things. Oh, and yeah, last thing is that everything you do on hiver, especially on the right panel specifically is fully private, which means the internal notes are obviously internal. So are the assignments, the tags, the statuses, and the whole lot. So that also ensures that your conversation stays conversational without introducing too much complexity. There. Now, when it comes to the actual reply side of things, there's a couple of interesting options you can use here as well. Now, firstly to the initial point that Luke made which is you could have general templates that are overarching in a sense of it with small angles or small details that are changing. We basically could set up the entire thing in that sense of it. So the standard messaging, a lot of that standard answer stays the same but you still have the ability to like I'm doing type out on the fly insert. And it then becomes like a complete email or a complete reply at least that's ready to go out. So templates are going to be central to every hiver user, but you can control visibility of that template as well depending on your preference. There. The place where it gets interesting when it comes to responding using hiver is we also ensure that you never have to do any kind of internal forwarding notes is usually one of the ways where people address their internal discussions… DMS and stuff like that. But on the other side of it, I'm sure you're also forwarding some emails between the six of you or just letting them know, hey, this is the email, go search for it. This is what we need to do now with the shared draft, you not only get a way to see what your team member wanted to reply as a draft, but you can also make it a space where you all edit bits and pieces of the answer to create that complete response. So whenever you type out something, put it as a shared draft. Like this. Your whole team can participate by editing the draft, making the changes they feel needs to be done, putting it back into the draft mode till you're comfortable and feel like, all right, this is now complete email, complete reply. Good to go right. So that's another fascinating thing that I thought you'd find useful within the reply side of things. And the last part is again, another common question people usually have is when I'm replying, where is it going to come from? Right? So you can and will be able to retain the email replies as originating from your team address. So even though you're connecting and signing into your personal account unless you intend to send it from your private email, you don't necessarily need to do that. Then we can have any email going to animal control, getting a reply from that relevant mail drop list. Yeah. So on that note, another quick pause here before I dive into a bit of the workflow builder, the automation part. I think I'm good, Lucas. Yeah.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  I just had a quick question. It's not even something we really run into all that often at all, but if it is bringing somebody in who maybe isn't necessarily within the group itself is just forwarding still the way to go about that. Right? If we're just trying to loop someone in who's maybe not in the animal care email, what would that look like? No?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's a great question. Now, this person being looped in, do they need to send a reply or is it more to just view the email and maybe pass comments back to your team?

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  I would say probably more than anything just to pass comments back and forth. Maybe not so much replying all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right then, in that case, we actually have another aspect like a feature on hiver called collaborators. Basically anybody that's on the boise state domain with you all can effectively be added as a collaborator just for that one single conversation. So, what happens here is you type out them, you invite them as the collaborator piece over here. What happens is they get a forwarded copy of this email. It's going to be a view only email. They'll have to log in, ask themselves to authenticate and view that email. And they will be able to leave these same hiver notes back to your team. And once you feel you're comfortable and you feel like, all right, they've done their part, you can even stop sharing of that conversation.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And that way you have full control people just see that email conversation. They don't see anything else without clogging up their inbox. Again. And secondly, you don't need to keep an eye on internal forwarded email replies to know what needs to be done. That can just flow back into the right panel as a hiver note clearly mentioning, hey, this was dropped in by Raghav who's not part of the team, but this is his feedback, right? So you can totally do that.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  No, that's great. Thank you. That's super helpful. Yeah, good question.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Lucas. Brilliant. Okay. So with that said, now let's talk a little bit about how you can organize things on hiver. So this whole all views panel that I opened up is where you go to customize the experience, and again to your point, if you'd like you could use your categorization as a means for knowing which of these are fields that are pertaining and are relevant for you as an individual, you can basically have that reorganized in a way where you start your day straight on the type of conversations that make the most sense for you, right? And so with that said jumping into the automated automation creator side of things right over here, you're looking at a builder that you can consider Gmail filter creation as a good logic to start from effectively a whole lot better and with a lot more options. So, one of the scenarios we discussed was if you get an email from somebody and it's got a certain like a certain category. And what you can do is if you're using the tags for categorization, you can be like, hey, if there is check if the tag that's been added is urgent issue, right? And after the tag is added, I want you to check if, sorry.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  So you,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  can base it off of your category same tag. All right. So be like, all right. If the tag is any of urgent or escalation, and, you know, it's been let's say 24 hours, 48 hours since you heard back from the external party, right? The vendor, the team member, whatever be that case, be like, hey, hiver if it's urgent and there's been no response in 48 hours. I want hiver to send out a template of response. Just for that particular scenario, you can automate all the way down to follow ups, going out like this, reminders, going out like this and even set it up in a way where after the follow up, hiver also reassigns that email to a different person, flags it as a high priority, anything and everything of that sort, right? That's just a quick example of the workflow builder here in terms of, you know, setting up better mechanisms for ensuring you don't have to manually set up snooze reminders and then track that email because that's typically what people do there.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So hiver can take care of that part. You can also keep it more straightforward which is when an email is received, it's coming into the group. I want hiver to check the subject, the body of that email, the condition, right? All of these are options you can use. So to another example we were talking about, you can probably use the nature of the query itself and be like, hey, if it says veterinary urgent on that email in somewhere in that body, then I want hiver to categorize this as urgent when it's being sent to the team itself, right? So that way, by the time anybody in the team sees it or gets assigned to it as well, it's already pre categorized and they know what type of email they're getting without even having to open that, right? So that quick little piece of information can also be used to automate a lot of stuff on hiver starting with categorization. And so, yeah, on that note, that was pretty much the overview that I wanted to cover about hiver at least given today's, context of the call. Is there like there's quite a lot hiver can do in general? So I wanted to see if there's any other scenarios that probably popped in mind when we were talking about all of these things so far?

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  Yeah. I mean, I feel like all the scenarios that I could think of obviously, you know, things come up as you're working with it, but it sounds like for the most part, I think the best thing is that it sounds like there's pretty much an answer to whatever question or concern we might have, which is the biggest thing for us just because I feel like there is a lot of there's a lot of things that will show up in our email box that's maybe something we haven't dealt with before and we have to figure out something new. So I think that's something that sounds like a really big benefit with the use of hiver, is that it is so flexible in the case in the sense that we can kind of… roll with the punches and adjust to it as necessary. And I think that's something that's really useful for all of us. So I think this is great. I think it sounds really useful.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Yeah, ditto.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. All right. Brilliant. So yeah, folks, I mean, in terms of next steps, what we'd typically do is basically get your team started on a hiver account, do the connections and do a bit of training onboarding, make sure everybody in the team as well knows how to use hiver and then from there continuously optimize on usage. So, yeah, before we jump into next steps, Bev and Lucas, I was looking to find out if you had any clarity on the commercial front in terms of what that looks like. Have you had that discussion approvals?

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Briefly. So, yeah, I do need to follow up on that. My supervisor wanted me to just get a demo and see if it was something we were even interested in at this point. Lucas, I think you feel the same way as I do that it's something we probably want to pursue. So let me follow up with who I need to follow up with and then we can, I'll reach out and we can set up next steps from there, brilliant.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. That sounds like a plan. And if it's easier, if it helps, I could send over like a quote that will tell you what the commercial angle of it looks like as well, just so, you know, when you have that discussion, it's easier.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  That would be very helpful.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. Let me do that. So six people, right? Just to reconfirm that's correct? Brilliant. All right.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  And then I guess sorry to interrupt you if we added more people in the future, maybe I don't know how much clarity you could give on the price increase per person. I don't anticipate we would have a bunch more people, but two or three within the next three to five years would probably not be out of the question all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. That makes total sense. So we actually have like a central contract with boise state across the board. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to confer with my team in terms of what that pricing and that contract looks like. And that's the base that I'll be using to send you the pricing options. Now in terms of future user additions, you're going to be on an annual contract. So whenever you'd like you can add more people and you can pay for them as you go. So six months into the contract, you add somebody new, you're just going to be charged for that remaining six months to renewal, and then progressively from there, so.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  Kind of to add on to that too. I imagine this probably wouldn't be a huge concern. But what about like changing licensure from one person to another, right? Say that like someone leaves and we find someone else for a position or whatever might happen? What would that look like that?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Again, it's pretty straightforward as replacing the license on hiver. So for instance, if you're changing me out of the picture, then you can remove me from your hiver account, add in my replacement. And that should take care of the commercial perspective of it on the handling operationally side of things. Once you remove a person from your hiver account, anything that's been assigned to them as ownership gets unassigned. So whenever there's a reply on something that was assigned to a person that's left the company, it basically comes up to the unassigned queue and the next person can take care of it and ensure that there's somebody still handling this.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  Okay. So would they just to make sure I'm understanding it correctly, like the person that takes over, would they automatically be assigned all of the things that were assigned to the other person or would we have to go in and manually reassign those? You?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Would have to go in and manually reassign. Okay. I.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  don't imagine that's going to be a huge concern just wondering.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. No, totally. Okay. So with that, Bev and Lucas, I think we're good for today as well. Thank you so much for hopping on the call as next steps for me before the end of day today. I'll be sending over the pricing information, the recording of our call today and some additional collateral that'll help you understand a bit more about hiver. And Bev. I was wondering if we could potentially throw in like a 15 minute check in call the week of the twentieth of January just to see what the approval looks like. And you know, where we can start planning next steps.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Yeah, I think that will work. I am out on Mondays. But other than that, I'm I should be pretty flexible. So if you just provide a few times, I'm sure I could find something.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  All right. And I'm here on Monday. So even if Mondays are the only thing that works, I'm sure we can, I don't mind doing that as well and just passing on whatever.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. So right now, my Wednesday, the 20 first looks very open for one to five eastern.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Let's just do… let's do two o'clock eastern. So that would be noon our time all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Got it. Okay. Perfect. So, those were the only other two action items from my end before we wrapped up. Thanks again, to the both of you for hopping on. Feel free to write back to me on email if you have any questions, and I look forward to getting your team started on hiver.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Thank you so much.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Have a great day folks.

Lukas Fontes (lukasfontes@boisestate.edu):
  Bye, thank you, Raghav, we appreciate it.

Bev Montgomery (bevmontgomery16@boisestate.edu):
  Appreciate it bye.
