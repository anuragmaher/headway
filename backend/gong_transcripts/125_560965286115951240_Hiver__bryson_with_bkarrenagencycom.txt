Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Bryson. Hi, can you hear me?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Hey there, how we doing?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm doing good. Bryson, how's it going for you?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Going good. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, Bryson. I am dealing with a bit of a cough, so I've got a box of tissues, which means I'm going to be video off, hope that's okay?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Okay, sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. Bryson. Yeah, introducing myself, I'm Raghav. I've been with the hiver business for about eight years. Currently, I take care of our account management motion and I realized that you wanted to learn more about additional ways to use hiver and use it better. Yeah, over to you. If it's easier for you, could you maybe start at the top? Give me a quick rundown of how you're using hiver today, and then we can start discussing specific recommendations that might help.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Sounds great. Let me share my screen. Sure. Okay. So I've got 10 people on my team, so we're using three shared inboxes. The first thing I want to talk about is I have an executive assistant and I want her to… be able to see all the same emails that are coming into my Gmail inbox, and… then she can assign those out to the team as needed whether it's one of the shared inboxes we have or… generally that method. And then also she can put notes on it. I could go in there, see what she's working on. But here's the problem. Last time I tried that because I set up an admin, I set up an admin, shared inbox. And what it does is it pulled in all of you'll see over here on the left under my labels with Gmail. I've got labels here and it pulls in all of those kind of… filters set up. So it automatically filters inbox, my emails to go into these. And now it pulls those over into here. When I use my email address as the shared inbox, and then added my executive assistant. Okay? So that method didn't work.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Yeah, no. So typically, when it comes to an executive assistant and sort of having them on hiver, the shared label route is only beneficial if it's just going to be between you and the executive assistant at the end of the day, right? Because the way the shared labels work is that it's meant for smaller email sharing between like a control group. If you have a team of five and you want like emails about pricing just to be visible to two people, you don't want to send it to the inbox, that's kind of a scenario where shared labels would be useful, right? Alternatively, when it comes to an executive assistant scenario, it typically needs to be your Gmail account on the shared inbox or as the shared inbox itself, right? And then the executive assistant should be able or like should have access to all the mailboxes as a whole. Only then would she be able to move the email between the inboxes, make sure it gets to the right person, assign it and all that fancy stuff.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, yeah, I mean, from that perspective, two things I want to mention, you know, more from like a commercial angle, one is that you're already at the limit of users on the growth plan and also at the limit of mailboxes on the growth plan as well. So your current tier basically supports a 10 people total cap and three mailboxes total. And notice that you're you know, right at the limit of both of those. So if we do go down this route and explore additional ways, there would be an upgrade required to the next year, which is the pro plan. It's just, you know, giving you that clarity heading into the discussion and recommendations. Yeah.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  And I didn't want to go that route because it doubles the cost. So it's not like a 10 percent step up. It's 100 percent cost hike.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, more or less like you go from 25 to 45 effectively.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Yeah, which is just, I can't afford that 45 for a team member per month. So that's why I'm doing it. That's why I guess I'll have to just not have all my team on it because, yeah, that's just outside the budget for this.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That makes sense. And one thing I did notice is that you do have an existing discount active on your subscription. So, I mean, if you're all right with, you know, having that upgrade considered, I can pretty much work in a discounted price where it's not 39 and you know, we can, I'm sorry, not 45, but we can look at a price point that makes sense. I'm thinking a five dollar decrease but you're at 40 dollars if it makes sense, you know, just giving you an early option there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  If you want to go that route now, in case you don't want to have a dollar increase on the overall subscription, but still want to be able to achieve this. Then in that case, the shared label method is the best route. Now, you did say that the problem here is that it pulls everything into your Gmail inbox. And that was the part I was a little confused about.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Yeah. So if here's when you set up the, say the admin shared inbox with my email address as the main email on that. And then I add, and then of course, I'd add my executive assistant's email. Of course, since all the since say go to my newsletters label box. Since all these newsletters were coming directly to my email, I was told that they show up in my inbox because they're now directly as part of the admin shared inbox.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Ah, I see what you mean.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  It bypasses filtering them to these labels and it pulls them in. So I have to look through all of them which I don't want.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood. Now that is the default mechanism for the typical mailbox experience. All right. Couple of suggestions here. We can still technically make this work. It will be a couple of additional steps along the way here's. What I'm thinking, right? You've got your email address as an admin inbox, or like any inbox, basically, you create a hybrid automation rule within that inbox, saying if it's any newsletter, so you will have to like put in email addresses from addresses, domains, words on subject, things like that, and then have it all closed as one option. Or you can have these emails automatically deleted using a general Gmail filter. That way they will enter the mailbox and they'll be deleted, which means at the end of the day, they're not going to be part of the Gmail inbox or the hybrid experience as well. So those are the two options.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  I don't want them deleted. I do want to be able to access them. I just don't want to have to, I want to go to these inboxes when I want to and view these emails.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So then the only route there would be to have them automatically marked as closed, and that would require a little bit of ongoing tweaking, you know, at least for like the early stage, you can probably like look at the most common ones, put them based on domain, put that as like an auto close within your inbox. So that way within the hybrid experience, it goes to the closed section. It's not an open. It doesn't basically clog up the active queue that's the only option? Would?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  I have to add a tag.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  To those definitely auto close, add a tag so that they're marked as newsletters, you can access them when you need, but they're not in the active queue and clogging up people's view.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Do I have access to tags right now?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, you do. Yeah, definitely.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  However, do I have access to automatic tags?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, you do have access to both. So you do have access to automation workflows as we call it. And that's how, you know, pretty much add a tag to a conversation. It will be conditional. You've got up to 10 on your current plan. So we can be like if the body from address domain, different ways for which we can bring it out… and, yeah. Oh no, do the, and yeah, that one there and then select condition again and be like subject for instance or body.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Oh, yeah. Let's just test this out. So any email coming from this one, I want to… add a tag?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, okay. Cool. It's an action. You'll have to create the tag first, but that's the option there. The reason you're not seeing it is because you don't have a tag active right now?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Oh, I see that's about it. All right. So let's go. So if I added a tag to it, could it put it, where… would it store that? Would it store that over here in the labels or would it be up here in the hiver labels or something?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, it will be under like, can you click on commercial team or any of your existing shared mailboxes on the left side… scroll up a bit? Yeah. So click on tags and, you know, if you have newsletter here, they'll all pretty much rest here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Yep. So now we can create. So they,

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  won't show up down here under the Google, the Gmail labels. They'll be in my hiver tags.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Okay. So they would do the same thing at that point. So we could set it up to like auto close them. So they don't show up in my main inbox, and they don't show up in my executive admins inbox, but they still show up under here in tags.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. So we can auto close them. So they don't show up in your main inbox, correct? We can, you know, obviously add on an additional Gmail filter that says auto archive them, put the two together. It's not going to show up on your main inbox, and then auto close, it takes it out of the active queue. So, unassigned mine team, it's not going to show up anywhere. You just have to go to tags and track it when you need to.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Is there?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  On the hiver plans? Is there a way to like if I only need, every… team member has to pay the same amount right there's? Not like giving more access to some team members than others?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, we don't have like a light user or anything of that front. It's a, you know, standard fee across the entire set of users on the team.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Okay.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Let me just do some math. I just don't think I want to upgrade it at this point because that'd be like an additional 20 dollars. Yeah, that's 2,400 dollars more per year. I would have to have a very good reason. What features am I not getting access to right now?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Well, I mean, in comparison between the growth and the next year up, what you're effectively having is going to be on the lines of, or rather the features that you will have more of is going to be increased limits across the board. The next year gives you assignment limits for round Robin automations. If that's something you want to do where you can like enable a round Robin but ensure there's load balancing of sorts on that you don't have access to report exports and dashboards on your current plan that's something on the next year up. Csat is a feature that you only get on the pro plan next year up again.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  What was that csat?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Csat. So it's the satisfaction surveys. So, what it basically does is it gives you like a neat little snippet at the end of every message if you want to. And the people you're reaching out to your customers, basically can use that to give you feedback on interaction with the agents. Was it good? Were they not happy? Is there something you can do better things along those fronts?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Okay. And what about, let's see, what about, the?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Limits obviously will be higher on the next plan up?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Got it. All right. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You've got like 15 rules right now that gets bumped up to 20, your three mailbox limits gets bumped up to five mailboxes total. You won't have a cap on the total number of people and you will have, you know, access to knowledge bases.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, it's mostly increased limits outside of specific features, like you get business hours as an added advantage, and you can run reporting based on sle, although I'm not sure if you're using either of those.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  No, I'm not using the sle right now. I've tried in the past but I'm not using that one. What about just analytics? Like, how many emails a team member has sent or received?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. I mean, you already have access to those analytics. Like you do have access to reporting that tells you and gives you information about user activity, tag based activity and conversation data. You don't have custom dashboards and that's something you can build out or like, you know, overall dashboards, if you see on the top of your screen that's something you can build out for better visualization of the data that's something on the next plan.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Now, if you want to see what that's like, I can quickly swap and show you.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Yeah, I do. And before we jump over there though, let me just see. Is there a way to get, is… there a way, to pull data out of this into a Google sheet on, usage… by team member?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. Definitely. So, custom reports is something you can do, you can do exports one at a time. So, when you want to like take it out to a Google sheet or something, click on exports instead, this one. And that would give you the standard. Now, the scheduled one basically generates the CSV and delivers it to your scheduled time. This one, you have access to right now, the scheduled and automatically receiving that report that gets unlocked on the next year, right? So click on filter by before you do that, and you'll have more options, right? Which.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Were, you know, who's got it? What type of emails, things like that? And then if you minimize this, click on choose columns that's your entire data set at the bottom. Yeah. So that's the entire set of data that you receive, okay, within the export, basically the columns.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  And if I wanted this to happen.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  The automatic, the scheduled export just means they would email me the data once a day or whatever I set the schedule to be.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Basically, yes, you're going to get this exported CSV file based on your frequency every Monday, nine am every week, every month, every day, your choice on the preference there?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Is there any way to have the data like through an API or through zapier, pull the accounts automatically into a Google sheet?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I mean, we do have an S3 bucket route you can take with the scheduled export that puts the data, pushes the CSV file and the data into an Amazon S3 bucket. People usually use that when they're tying it to like a looker studio dashboard or they're doing like Google apps scripts or something in the background. And that way they get this report automatically there. So like the export automatically goes there. So.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  That's going to take a little more development skill to do that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I mean, I can probably check with my team and see if we have bandwidth to be able to help you achieve that as well.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Okay. Yeah, I'd be interested in doing that. If, if, yeah, you could set that up and I'd love to just have somebody quickly set it up so that I can just dump that data into a Google sheet automatically somehow?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood. And what would you like to happen as an outcome of dumping that data onto the Google sheet? Like I'm just trying to realize what outcome you're going for?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Yeah. What I'm going for is I would put it into, I would dump it into a scorecard… that shows how many emails sent per… user. So I could see how many emails sent or received or whatever data I wanted. I would pull from that data set into a weekly scorecard?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For my.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  team?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, I see what you're going for. Yeah, think of.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  It like for instance, here's, I've got them for calls and sales and I just pivot table by day and so it dumps, it compiles it all by day. And then I can just do a lookup by employee and it pulls those counts. So I'd like to get the counts automatically without me having to worry about it every day into my scorecard.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. I'm sure we can work something out. Just give me one quick minute. I'm just checking something real quick before I give you a call.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Take your time.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. From what I'm seeing that is possible, you know, using like to your point like you said, you know, Google sheets API connected with an S3 and, or alternatively using zapier, getting that going as well. Let me do one thing on this front, you know, but like getting the dump and having that show up on Google sheets. Let me unpack this with my team first. Brian, let me see what the, what that scope of it looks like and see if we can, we'd be able to accommodate it, as a one time request… open to upgrading. Yeah.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Yeah. Let's look at that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, for sure. Let me check that out and I'll be sure to circle back to you after veterans day holiday. You know, there's like a bunch of pto coming up for the team. So, I think by the latest by Thursday next week, you can expect a reply from me on what that would look like. And, you know, if it makes sense, we can continue that discussion on that front.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Okay. Sounds good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. But yeah, coming back to, the other bits of hiver, any other pieces of hiver that you're curious about? Wondering if, you know, the workflows are right? Because I did notice you don't have a lot of automations to begin with. So I was just curious, you know, is that something that you haven't had the chance to check out? Or is it just because you just want the team to? Yeah.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Show me. I mean, I love automation and I want to maximize automation. So… yeah, especially on my commercial team, I guess I just don't know exactly how it would work.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Fair enough. How about I give you a different question instead? And when it comes to the commercial team, are there three things you'd like to automate just out of the gate that would make life easier for everybody or at least for you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  guess I don't know that yet. I'll have to get with that team and say, because I know they get a ton of emails from various… companies that we work with such as late payments on your clients. So yeah, if we could automate those to go to the right team member or maybe even auto close them, I guess I'll have to get with them and get a list of what we want to see happen before I can answer that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. No, I agree there. Now, what I can do is just to show you a quick overview, right? Let me just swap my screen instead. I can just give you like a couple of suggestions that I think might make sense, you know, barring AI and taking that out of the equation. One thing that we use internally pretty heavily is, you know, and the pro plan unlocks business hours as well for you, where basically you're like commercial team email is received outside of business hours, send a specific reply that's custom made for these out of office conversations and requests and send it out to them using a workflow like this that says, hey, when email is received, a reply is received. And if the time is outside business hours, then you can have hiver send a very specific reply saying thanks for reaching us. We're not around blah, blah, blah, we'll get back to you at a certain time, right? It's one scenario, second scenario was to your point, there's a lot of payment reminders, payment follow ups and the team needs to stay on top of it. Automations can help you unlock automatic reminders and follow ups going out to the customer directly or sending a reminder to your team. So you can be like, hey, if there's sorry about that. My sandbox is going haywire. Basically, what you're seeing is you're working on an external reply. And if the, again, this is where tags would be your primary prerogative. And you can be like, if the tag is any of refund, for example, right? So this will be two automations. First we'll establish a way to have the refund added as a tag. Once that's done, we'll be like, hey, if hiver, I'm tracking external replies and I'm tracking it for the refund tag and for the refund tag. If there's no reply, so we can be like time passed since is 24 hours business hours. So if there's no reply received on an email in say three days, then you want hiver to escalate it, reassign it to a different person, send a notification to like the owner and the team lead, for example, these are some of the usual commercial or sales team related automations that I've worked quite usefully. So this way the system does the follow up with the customer. The system reminds your team member and they can maybe stay on top of things to like the next follow up or how to tweak it from there. Okay. Right. That's.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  so, yeah, now.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's one way of thinking about it. Additionally, you can also do, you know, things like if there's a certain field, like if you want to use a date based custom field, that could be your timeline where you like refund requests or contract execution to be executed on 20 fifth of November and five days before that, you want to drop a reminder to the customer saying, hey, it's 28. You've only got five more days. Do you want to like, you know, are you good to go ahead? Do you want to let us change anything? Things like that? It's also another scenario where automations can help. So looking beyond, yeah, sorry, Bryson, go ahead.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Give me one second you want to check something.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  What about we get an email from a vendor from a company saying, hey, your client is past due on this payment and then they send another one, say three days later, the same thing, and another one three days later. Is there any way for these automations to catch that? Hey, we've already received this late payment notice regarding this. The subject line is the same as the one we received three days ago.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. So the automation can be based on the subject line. The only thing I'm thinking out loud here with you is if the vendor changes like the client changes, but the subject is just going to say late payment noticed, right? Right? That dynamic part of it. I don't think workflow builders can handle that.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Got it. So I would have to make sure that the subject line is unique and if it is unique… between customers. But if it's a duplication from three days ago and three days before that, then there might be a way to auto close or filter those out.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, I want to say, yes. Again, this, the only additional part that I want to give you your way is that automation builders as a whole are not exactly dynamic in that sense of it. So once you set a rule, it's definitely going to follow that rule and get the job done. Be it auto close or anything. It's just that you'll have to be mindful or at least in the first few weeks and months, make sure you vet it out and ensure there's nothing that actually is meant to work on that falls through the cracks.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  I hear you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's the trade off you'll be looking at. But yeah, definitely to answer your question, totally late payment notice that's the common theme, get everything in there, close, it, put it out, get it done. That's something that you can do?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Got it. Okay. That's good enough. I'll play around with that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Bryson. And additionally, what I'll do is like I mentioned, I'll chat with the team on the whole Google sheets, auto export to flow into a sheet kind of perspective. I'll see if a zapier can accomplish that or if our team can help you with scripting assistance just as a one time effort to get that going for you. Additionally, what I'll also do is I'll send over documentation on the entire set of automations, what you have access to today and the advanced triggers you'll unlock with the pro plan.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So that way between the two, I'm guessing you can do some reading, see if that helps. And if you'd like we can schedule a follow up call for sometime next week or the week after, we can talk a little bit about the automations and we can chat about the apps script piece as well if I have clarity on that by then.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Yeah, sounds great. Let's go for two weeks. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sorry, Bryson. All right. Do you have a time in mind? I just wanted to close out my calendar?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Yeah. Let's do. How about Wednesday, the nineteenth, three PM Mountain Time? Okay? Just give me one minute, Mountain Time is.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Chicago, I want to say three P. M Mountain Time. I'm sorry, I'm usually on eastern and.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  pacific. Oh, that's fine. No.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Three P. M mountain. Actually, I just got the.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Time three 30.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, I'm good to go nineteenth, three P. M Mountain Time. I'll send you an invite for 30 minutes, okay?

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Sounds good. Thank you very much. We'll talk to you then.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  My pleasure. Bryson, hope you have a good day.

Bryson Karren (bryson@bkarrenagency.com):
  Take care, you too. Thanks. Bye now.
