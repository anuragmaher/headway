Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Chris. How are you?

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Hi, Yukta. I'm good. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you. Thanks.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Very much for making time here.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. My pleasure. So, shall we get started or expecting more people to join in as well?

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Just you and me.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Then, Chris, I know you booked a demo with us. So, thank you for doing that. I'll be taking you.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  In Yukta, can you hear me?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And accordingly, I'll be in a position to give you a brief demonstration of the platform.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  That sounds great. You broke up for just a minute, but I think I got the important parts. No, you're good might have been on my end if it's okay with you.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Let me take just two minutes to give you a little context on what we're trying to do here. Hopefully, that lets you focus the demo a little bit.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Sounds great.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Okay. So I run a small business. We're a research company. We sell a subscription based research product. The details aren't super important, but we're publishing monthly research. We also publish dashboards and different data feeds, and we have about 150 clients. Most of those clients are just very happy with what we produce and we, very, rarely hear from them. But over the course of a week, we'll receive, I don't know five, maybe 10 questions from our clients. Yukta, can you hear me? Okay? Looks like you broke up again?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I can hear you, but I think my video is frozen.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  That's fine here. I'll turn off video too. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Now, it's better. I don't know, I think.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Okay. So we're dealing with a very small volume of inbound emails. Let's call it 10 a week. So two a day. And sometimes those questions are extremely simplistic like, hey, my login isn't working? Can you reset my password? And other times, they're more nuanced and they really require us to spend some time and go back to our clients with a thoughtful answer. Today. I manage all those inbounds and I'm not very good at it. I'm just distracted. I'm working on other things. It's not a priority. We have a new hire that's starting in January. Part of her job will be managing all of the inbound questions we get from clients. Our plan is to direct all those questions to a dedicated inbox contact at jouncemedia com. She'll monitor that. And what I want to do is have essentially a ticketing system so that we can have very good tracking of response times and which questions, you know, which emails are not yet answered. Ideally have like a system for assigning different emails to different people on our team and kind of like escalating to the right person. Like, hey, it's been three days. You still haven't gotten back to this email. So I just want to have some basic structure for having a, very organized system for handling client email questions that's what we're trying to solve.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. Yeah, makes sense. And thanks for sharing that, Chris. So currently, you said that this whole thing is just managed by you alone, and then you'll have a new resource who's going to start from January? And then you'll sort of be able to, you know, handle it through her and manage these emails, right? So eventually, like how many people would you want to, you know, have in this team? Who's going to be working on this inbox and handling these?

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  In the next year, it'll be three people?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Cool. I think. Yeah. And you're currently hosted on Google workspace, that is right? Correct?

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  That's correct? Okay. Perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, I mean having something like a simple ticketing solution will definitely help you having this more streamlined where nothing is getting missed. You have certain templates also. So that for the questions that are coming in, which are more, you know, complicated or detailed at least as a new resource that you will have, they could have certain templates to go through as well. And yeah, you would be able to then easily bifurcate the work and see what's happening, how we are handling these emails on a day to day basis? Should I just share my screen and show you that would?

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Be great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Perfect. Yeah, that would be great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let me just do that. So, can you see my screen?

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  I can, and just to be sure, I assume this is fine, but I'm going to take a couple of screenshots as we go, just so I stay organized. Is that okay with you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally fine.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Great. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So just to give you a quick introduction, Chris hiver works on Gmail. So it integrates with your Gmail itself so that you don't have to use a separate platform to handle this inbox. So here as you can see, I'm logged into my Gmail account, and I have hiver embedded here. What we will do is we will create a shared inbox with the same email address that you mentioned contact at the rate when you're receiving all these inquiries. And we would add the relevant people onto that inbox so that you would be part of it and your team member would be part of it. So that whoever needs to work on this inbox can access that while they are logged into their Gmail account, so that they can handle their personal inbox at the same time, can manage the support inbox as well. Now, from here, you would be able to then see clearly as to know what are the emails which are still unassigned that have not been picked by anyone. From there. There would be an option wherein a person can assign those emails to themselves, and those will go into their mind section, wherein they know that these are the ones that I am responsible for and for you probably as a supervisor or as a manager, you could. Or if you have multiple people, of course, you could only see your own emails in the mind section. But to have an understanding of what's really happening across the team, you would have that visibility. And it's also for everyone to maintain that transparency of at all times. We know what we are dealing with. So that if someone needs to jump in, let's say this email is currently assigned to me. And if you would want to leave a note for me or anything or if you would want to get an update since it's been sitting for like four days still open and we have not actioned on it, we can do it right within here as well without having to mark each other in CC or have a separate conversation in regards to this one. So we can actually mention each other and have those conversation flowing. And as in when we require help, we can always mention each other here itself. And this remains internal. So this is something that we could do. And then of course, as you would have different kinds of queries coming into this inbox, you could definitely use tags as well which will help you sort of, you know, categorize these emails and give these tags so that it's easier for your reference. Whenever you want to just look at one category. You could go into that topic and just fetch all emails related to that. So, this would be the assignment in tags. Any questions so far? Do you think this aligns with what you just were talking about?

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  It definitely does. Can you go back to that view that was showing all the different tags? Yep just for your context, I've got a call coming up with the sort of like the key people on my team right after this and I just, that was a useful screenshot which I've now got. Okay. Great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Great. Perfect. So yeah, I think this would be from the assignment and you know, categorizing emails apart from it, you could when you are actually working on an email, like I mentioned, email templates is something that could be used. Like so far, you have been only responding to these emails from the ones that you think that, you know, are more repetitive. You could create a repository out of it for future resources to be able to use when they are working on these. I think that would be a great idea. While they're working, they just have to, you know, put the placeholders and it's good to go. They don't really have to spend a lot of time, you know, always response. Yeah. So this is something that could be done. And once I'm done here, I would just mark it as closed and this will get removed from here and you would be able to see under all views, all the closed emails that we have already worked on. So this is where you can see all of these. And if you have any response coming on to either closed or pending, these will pop back into your mind section so that you don't really have to keep an eye on these and just focus on what's here as your open emails at all times. So this would be the basic workflow as to, you know, how, what you mentioned, and as you start growing this team as well. And of course, from the analytics perspective, as you mentioned, you would be able to see different metrics, different reports in terms of, you know, the, how the traffic looks like in this inbox, right? And how, what's the average response time for us in which we are responding to these emails individually for each person. Also, you can see and for tags as well. So these would be the reports that you could definitely make use of as you are working on these.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  This is great. I… think I'm going to have more questions over time but I think this is plenty to make me feel like this is going to solve our needs. I've got two questions for you. Let me write them down. So the second one doesn't fall out of my head. Just bear with me one second.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Okay. I think this is going to work great for us. I want to make sure we are, you know, in a good spot in the event that we launch this and realize like, oh, actually, no, this doesn't work. If we cancel our hiver subscription, what happens at that stage? Like does everything, is everything still retained in that dedicated Gmail inbox, and just this workflow all goes away.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that is correct. So anyway, you know, hiver is so syncing that inbox and giving you a view here. So your emails are going to remain as it is in your contact. Inbox. Hiver anyway, does not store any of these emails. It only restricts it to the message id of these emails and these labels that you see, the gray ones. This is what they use in order to configure your inbox and give you this view here. So of course, you will lose everything within hiver in terms of the setup workflows, tags and all of that. But the rest of the stuff you'll just go back to how things are today without hiver.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Okay. And then my other question is during the setup process, I assume you've got great documentation on the website, but are there also people who are available to us to sort of like answer questions and help us configure things the right way?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think see as for the setup, I can help you with that. So we have a trial as well for seven days. So I would want you to set it up and see how it's working. But once your trial is done, once you've decided to move ahead with hiver, implement it for everyone, you would always have the support team. Of course, I'll be available as well. But the support is available like instantly. So you can always connect with any of our agents and they would be right there. And then this is great. Yeah. Okay.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  So pricing I saw on your website, it looks like it's on a per user basis. Is that right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, it is. So minimum, we have two users to start with. So yeah, you could either go annually or monthly accordingly. The pricing will be, yeah.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Okay. And I guess, I mean, I feel super clear on this. Maybe you can just give me some guidance on based on what we just talked about, you know, is the growth plan going to do the job for us? Do we need to move moving to pro or elite?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, I think growth will suffice as you start with pro. Just have additional features of csat service, setting up the business hours, having a chatbot, but I think based on where we are right now, I think growth is a good starter for you. And if you feel the need, then you can later upgrade.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  And what is just so I can think forward csat, what does that mean?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Csat is basically customer survey that you often put at the end of the email, right?

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right. So that is something that you could have here apart from it. I think AI is something that would come as an add on in case you're interested. So with AI, you would just get additional things like these faces that you see the emoji here. It does like the sentiment analysis on each of your email on its own so that, you know, how, what the sentiment is, and then you would have AI summarizer, you could have auto tagging through AI, which will tag your emails automatically and the ask AI here wherein you could ask anything and get a help in drafting your responses. Do you think these things could be useful at this point or?

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  I think what you said is correct, which is that we should start with that basic plan. Yeah. And then over time, you know, maybe we upgrade, but I don't think we'll need it on day one.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's why, you know, free. I'm not recommending because of course, it just, it doesn't have anything like even tags and templates. So I think this would really work, but I think this is a good starting point for you.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  All right, great. So, I think I'll talk with the team. I think we'll want to do that seven day trial, get it all set up. And, but this feels super straightforward. Is there anything else you think I need to be thinking about?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Not really. I think the setup is also like it'll barely take like 10, 15 minutes for us to do that and then you can start using it. But my question is like since you'll have a new hire in January, like are you looking to implement this right now or wait?

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  We are, we are because she is already a part time contractor for us and so I'd like to start now, make it clear to her that, you know, her responsibilities will not include this email service, but I'd like her to be a part of like configuring it with us. And then by January, I want to have this sort of like fully organized and ready for her to take over.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that is fine. If you want. I can help you start the trial right now itself if you have time like or we can, you know.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  I think I'd rather just talk with the guys on.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  I've got a call in like an hour. So let me talk with them, okay? And then I'll come back to you. Can I just email you directly? Is that the best way to reach out?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'll anyway, be sharing the collaterals. I'll also share the beginner's guide sort of. So if you want to set it up yourself, you can explore that as well, and then we can connect back, take your questions, queries like anywhere you prefer.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  Okay… great. I think we're I think we're set. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much. I'll be back to you probably later today.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. Chris. I look forward to.

Chris Kane (chris@jouncemedia.com):
  It. Nice to meet you. Thanks.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Likewise. Thank you. Bye, bye bye.
