Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I love it. Hey, Matthew. Nice to meet you.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  You too.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I'm Alex.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Can you hear me?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yes, I can. Can you hear.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  me? Yep, I can yep.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Well, I appreciate you reaching out to learn a little bit more about hiver. I'm Alex, one of the account executives over here. I've been in the help desk CX world for the last 10 years. So pretty fluent in the softwares and typical, you know, reasons why people are kind of looking for a solution. But yeah, just, and, you know, today can guide you through the product, talk about kind of why hiver, why now and anything else, but would love to hear a little bit more about yourself and kind of what brought you to us today.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Yeah. So my end, the big thing is that I work for an it company, it support company that works with schools. And yes… just sort of managing those tickets and managing those emails obviously get a bit messy working through different help desks and… forwarding emails through things. And hiver seems to be able to clear that up a little bit, which will make things easier on our end. But I was put onto this through, my boss wanting to look through different software solutions and… that's where hiver came into it.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Nice. And did I see that you all use Gmail for email? Yes?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Yeah, yeah, mainly Gmail and through Google. Great.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. We also have an outlook product, but they're two separate… products and if needed, we could bring your Gmail account or the Gmail emails into the outlook standalone platform. Yeah, I think I saw that you said that you have like four to five people that might be using a system like this, was that correct?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  I think that's the initial, what my employer initially wants to do is four to five people possibly scanning up further later.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And how many, you know, I guess how many shared mailboxes are being managed or shared domains, whether it's you know, a support at or an independent Google that you're logging into or a Google group, like kind of what does that look like?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  There's one support that is mainly managed by my employer, whether that would change with taking on hiver or not. I'm uncertain.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Cool. So, a single shared inbox, yes, should be… we have a great solution for you and it's really easy. Okay. And are there… like, you know, you're serving schools? Are there a number of school districts or is it all kind of, is everyone treated kind of the same regardless to which like domain they're writing in from?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  It's all treated the same. So, yeah, it's yeah, just to describe it, they're all treated the same.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And then internally, do you have multiple people replying to these emails or is this more about creating better visibility in terms of like what needs to get done?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  I'd have to check what my boss wants me to do, but I believe the major thing is visibility and what needs to be done, and the ticketing process is a big thing within this company.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Great. Well, let me show you what we're working on and you know, feel free to interrupt me and we can kind of go through like solutioning and everything else in real time sweet as. So where we are, we're in the Google inbox and we have the hiver Chrome extension up here. So hiver works within Chrome. We are a Google cloud partner. Over 3,000 businesses use hiver with tens of thousands of end users. So what this looks like? So the first five segments, normal Gmail. And then everything in yellow is hiver related. So what that means is down here in support where we're going to be spending most of our time. This would be the main shared inbox that, you know, the four or five users would all be have access to. Yeah… all emails that go to, you know, support at or info at would come land in this inbox. We have ways of doing auto assignment of the emails if needed. But typically with smaller teams that's not like a main interest, but we could do round Robin, skill based or workload based assignments. Yeah. And before I even click on an email, you're seeing, you know, we have this gray box which turns red. It's a SLA. So it's like essentially setting a timer on every email to make sure things don't slip through the crack and everyone's getting the support that they expect. We have sentiment analysis followed by tagging. So essentially we're trying to bifurcate the conversation. So, you know, which ones are more important and have more clarity before you take on work. Yeah. So now we have Jake… on the right hand rail is kind of how the, is what we're doing to augment Gmail into more of a ticketing platform? So we'll have who's it assigned to, you know, if you're working on it, you could just assign it to yourself… the status open pending and closed. We're going to do custom statuses and kind of the more advanced plans. But usually that's enough. And that's enough because we also have custom drop down fields. So it's like what are the various stages that we're working on? So really what we're trying to do is give you as much information about Jake as we kick off. So we'll have like the contact card with Jake and all of his, the emails that he's written in about that you could go click out to. And then if there are multiple like districts or domains that you're supporting. We also could highlight like the kind of more of like a B to B play of here, all the other conversations happening from Phoenix digital in this case… and then finally we have over 100 connected apps, whether it's like Hubspot, Salesforce, quickbooks, Netsuite to… showcase information. And then do you use like Jira, or Trello or another tool internally?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  No, I don't believe we do.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Great. Well, I'll skip that, but we can create objects and other tools too.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Yeah, I presume that there's plenty of support guides and available on through hiver, if I wanted to set that up later.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Tons of support guides and something that's going to really set us apart versus everyone else 24 seven, 365 technical chat support and we'll hop on a call with you as needed yep.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  So, just double checking that.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's amazing. Cool. So, you know, Jake's written into us. We've kind of filled out. We've collected some more information, seen any notes that my team members have left. I'm going to reply to Jake. I have a full template library.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And then, you know, when I click send, you know, sending and close send and closing on a sign, send and pending just depending on what we're working on. Yeah, and let's say, you know, a conversation has come in and you're like, hey, I think this is the right answer, but I want to confirm with my supervisor. We can share this as a draft. So, you know, showing that you're doing work against it. I could come in here then at mention the supervisor… or I could simply just reassign it to the supervisor. So really… trying to make collaboration effortless and give full visibility into the conversations. Great. So, you know, we have our, you know, traditional, you know, frontline people managing the unassigned tickets. Maybe I've assigned a couple to myself that I'm just personally working through. And the ones that I'm personally working through, let's say, matt, you want to go on vacation. So now your boss comes and he's like, okay, let me pick up matt's work while he's gone. So we have the team section. And now I can come pop in and see all the open conversations by team member. In this case, Yukta has 15 conversations that are open and look just violate the red is violating slas. So here, I can come in either bulk action, reassign them or just work on them one at a time. Okay? Yep. So it does, yeah. So that is the baseline of what we do. There are a lot of additional bells and whistles of what we call an AI co pilot, which could come, you know, if it's a long conversation quickly summarize or you could ask it to start writing your emails for you. We have an internal knowledge base that could also be externally facing. That internal knowledge base is used as kind of like a simple rag system for these email drafting. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And yeah, then we have a full suite of analytics as well as a backend admin system with automations, the ability to set up these custom fields slas, and kind of what ties it all together. So, I'll pause here. Is this kind of in the realm of what you're thinking about?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  This is, yeah, it's definitely in the realm of what we're looking for. Yeah, this is the main thing was just the email and ticketing making it all through Gmail was the ideal solution that we wanted. So this is looking pretty promising. Great. Yep.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Do you care about analytics or?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Me personally? Yeah, I don't know if my employer might do. So. Just you can walk me through it if you have the time. Cool.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  What your employer might be measuring you on?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Good to know. Yeah. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  We have two segments, workload and performance. Yeah. So we have a date range. You can create your custom date. I just do last night. Yeah. So workload is how many open conversations are there in this period, new or net new ones and then resolved or, you know, marked closed during the period and are still closed. And then we're measuring that over like classic performance metrics of how long does it take us to reply? The first time assign the workout and then full resolution time on conversations. Yeah. And then where it gets a little big brothery is on the user segment. So again, this is just in the shared inbox, not in your personal email, but we can drill down and look at every user's workload. And then everything here is also drillable. Yeah. So you can get to the underlying, you know, emails… and then I… don't think you need this in your plan yet. But we also have like AI quality assurance tools to like say, are your, is your team doing a good nice job emailing back out to customers and things of that nature? Yeah. And then from setup it's actually it's really easy to configure and set everything up even though I know it's your first time looking at it like should I believe the sales Guy. So what you're going to do is create a shared inbox. And when you download the tool, it's going to set this up with you. So you will you're going to log in with your personal Gmail through the company. And then you'll create the shared inbox with the shared Google group, or if it's a standalone domain… then from there, we'll add our users and then add the users to this inbox. And I think the two things that are interesting here is one automations. So two simple automations I like to talk about are one sentiment where if the AI sentiment's updated, so there's like a trigger event, it's if this, then that logic and the sentiment is negative or very negative, then, we could send an automatic email to the user and assign it to like a manager and then add an escalation tag… pretty straightforward. We could also do this based on keywords. So a new conversation comes in contains the following keywords and subject or body, add urgent tag and assign to someone. This is also really these automations are really useful for if you have a lot of like notifications coming into the shared inbox that don't actually require action, we can automatically close those out. And, yeah, and then if needed, we have slas, so do you all. Do you think this would be relevant?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Like… could do, could be okay, just talk me through it anyway? Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Essentially, there's two pieces to the SLA, there's the overdue and, or, sorry, yeah, there's overdue where… the sense is like, okay, you have everything has like two slas, it's the first response time that's due in a certain amount, and then total resolution time that the ticket's open. And then we just added a due soon to try to provide some pre warning as needed. Yeah. And that's kind of the quick run through like we have some additional AI features with AI tagging which can help with triage, Our internal knowledge base. You can set this up. So, you know, all of your procedures are outlined in terms of like how your team operates if you guys are onboarding a lot of new people here and there.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And, yeah, the other interesting thing is the AI co pilot where this is what's helping us write the email.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  And that AI is a hiver AI?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's a hiver rag system that is currently hooked up to chatgbt. Okay?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Yeah. It's.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  more of a framework because we don't know what the best gpt will be in the future for this. Yeah. But the most interesting thing I think is you can just upload documents here that the AI is using to generate these emails. Yeah. So that's kind of my quick run through. Usually, the next question is how much does this?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Cost? Yeah, that's a good question. And actually, this is all in usd. I presume.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yes, this is in usd. Yeah. Okay. How's the New Zealand dollar?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Well, it's probably about two to one. Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I've never been that far. I mean, I live in New York, yeah, but we offer annual and month to month commitments… based on everything you've told me. I think that you could definitely start with the growth plan. So, for five users on an annual that's 125 a, month to month is 175 dollars for five users, no commitment. And you still get the 24 seven support. We're going to help set you up through that, make sure that everyone has everything that they need… what would push you to the next plan is needing slas, having more than 10 total users or needing more than two shared inboxes. Yeah. So, but I, you know, I'm incentivized to get you to pro, but from… what you told me.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Yeah, I'll.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  talk.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  To my employee anyway, if she really wants slas, I can obviously relay that to her, but we shall see. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And you can upgrade at any time. So we… also offer, a free trial. So, if you just sign up on our website, you're going to see the start free trial button. Yeah, that's where you're going to log in with your personal Gmail and then sync up to the shared email address… the free trial seven days, but I can extend it a bit longer. So, you guys get like a full two weeks of usage if you wanted to start kind of an hour sooner than later, and.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Yeah, that probably, I mean, I would conversation with her after this, but sounds cause we're in a low period where it's probably a good time to take on board new organization, new software like this for a trial. So we'll see. So probably, if we do start, probably would be very soon… great. Well, I'll.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  send over that information and follow up. Is there anything else that you were hoping to see or want to talk through?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  I don't think so. I think that covers all the key points. And probably most of the stuff would be better just poking around myself through the trial, seeing what I can find. Okay?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  During the trial, you also have access to our support. Yeah, please use them like we're here to help… that's the growth plan. You're getting a lot of value for the dollar and, you know, for teams of your size, I, we certainly provide the best support compared to kind of the marketplace, what, you know, what's out there right now. So, there's my extra sales pitch for you?

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  It's working, it's working… great. Well, sweet. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Would it make sense to set up a, you know, a check in like a week from now just to see how things are going.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  I will probably, I can contact you by that email, correct? You sent through. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And I'll send you another email, so it's top of the inbox. Okay? Yep.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  So, it is. Yeah, I'll probably contact you, but if you want to check up in case I haven't reached out, be a good call.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Cool. Yeah, we, this… is right up our wheelhouse. So look forward to potentially working with you. And if your team wants to do move forward with the trial, you can sign up yourself, but shoot me a note so I can extend it a little for, out on my side.

Matthew Sebire (matthew@schooledupit.co.nz):
  Yep, I will do. Cool. Thank you very much. Great to meet you. Yeah, that's it you too. Yeah, yeah.
