Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, mcbully. Can you hear me?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Hey, Raghav. I can hear you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  How you doing?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Good, man. How you doing?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I am pretty good. I'm just dealing with a bit of cough. So I'm going to be video off apart from that, ready to go for Friday evening without settling in for the rest of my day.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. You mentioned evening. Are you like out of the country?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm working out of India. It's about one a M in the morning. So, Friday evening.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Well, I hope, I think, I'm sure you're kind of used to it. Yeah, we have team members who, you know, internationally, so.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, I mean, I've been doing this for about a decade now. So, at this point, this is my Friday evening and I'm so used to it. It's unnatural.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Okay. Nice. So, well, I appreciate you hopping on this call… essentially, you know, we've been using hiver for, I don't know, maybe like over a year now. I think, let me double check, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You started on June 24?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  June 24, so or like this year? Oh, no, 2024 24.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no. June four, 2024.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  24. Okay. So over a year now then, yeah. And you guys just suddenly just changed the pricing and I did not even notice it. Let me double check. Let me pull it up.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Just so I can actually see the numbers?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, we actually went through a bit of a transition on the plan we had that we were rolling it out in phases for our customer base. And I'm sure we've sent out at least a couple of email heads up about it heading into the transition. We had different batches throughout Q3 heading into this year. So we had a pricing change on the backs of feature functionality that we've launched and as a result, I think your account was migrated to the growth tier because the light plan that you were previously on is no longer supported on hiver.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  So it's a really big jump, Raghav. And the truth of the matter is we don't really use hiver that much. You know, it could potentially change especially because… so actually let me ask you this since this is kind of a, I think this sounds like this is a sales conversation. Well, one is I do, I really was not aware of it, Raghav. And so you could even see in our account, it's like I'm… looking at this, we were at 14 dollars became 51 became 76 and then just completely jumped to like 186. And so one is, I would like to see what we can do to just downgrade this and request for a refund because I was not aware of this and I did not say yes to it. The second thing though is this is separate from this. We don't necessarily use hiver so much on our customer success side, which is how we're using it right now. However, I have thought about it where we're… looking into a process for our sales team to start using their Gmail to do like cold outreach and sales conversations. Because we use a CRM right now, we use go high level. And what we're noticing is Deliverability issues. And so that could be a potential there. I'm trying to see if you guys have used hiver for sales processes instead of like right now, I know it's kind of a ticketing system. And so those are two separate conversations. So why don't, we start with the refund and downgrading my account first?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, for sure. So one thing about the whole pricing change, right? I just pulled up the entire contact information and all the communication that would have gone out or at least had gone out. So what's happened in your account is a, we no longer offer the light plan in itself but with that said the new plan that you're on the growth plan which replace the light actually has an annual plan or an annual version of it which is retailing for more or less the same. It's about you were on a 24 dollar per user per month before. And the growth annual is at 25 usd per person per month, right?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  So, yeah, look, I'm just going to be straight up with you man. Like I don't want the annual, I don't want the annual, like to be honest, we really only use one person here. Like if that's the case, then I'm just going to cancel this account. I'm just going to cancel this account completely because again, we literally do not use it except for one user. And so… like what are the options there? Like what is the, bare minimum? And I don't know if you even have like a free plan that's just like doesn't have all the bells and whistles?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. That's that's actually a good point that's what I was going to as well. We do have a free plan that you can definitely downgrade to and, you know, in terms of like usage and stuff like that, you can have pretty much as many users as you want for one inbox, total, right? So it's two prong, right? And the reason you're billing is at about 175 as it is today as opposed to 72 that it was as of may when we last built is primarily because you're on two things, right? You're on a tiered subscription plan, and that's the new pricing model. And the second one is the light plan which got sunset and you're on monthly. So you got bumped up to growth monthly, which is 35 per user per month. So being as transparent as you are with me, we do have a light plan. I mean, we do have a free plan that you can downgrade to. It allows you one email inbox, one tag and one email template. Total right? No automation rules. None of the extra bells and whistles, but just gets the bare bones version of hiver done.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  OK. Because you're basically saying that literally outside of the free plan, this is the cheapest plan that you guys have. I'm understanding 100?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Percent, yes. And.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  And I understand. And I understand like, you know, they're trying to maximize revenue. So, I get that as a business owner, but it sounds like you guys are essentially forcing people to pay for five users even if I'm only going to use one, is that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Correct. Oh, no. So the way the buckets work is going to be to use one user bare minimum, and then it's going to be two to three users. So effectively, the first three, you can pretty much look at it as a per user thing. From three, it goes to five as the next bucket and then five onwards, it's going to be buckets of five. So, yeah.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  So that's where I'm confused though because why am I getting charged for five if I only have three users?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's a good question. So let me just quickly double check that and see if you had five users at a certain point of time or anything on that front. Yeah… cool. So I've pulled it up. So the bucketing model in itself is one to two. I'm sorry, one to two is the first bucket. So one and two people that's the two user bucket minimum. And then you go from two to five, five to 10, 10 to 15, 15 to 20 and so on and so forth. Excuse me.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  So, so that's what you're so basically, because.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  you have three active people on hiver, you're in three to five user bucket, and that's why you're at the five user license count.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  So, so even though there's three users I'm forced to pay for five, is that correct?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, you are looking at like a five user billing total.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  So let me see here. Let's just go ahead. I'm just going to downgrade let's see. I'm just going to remove. So, so what's the best thing to do here? Yeah. So do you want me to just like start kicking out, start kicking out users. And then, you know, I don't know where the inbox is, if you could help me?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Kind of remove the inbox. OK, I see it here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So you've got two inboxes total. You've got three people that's why you're in the three to five user bucket, you remove one user, and that will put you in the two user bucket, which is one and two people total. That will bring you down to 70 per person per month. I'm sorry, 70 for the subscription per month, 35 times to 70. You can stay on the monthly plan that is aligned and you don't have to change anything. And that way you can continue with two mailboxes. You don't need to remove anything. All you need to do is reduce one user and you're on the two user bucket.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  And then, so let's actually here, let me just share my.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Screen, yes, I was just going to ask you there we go.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  So, let me see essentially.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You can keep the two mailboxes. You can even add one more because your current plan supports up to three. The reason you're on the five people license count is because you've got three people and the bucket is three to five. You drop one user from here and you're going to be in the two user bucket, which means two people 35 per person on a monthly, 70 dollars on the current plan.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  So, let me just because let me just talk to.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And, you know, just curious Billy, what's the apprehension in terms of switching to annual? Is it just that upfront billing cost on dollar value in itself?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Well, one is upfront dollar cost, but again, we're not really like using this like honestly, like I could downgrade to like the free plan and we wouldn't be affected. You know, that makes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  sense.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Because, so just to give you context the way we move from like a ticketing thing to like a direct slack support for most of our clients. And that's why, you know, this is kind of like less important for us if that makes sense.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that makes total sense.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  But like I told you potentially that's a separate conversation on the sales side, that could be something that I'm kind of foreseeing that like, oh, this might be useful. But for this, so let's just say I just remove her for now. So I'm just going to delete it. Delete her… and delete her.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. And so on renewal, which is one second. Let me pull that up. So on renewal, which is December fourth. Wait, am I looking at your account? Yeah, renewal, December fourth, you will be charged for two users. I'll work with my team, reverse the charge that we did for 186 in November, have the excess refunded. So you just charge for two people in November, December onwards. It will be automatically for two people. So about 70 dollars.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  So, now to go down to the free plan though, what would need to happen?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Can you go to shared inboxes?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Shared inbox.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. You've got two here. You've got to reduce it to one just.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Delete this, I'm going to delete this right now?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. And can you do me one more favor? Can you go to click on Gmail on the top left? While that's deletion is happening, click on gvs support on the left side?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Gvs support?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And then tags at the bottom, right? Yeah. Okay. You've got to drop this down to just one.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Just drop it to one. Okay. I'm going to have to ask the person that's doing this, but I think that should still be possible. So basically, essentially.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  My two options are drop this to one and go down to one user and I can be on free plan, correct?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No. So you just need to drop this to one. There should be no automation workflows as well. So, back to admin panel. If you don't yeah, like hyperloop on the top, right?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Top, right? This one?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And then admin panel from the drop down. Yeah. Okay. Now, shared inboxes, click through on the gvs one that's active. Okay. Yeah. Just inside that automations real quick. Yeah, just making sure that you've got the right ones, just a sec. So you will need to remove all of these.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Okay. Then, remove this.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, like you'll have to delete them. You'll just disable them for now.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  That's okay. Let me just delete it right now. For sure. Let's just drop down to the free here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let's do that. All right. Click on SLA, on the left side.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  SLA?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. You've got nothing. Okay. Customer portal and all is fine. Click on integrations.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Integrations.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just making sure everything is good on that front. All right. So, from what I'm seeing, it looks like you're ready to be downgraded to free. Oh.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Actually, wait, you mentioned I have to delete the tags?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  So, I can just start deleting these honestly. So delete tag. What about? So basically, if there's going to be emails that has these tags, it's just going to kind of get removed, I guess, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just the tags will be removed. The email conversations would still be there.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Okay. That's good. Let me just do that. So you said it should only be just one, correct?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, any one, but just one?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Just go down. Okay?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Cool.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. You're good. And one last thing would be email templates. So on the left side, let's X out that pop up tray that we've got and click on email templates a little below the list. Yeah. All right. Can you click on that as well? So you've got four, you get one on free?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Okay. Just delete that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And these could technically be signatures on Gmail. Like the two scheduling links that you just deleted?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, you can like basically put that as Gmail signatures and you should be able to get by.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  I'm just going to take a screenshot of this.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And these could be canned responses again, standard Gmail.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Thank you. I appreciate that. For sure. Put this here for now.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Okay. We should.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Be good to go. So I'll raise a request with my support team to have your account downgraded to free after the call and have a full refund process for the November charge.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  No, I appreciate that. Raghav. Sure. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  My pleasure.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Okay. Is there anything else? Oh, and by the way, if you're going to downgrade that because I noticed this too. And again, you know, I'm not hating, I understand we got to increase revenue. Can you make sure that I'm not like subscribed and just automatically start getting charged for AI here?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No. So, the way we've got the AI trial running is that we'll just stop access and cut access to the features at the end of the trial. So, if by then you're not using or haven't, reached out to us, you're just going to not have access to the features that's about it.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Gotcha. Okay, perfect. Perfect. Sure. So, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  About the sales team that you were talking about future state?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Yeah. So, so, okay. So, but for this, you're after this call, you're going to process the refund and then just going to downgrade it to free. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure, it will take like a couple of days for my team to kind of circle back with the confirmation, I'm giving you that disclaimer as well. It's a federal holiday Tuesday next week. So give me to like Wednesday tops. And if by then you don't hear from me or the team just shoot me a note. I'll be sure to have that wrapped up for you.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Thank you. I appreciate it. Sure. All right. So now, let's have a conversation on the sale side because as far as I understand it, I… mean really I, you know, Alden was the one that kind of referred and recommended you guys, you know, based on his research, you guys are like a really good like ticketing system. It just makes everything easy within Gmail. And so my question to you is have you guys had any use cases of like, you know, huge like outbound sales team using hiver and like is there even any benefit to using hiver versus like we're just going to use like Gmail and just have all the templates in there. Like I'm just trying to understand like if… I'm if in my mind, I know that there's like cold email softwares out there that I can feed a list of like, hey here's the people that I need to outbound to. And, yeah, here's a bunch of like messages emails, campaigns. Every day. It's going to start emailing, blah blah blah. We've tried that. The problem with that is it's just like it's… very different because Gmail knows that it's kind of getting sent through like an app versus like me or having an actual person in Gmail, like actually like sending it one by one. That was my thought where I was thinking, Maybe if I, if instead of using a platform like that, we can have like a higher Deliverability?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. No, you know, from that perspective, mac, I'm going to put on my founder lens from like a year and a half back essentially. And, you know, we've been developing the outbound motion here as well as a business, right? So the email Deliverability and the spam control bit, Google just did like a massive control update. And so that's pretty much affected every business. Like just like what you've noticed, right? You've got outreach, you've got sales loft. You've got instantly quite a bunch of tools littering out there in the market. Yeah?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Yes, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It's sender Io that I was talking to the other day. So, yeah, anyways, long story short, when it comes to outbounding as it is today, in the current scenario for sales, you've got to have multiple domains and you've got to have them warmed up and you've got to, you know, be ready to run through quite a few of them and then replace them separately. Now, whether you're sending it through a scheduling software or sales outreach software or through hiver does not have too much of a difference for you as a business because in Google's eyes, it's cold emails. You're going in five people, mark you as spam, the high chances of that domain being blacklisted as a whole or blocked as a whole, that's just, you know, default Google filters at this point.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Now, with that said, to answer your question, I don't really see hiver being a great outreach or outbounding platform as well because the way we built the system, it could be a great addition to an outbounding platform or an outreach platform where for example, instantly kicks out 200 messages, you get replies for that instantly is technically not built for handling those responses in a way an inbox management software would, or a helpdesk would, right? So that's where hiver can fit into the puzzle for you. But if it's just about controlling spam and better Deliverability, it's bottom line, it's just the dnas we live in when we're doing sales outbound.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Got you. Okay. Well, I appreciate your, I appreciate your honesty on that Raghav. My pleasure. Yeah, I guess that's probably, I mean, the, and keep in mind, the, my line of questioning on hiver specifically, I understand that hiver necessarily won't help with the Deliverability. I was thinking more of instead of using instantly. We just use Gmail directly. That could potentially be better was my thought process. And then hiver is really more of like a management tool within Gmail. That was kind of my thought process, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, I appreciate the thought process. It's just that from personal preference both at hiver and outside. It's just that instantly will technically do a better job when it comes to Deliverability spam and just messages reaching to people at scale. And hiver could be more of an alternative when it comes to handling the replies that you get, keeping them organized, making sure it goes to the right person that's how you can or rather how I suggest you look at the full picture here.

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Got you. Okay. I appreciate that, Raghav. Yeah, I think you answered all my question. I appreciate your help on this, Raghav, and I will, I'll wait for your notification via email, okay?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Thank you so much for your time. I'll have your account downgraded. And hopefully at some point in the future, there is a chance or room for an email management tool like hiver to step in back into your team if the business evolves to that place until then, have a good time. Yeah?

McBilly's Fathom Notetaker (mcbilly@goodvibesquad.com):
  Thank you, man. Enjoy your weekend. Take care. Bye bye.
