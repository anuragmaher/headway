Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, Zach. Good morning.

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Hey, good morning, Rakesh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  How are you doing, sir?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well, thank you for joining in. Let me quickly introduce myself. This is the very first time we're catching up. My name is Rakesh. And I take care of sales at hiver. I've been with the company for over four years, have personally onboarded more than 500 teams and today, I'm going to be your point of contact, look into what your requirements and needs are, run the show and let you know if this is a good solution towards the end of the call.

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Sounds good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Now, to begin with, do you want to first of all, tell me, how did you hear about hiver? What prompted you on our website? And you filled in a form to talk to us?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah. So I like the integration that hiver had. I think right now, we're just looking for a solution that allows users to submit a ticket to us, possibly through text or even email, and then we could just easily respond to them through there.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Could you tell me which team is responsible to respond to these emails? Like what department is in question today?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah. So it'll be the it department.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And what do you use currently today for it? Like what's the process today?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  At least right now, like we use like this web help desk and, but we're primarily looking for like to support end users on the weekend, where we're out of the office and maybe they'll call in or they'll text one of us and we could just easily respond?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. So, are you saying that you guys do 24 or seven support and you need a solution that could predominantly help your users over the weekends?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Correct. Yep.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how about the phone calls? Like do you have a system in place today? Like what phone calls do you use today? Is that a telephony, is that a PBX? Is that a voip phone? What do you use for calls?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah. So currently, we use a voip phone, and we're even thinking of just downloading the app to forward the calls over to like our personal phone number?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And what voip do you use today? Can I know that?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah, it's called Avaya?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Let me make a note of it. And how about the texts? Do you have any way to manage these texts today? Or does that go directly into your mobile phones?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah, no. So at this moment, we don't have any way to, you know, manage the texts and that's what we're trying to set up.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood understood.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And how many emails do you predominantly get during a week and the weekends? Like any number of volume, any idea on those?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Maybe during the week, I'm still new to the company. So for me personally, during the week, I'll say like maybe around 100 for the week.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And that is inclusive of weekend as well. So, you're talking about all, in all, hundreds of emails in a week and you have back and forth on it.

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Oh, so, not the back and forth, maybe the back and forth will increase it to like 160.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, I see. Fair enough. And how big is your it team today?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Right now, we have about eight people.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is there a common inbox where every email get into or land into today? And then you kind of forward these emails to these eight folks manually, what's the process like?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah. So the process is end users will actually either call us or they'll send us like a individual like email to one of our email addresses. But right now, we don't have like a group email where like an end user could just email the group and one of us will respond.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood very clear. Are you open to creating an inbox, which is a common shared inbox without, you know, tweaking or changing anything in your existing workflow?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, if that's the way I'll tell you how a lot of my customers been using hiver now, once we create a group inbox, and that could be, you know, like a group inbox and outlook without incurring any cost. It could be something like it support at your company domain. Dot com. Now, once we have this group created in outlook, and we use the same group email address to set up hiver and invite all these eight folks and I'm assuming all eight users have their individual logins in outlook today?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Correct. Yep.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So everybody would simply log in into hiver with their outlook emails as a one time authentication. They can manage their personal emails on the top, which was anybody sending a personal email to sash. Or I get a personal email that took cash at hiver. I would have an option to manage these personal emails on the top inbox. And in the, it shared inbox, I would see all these requests which are sent by these users or the external world coming into that one unified place and which will be transparent to everybody. You'll have a complete visibility on how many tickets have been raised. And then you get an option to assign these requests amongst yourself in a team of eight folks. Okay. Now, apart from that, with regards to your phone calls, we integrate directly with Aircall. At the moment. I'll go ahead and check if I have a way to connect. Avaya. Give me a quick minute. But if that is Aircall, all we need is simply log in into hiver authenticate using Aircall. So let me just quickly check that. Give me one minute.

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah, no problem.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And help me just double check that the emails are today processed on Microsoft servers and not on Google workspace. Is that the right notion?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Correct. Yep.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Unfortunately, I take my words back. The phone calls for our product for Microsoft is not supported. We can still help you with the email management part of things where we could create a shared inbox first and help you manage all of the it requests in one interface. With regards to the chats, we can support chat as a mode of communication. If these do come on weekends and customers do even write you emails on weekends or they prompt on a specific chat request that could create a ticket for you. But with regards to the phone calls, we do not have it at the moment. I'll quickly check as to when are we looking to launch it. Give me one minute, please?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah. Is phone?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Call the absolute important thing for you because you received so many phone calls today or?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah, ideally. Yeah, either phone calls, text, you know, either one.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Because if you're looking to integrate phone calls then of course, while looking into the same platform, it does support the texts as well. So with Aircall and hiver integration, you still have an option to look at the text that your customers do send in because from that interface within hiver, you are able to reply or revert to those phone calls and revert to the text messages as well. Now, that works absolutely fine in Gmail. But here in your case, you are actually hosting emails on Microsoft. So, which is why I'm checking that it is not yet out and we have plans to launch telephone system most likely within this quarter itself towards the December end. So that's where we currently stand today. Any timelines for you to make a decision? Or is that still a very discovery phase for you? I want to make sure so that I can push this internally to my team.

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah, it's going to be as soon as possible.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. No, I get it. Dash, that's important for you to manage phone calls as well. But yeah, in the interim since we are connected, let me maybe show my screen and give you a quick walkthrough of no more than five minutes. And then we would love to reconnect as and when we have telephony integrated in hiver. And then it's absolutely one system that you're looking to manage your emails, your telephone calls, your texts. And even if we happen to put any sort of chatbot on your website. Cool. All right now, if you notice I'm logged in into app hiver. This is a web interface. And I'm using my outlook credentials. So every eight individual would simply log in into hiver account once we created, and they would use their existing outlook logins. They don't have to create new logins. And nothing as such. The very first thing that you notice on the top is the personal inbox. So any email sent to Zasha, at company domain, rukash, at company domain, I would see these personal email inboxes in my top. Now, these emails are not shared with anybody in the team. These are my private emails. The way I currently work on outlook. I can pretty much do exactly the same. Now, instead of these emails which are sent by our users personally, we would route all the emails to the support inbox. So let's say this is an it support inbox. Now, this is going to be a shared inbox for your it support. And like I said, once we create a shared inbox in your outlook workspace, we would use the same common email address to create a shared mailbox in hiver. For an example, if I take you to the admin inbox, when I create a shared inbox, I'll give the name. Let's say this is it support. And this is where you could go ahead and say, you know, what sort of it… would be essentially an email actually. Let's say it's a it support at… yourcompanydomain com. I'm just giving you a quick example so that you could understand exactly what I'm referring to. And then this could be an outlook user account, which essentially will incur some costs. But I would say if it is a shared mailbox or a distribution list, it won't have any, you know, you don't have to spend anything to create these two ways of making a mailbox inside your outlook. Now, once we do that, we continue with the setup and that's where you would have one of these mailboxes. For it support. If you notice these are the ones which are already set up in my test account. So this is how you would have a support inbox for it. And when you are inside the support inbox, then you would get an option to add all the eight members. Just simply put in their email addresses from outlook. And that's pretty much it. And in the top in the interface, you would have one unified solution like an interface to manage your it support tickets here. So the brand new requests will go to the unassigned bucket and that's where you turn on the automations at the backend. And you would see the first email goes to first Guy online, second Guy online. And I can pretty much manage my availability on the emails right? From here. The moment I log in every day, I can just simply go ahead and toggle myself on to work on the tickets and being an administrator, you can even manage the team availability. You can always say how many users are available for phone calls? I mean, sorry, chats versus emails. Once we launch, you would also have an option to look at these users to be online on phone calls as well. Nice. Alright. Now, apart from that, you would also see when I assign like for now, I don't have any new ticket here. I mean nothing has been unattended. Everything is like pretty much assigned to people. But let me give you a quick example. If I take you to mine section. So these are the emails that I am working on, and these are the technical support emails, the it requests for an example. Let's say if I am not a part of this email essentially, if this was a new email sent to you by a customer or anybody outside, they would simply write an email to it support at your company domain. And the new emails which are unattended will have a number right in front of here. And now these numbers are visible across everybody in the team. So I have a new ticket. Nobody looked at it. I opened the email what it is about? If this was a complex email, I'll go ahead and summarize the conversation with hiver's one quick, you know, summarize option. I'm sorry, this must be my internet. Okay. Let me take you an example. Maybe this one. And if I happen to summarize, it will actually go through the entire context of the email, generate a quick summary as to what must have happened so far in the email and what's the context? What is it? What is it that your employees or customers are asking for? The users are asking for now, once I open the conversation and this. Hiver activity panel. This inside stays inside, your, in your email life like this ticketing solution. And from here, you can choose to assign conversation to your colleague. Now that's a manual way of doing it. And like I said, automations are also right in place where you can automatically route any sort of email that talks about something in subject or the content of the email. And things like that. Nice status is open pending closed by default. We are working on these emails which is open. Otherwise, you can choose to put that in pending. Perhaps if this is something urgent or an escalation, and somebody has to take care of the escalation, maybe on Fridays. So I'll go ahead and, you know, put something on hold because we want to work on the pending emails later and you would see all the pending requests in the pending folder. And now this pending folder is shared amongst everybody in your team. So everybody gets to see who is the owner of these tickets, why are we keeping them in pending? Because it's a refund request. It's an escalation, it's an invoice on whatever the context is. And you can absolutely go ahead and, you know, tag that request as to why we are keeping something in pending. So all of these are possible through the tags, you can create any number of tags, share it amongst the team. These all are the statuses which are custom fields. Now, what is the email priority for you? It could be, is that a software request? Is that a hardware request? Is this something to do with any, it permissions? What is the type of the email? You could go ahead and choose all of these custom fields at the backend. And when you need to talk to your colleagues internally, without forwarding these emails manually, we literally do not recommend forwarding emails to each other because then it would actually clutter your personal inbox on the top. You would rather want everybody to simply stay inside the shared mailbox and at mention each other for that matter. Let's say, if I just at mention my colleague at the rate, Yukta. Hey, Yukta. Can you help me look at this one? Yeah, I would say, hey, Cole. Can you check this one? Please? Can you help? Now? This is basically we are actually talking to our colleagues internally and that's how the bell notification keeps updating me. If somebody at mentions me, somebody assigns me a new ticket and everything. And then I have a complete visibility on whatever is happening in the inbox without forwarding these emails manually to each other. Got it from team standpoint, when you want to know how many total requests are open up. You go into the team section and look at all the seven unattended… but these are assigned to folks. So you have a clearer visibility on if Cole takes a day off today, but there's one request he's already working on. You can always go ahead and put this request on rukash's, inbox. And from here, you could just see from the mind section, this would actually jump up from three to four. I would essentially work on four emails. Cool. All right now with regards to tags, like I said, you can create any number of tags, you can folder these emails under different tags. And then you want to find out how many of them are urgent requests, just simply go to the tag urgent. It will tell you this is the request. Why is this urgent? And who is this assigned to? And similarly, if it is a refund request, you'll go to the refund tag and you'll see all the requests which are opened up with regards to the refund. So that's how you can manage all your support emails better is to create a shared mailbox. And then hiver would work absolutely fine in terms of transparency visibility, the ownership on these tasks, it is not certainly recommended to have hiver on personal inboxes, because personal emails can have maybe salary slips from the HR folks or the finance folks. So we are not designed to work on personal inboxes, but you can still manage the personal emails right from one interface, so that you don't have to toggle between hiver and the master outlook account.

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, once you have a phone, once we have a phone system integration, just like you have it support mailbox right beneath it, where you see chat, you would also have a phone interface here just so that you could get to see a quick glimpse on how it looks like in our Gmail. Of course, I don't want to confuse you, but I do want to show you how the Gmail interface looks like with the phone call support. So that when we're looking at implementing something like this in outlook, you have a clarity on the phone support system. So give me one minute. Okay. Now, do you see, this air call phone here? So all I do is just simply log in into air call here and I manage the phone systems right from the shared inbox here. So I will have all the phone calls which are unassigned team calls. If anybody is actually working on any of those requests. And these phone calls been answered. If I want to look at the older conversations, I have everything pretty much, you know, sorted under the same inbox. Just like how I manage the it support. I have the same interface to manage the phone support as well. So that's how it's going to be the interface in your hiver for outlook also, which is not yet out. But I could tell you that by this quarter end, we are also launching the phone support system.

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Nice. It's great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Anything else in particular looking to achieve? I know for now, there are a couple of things that we do not do in hiver and I would love to reconnect with you as in when we launch it. But anything else in particular, I mean, otherwise, is this something that you're looking to achieve with a solution like this?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah, partly. Yes. I do want to ask. Is there a way to like export those logs? Or even like those internal notes that you added?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me quickly check that. Anything in specific you're looking to achieve with that? Like if you are able to export those?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah. Since we get audited like twice yearly and we're like a government contractor, we just need these like logs in specific to, you know, achieve that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, let me share what exactly we can export at this point in time and see if this kind of helps you with that. Now, if you notice right inside the analytics here, I go to the analytics bucket and look at the exports. Let's say, I'm looking at a new export and I would see the conversations that are happening here. I could choose any of those variables, look at the date range. I can further filter exactly what I need to export, maybe export with regards to emails which are assigned to anybody in the team, status of these emails could be closed pending open, like however you want to export it. Now, any emails with particularly under a specific tags, any conversation type of these emails. So basically all of these other, you know, custom fields also like you have appointment date, priority, doctor's name or whatever, you know, this could be anything as such, your custom domains and custom fields. Sorry. And then you see all of these variables through which you can actually go ahead and say, you know, you'll have tags, you've got assignees, customer satisfaction report. Anything to do with first response, who assigned it? All of that is pretty much possible to export it actually. So you see, I mean these are the custom fields and that will be helpful if you are actually particularly writing anything which is specific to a client. Now, any of this information can be exported. And this is, let me show you what is this information about? Now, when I go into the support inbox, now, if you notice this custom fields, these are the fields that you can absolutely use and export. Let's say I want to just use a text. So anybody customer, anyone who is working on a specific ticket request and they want to put in a certain request in format text or they want to bifurcate those requests in terms of let's say, what is the date criteria for that? Or anything to do with the name field? All of that is pretty much possible here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So you can choose to keep your data organized in these four formats and this can be exported for you by the way along with the other variables like how many tickets you're receiving, who is working on it? What not? When we worked on it? When did we close it? All of that, if you notice this?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  All right. Cool. Sounds good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. All right, josh. Anything else in particular, if we missed on anything? Otherwise, I'm going to be talking to my team to see if we could have integration with Avaya as in when we launched telefony. And I also understand that it's absolutely important for you because if you're looking at implementing a new solution, it should have everything in one place.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Otherwise, it makes no sense to have a different solution for telephone versus, you know, the email inbox and everything. Okay?

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Yeah, yeah, no, I think you touched on everything for today. If we could definitely like, you know, reconnect before the end of the quarter or, you know, at the end of the quarter, when you guys do push out the, you know, the phone integration that'll be nice, but everything that you went over today, definitely touched on everything.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. Thank you for your time, josh. And in the meanwhile, if you do happen to hop on a solution that does tick all the boxes, feel free to write back to me. But otherwise we'll be in touch. I'm keeping a task open for me and I'm going to be talking to my product team as in when we come up with telefony, I will definitely get in touch with you.

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  All right. Sounds great. Rakesh. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You're very welcome, sir. Thank you so much for your time as well. Enjoy the rest of your day. Take care. Bye.

Zachary Martin (zachary.martin@freqelec.com):
  Bye.
