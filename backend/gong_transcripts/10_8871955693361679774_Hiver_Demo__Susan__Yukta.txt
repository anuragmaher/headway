Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Susan. How are you? I'm good. How are.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  you doing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Well, thank you. Expecting more people to join in as well or shall we get started?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  We can get started? It's just me all.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right. Thank you for scheduling this with us today. Let me just quickly introduce myself. My name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver as well as your point of contact. So I'll be helping you with the evaluation today. So before we get started, I would just want to understand what made you look out for a tool like hiver, what is it that you're trying to solve so that accordingly, we can tailor the demonstration for you?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Okay. So we're a digital marketing agency. We do website designs, we do any kind of digital marketing. We've been around for over 30 years. We have a remote team. We normally, we use basecamp and we use Asana and we're kind of in a place where our clients don't really like basecamp because, you know, you have to sign into a different platform. It's not very intuitive on mobile. You know, we've got some clients that just flat out refuse to use it personally in terms of project organization. I do like basecamp because we keep every client as a project. I've got messages back 20 years from clients that have been with us for a long time. That I can always search and go through kind of what we're looking for is… and I looked at hiver, you know, more of a not really ticketing system but where certain account managers can, you know, send the messages, fill the messages, create an Asana task, you know, get it to the right person, get things done. My question is how does hiver store the messages that's my, that's the big thing I cannot, you know, determine how they store the messages, how we would organize it per client, that type of thing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And when you say messages, what exactly do you?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Emails like just messages to and from clients, you know, talking about their marketing strategies, that type of thing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So these are the, these are emails that you're referring to right? With, with your clients that happen between with account managers. So I'm assuming you would have account managers assigned to each account and that's how they're connected with the clients and that's how the conversations are flowing today. Is that right?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Yes, that would be great. What I do like about basecamp is everybody in the whole company, anybody, you know, can go through and look at messages. It doesn't have to just be someone on the team or that account manager. You know, there's, the company has access to all communications and that part of it I do like. But like I said, our clients prefer don't are now preferring just to email us versus go through basecamp. And everything's you know, get stuck in individual emails versus on one platform. So we're just trying to find a solution got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It, so communication is also sort of happening from the individual accounts of these account managers. I'm assuming that you don't have any generic email address at which your clients write and then it gets distributed to who needs to work on that email.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Yeah, we have a staff at email. And for some clients who just have just determined they're not going to use basecamp. We've made some exceptions just to see how it works. Where we've got an account manager that's checking our staff at email just for that client. But again that, you know, yes, the team can go in staff at email and they can look at the communication. But going in basecamp is just so much easier because everything's there versus signing into an email, another email and then getting it that way. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So basically, see basecamp Asana are the project management tool, right? Where you can actually track the entire journey of your clients on this platform. Not just the email is one part that's more of a communication and how that is handled, but the entire progress on what's actually happening within that project which is ongoing with any customer that's the information that you and the customer are able to get from basecamp, right? So hiver can help you with the communication part wherein if you have a use case wherein you would like to sort of have a centralized place to be able to track these emails that customers are writing, which is that staff at the rate, that is where hiver can come into the picture… help the team sort of understanding which email is coming from, which customer who needs to take care of it. You can assign those emails and accordingly, you know, sort of distribute the ownership there. And it will only work for the emails that are being written at staff at the rate and not to the individual account managers, email addresses. Even if they receive those emails within their respective accounts, they can move those to the shared mailbox as well for everyone's visibility. But this would be the part wherein hyver could come into the picture. But I'm still not sure what exactly you're trying to solve here by replacing a basecamp, because if the customers are not liking basecamp, that's a project management tool. So do you want to replace it with a similar sort of solution or something which is more of a customer service platform or a shared mailbox platform?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Yeah, I've looked at some other platforms out there to replace basecamp. I've looked at what is it? Clickup? I've looked at a bunch of those, but all, in terms of, you know, what hyver does in terms of the account manager's, communication to the clients and from the clients. I think that's what hyver would fix would be that problem. You know, we could still copy paste put, you know, basecamp could still be a reporting tool for our team based on communication and things that are needed. I mean, it definitely, we could use that until we found something else. But where, like can you show me the dashboard in like how it's set up in hyver? How would you know? I think you have to integrate with another tool for it to automatically do a Sana task, correct?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So basically hyver works or connects on Gmail. So you can actually access and manage your shared inbox within your Gmail itself. So everybody can just log into their respective Gmail accounts from where they can manage their primary inbox like they do today. And then we will create a shared inbox like you can see in, I have different folders here here too. So let me take an example of the support inbox. Let's say this, we will connect or we'll create one shared inbox that will be connected with your staff, email address, staff at the rate. And from there, you would have these sections to define your day to day workflow, right? Any email that comes in, any clients that writes on this email will come into the unassigned section. And from there, you can actually open any email and give the ownership firstly as to who needs to work on that email, across all account managers. So they can assign it. We can also automate this process so that we don't necessarily have to do this manually. The integration parts are gonna happen here within the app section. So we have native integration with Asana. So let's say currently this ticket or this email is assigned to me. I am working on this email based on this. If I need to sort of update anything within Asana within my tool, I can do that within here itself. You will be able to see the entire information about this client and whatever that you need to get. I wouldn't have the live connection at this point, but yeah, you can create any task as well based on that, if you'd like fill these fields and then you can basically, you know, push some data back into Asana from here itself based on the communication.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Yeah. So you could just copy the email, click Asana and it would create the Asana task.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can do that. So you can manage the communication part here, exchanging emails, keeping the communication rather simplified. So each account manager can handle their respective number of emails. You can create tags as well to further categorize which project is this email about. So you can actually create tags to categorize based on each project. Is one way of categorizing that's coming on top of my mind right now so that it's easier to then understand what this email is about, which project it belongs to. And AI also helps you sort of automate this process here. And while you're responding to any email, you can also leverage on AI co pilot here. So you can actually train AI on your company resources. You can feed data in respect to different projects that you currently work with. The entire historical dump that AI can train itself on. So that whenever you're working on any email, if you need to respond to the customer or a client, you can just ask AI to draft that response for you and you can just insert that here. And it's good to go. So that's how you can manage your day to day emails. But this is going to be for your internal usage itself. So hiver usage is for your internal team. This will not be available to your clients. They would just be normally writing emails and you'll be just handling those from within here.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Yeah, because we use the Google workspace, and Gmail. So this is good. Is there any way for the messages to live in folders in Google docs or in Google workspace? Your?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Emails are going to remain as emails within Google workspace, since it's already sitting on Gmail. So nothing's going to be missed. It's going to remain within your Google workspace itself.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Okay. All right. Okay. I'm trying to think if I have any other questions. So this just really puts the communication in everyone's… Gmail, although it's not their individual. I mean, this is their individual whitestone marketing, Gmail accounts, but within their own emails, you can go to support and find all of the hyper messages, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So you'll be also tracking the progress from this status here. So open pending closed, you can find all the open emails. So all these section on the sign my team section are going to contain all the open tickets or open emails that we are working on currently as a team and we'll have full visibility in terms of who is handling what. So that if someone else needs to pitch in, they can just do that themselves quite easily. And then you would have all your pending emails within here and all your closed ones right here. So you would have everything here. The original emails are going to still be there in your staff Gmail account. So nothing's going to be missed there. Hiver is just helping you sort of organize that inbox that already exists and giving you that view for everyone to be able to access that from their respective Gmail accounts. And that's what hiver is doing here.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Is there a way to tag each message based on a client? Because like I said, like when you go, yeah. So when you go, okay, so I could, we could have a tag because when you go to your like closed, you know, that's just a bunch of emails. We have a ton of clients. So I mean how do you, like I said basecamp? I know that that's different, but basecamp does get their emails and it goes straight into their project. So we can, you know, we can look at a client, a particular client project, and every email, every file, everything is in that project from basecamp.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Excuse me, you can do that. We can do that. We can create tags for each customer or each client. So that it's a lot more easier from the visibility perspective. And also all those tags are going to store here. So whenever you want to just look into one client emails and all the communication happening with that client, you can just go into that tag and then just, you know, pull all the emails in that. Also, you can create your own custom views in hiver. So if you want to see anything specific, for example, for a specific person working on working with a specific client on a specific project, let's say, and you want to pull that report, only you can create that view as well and, you know, get that and save it for yourself or for everyone. So you can also create these custom views for yourself for ease of reference. Like similar to what you have in basecamp. Yeah. How many customers would you have for Suzanne? If I ask, I would.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Say, probably 100 100 clients. We have a team of about 20 people now, not everybody would need access to this although I'm not sure because even, if our design team is working on a website, they need to know the messages. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. We'll have to figure out how many people would actually have to have access to it or do we just use the account managers? The design team coordinator gets a message and then she creates an Asana task for the designers. I mean, it could be something like that. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  How many people do we have in the account management team?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Let's see one, two, three, four, five, six, six, I guess.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Six people. Okay? And then the rest, I'm.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  sorry, I was going to say but I probably would need to be included in that as well because I have to go through and make sure everything's running smoothly and there's no, yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, yes, you can be there, so.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  I would want to be able to go in. So probably, I don't know seven eight, something like that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Gotcha. Yeah. Makes sense. So, we can look into that and you would then also can go into the analytics to just understand, get a bow dive view. In terms of what's really happening? How are we handling these emails? How are these sort of, you know, separated for each customer? How does the traffic look like? So all of that can be seen here as well in analytics. Just give me a moment for some. Yeah, it's taking.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Too much.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Time. I think it's just my internet. Sorry for that.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  That's no problem. Let's try this again.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  It's okay. Oh, there you go.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Finally got it. Okay. I think it's just my internet. I'm sorry for that. Okay. So in the analytics, you can sort of see how the inbox is performing. How does the traffic look like? It gives you the workload distribution on top? And then you see the performance for each individual. How are we, you know, sort of going about handling these communications? So you can actually fetch different reports. This is for conversations. And likewise you have for each user. So for each individual who's part of this inbox, you can see separately how these emails been distributed, what's the average time for everyone to be able to, you know, get to those emails, close them on time. You can see it for each tag. So you can also look into for each customer if you have that categorized. And this will give you a holistic understanding on a timely basis in terms of how this looks like anything specific within analytics that you would be interested in or?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Something? No. I mean, we've got a great team. They're very responsive. I mean that's not the. problem. The main problem is, no, is our clients don't like basecamp, and they, you know, they get a message from our team. It does go to, their inbox, got it, you know, but, they have to click the subject line to get back to basecamp. It's not, it's not mobile.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And they want to stay.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Within.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Inbox itself. Like would they prefer other communication happening within their inbox itself than going into the platform? Okay? And I think that's the reason that's where we have now connected the dots as to why you're looking out for a tool like hypo. That makes sense? Yeah.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Yeah. Now, does this… work? So obviously, we're going to have a ton of messages poured into our Google workspace. How does that, how does that space work? Cause, I mean we have clients, like I said in basecamp, I have clients that have been with us for 15 to 20 years, and all of their messages are still in there. How does that work with my Google workspace? In terms of how much space it takes up all the messages. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You do not have those emails within your Google workspace. Now? Are they all like only on like basecamp?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Yes. Oh.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's interesting and you would like to like sort of import it within hiver, or would you rather import it within your own repository, for references? Like because I would want to understand if you would want to import all of this in hiver, I'm talking about a lot older emails and not the recent ones. Any reason why you would want to do that rather than, you know, sort of chemical probably.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  You know, we wouldn't, we would do it just going forward. You know, we would find a way, to either get all of the messages or just say, okay, maybe those aren't important anymore. Yeah… yeah, this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is this is more of a Google workspace question, right? It's up to you. It has nothing to do with hiver. Either ways, if you are starting with hiver, we'll be connecting your stuff mailbox, you have an option to import your historical emails from staff email address or that account, so you can go back into history as much as you want. And you can, we can always import that email so that you can see all of those within the closed section here for past conversation reference as far importing from bootcamp to either to your workspace account or somewhere else is up. It's your decision, right? As to where?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Yeah… but yeah, I'm not.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, please.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Go ahead. I'm just more concerned about, the overall number of messages, and so, it's not, so the number of messages don't live on hiver, they actually live in my Google workspace, right? Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, all.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Right. So, we just have to make sure because, I mean, like I said, it is a ton, it's a lot of messages. It's files. It's lots of different things that come through basecamp to live in basecamp now, and it's all of that go. If we decide to change this, all of that would be going into Google workspace. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That'll be going.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, I'm still assuming that customers are writing on email addresses, right? Whether it's to account manager or to the staff email address, are they not already staying on Gmail?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  No. Do you want me to share a moment and I can show you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. If you could do that, I think that'll.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  yeah. Yeah. I think this might make it easier. Okay? So if I go to basecamp, this is basecamp. So, for example, I have all my clients here, right? And Carmel country inn, for example, this property. If I go down to her messages, you can see, no, that's not the one I wanted. Hold on. Let me just show you one. If I go to chesterfield, okay? And I go down here and I'm like, okay, let me look at all the messages. Let's see where is it? It used to say how many pages? I mean, she's been a client of ours for 15 years. So you can see I have pages and pages. I mean, I used to go down and say how many pages, but, and then files, if I even look at files, I got 28 pages of files for this client.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's a lot. Yeah.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  And not that I'd move that to hiver, but I'm saying, you know, just today, you know, she's already sent, you know, this message, you know, more, tons of messages. So what happens is when we create a message in basecamp, you know, we create our message, we do what we ever want to do and we click and it can either it goes to these people's, emails, regular email.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood understood. Okay. So I think that's really what it's covering is just giving notifying them that there is a new message within the tool and then everything being is being handled within bootcamp or basecamp itself. So I think that's how it is. So I would personally suggest to actually look out for a similar tool as basecamp because what you have shown me is quite extensive, which is actually involving a lot of steps and you know, back and forth happening in regards to any ongoing project with your client at a time, right? I'm not 100 percent sure if hiver using something like hiver at this point is going to solve that because this is more of a ticketing tool use case wherein the use case would be that wherein you would like to just handle the day to day emails coming in from different customers and you have a team who would like to just close them. And that's what you want to just track or fasten the process in terms of responding or getting on getting to these emails. But what you're showing me is more of a internal or larger picture wherein you're actually working with your clients on a day to day basis on something that's ongoing and that's covered by tools like Asana basecamp and all. So, yeah. Yeah. So I'm not sure if, but does this make sense? I mean, whatever it?

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Does it does? And, you know, I know the CEO does want to get to where like just a couple people on our team are looking at, you know, not really a call center type of thing, but I know he's looking at, he is interested in that and that's where hiver would come in. But I just, I'm just trying to figure out. I'm also wondering is like through basecamp, can we not use an email that would actually work through hiver? And then the messages, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So what you can do it so you can look at it as a complimentary solution, right? Wherein you can have your day to day communication emails which clients are getting annoyed to go to basecamp for everything. Rather, you can have those email exchanges within hiver and within your Gmail itself. And then you can just connect your external tools like Asana basecamp here within hiver to further get redirected. Update anything if you need to, within that project that's ongoing, create any tasks there if you want. So all of that is possible from hiver itself. So you don't even have to go back and forth between hiver and your project management tools. So this can definitely be used to manage your communication with your clients on Gmail itself.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Okay. All right. Well, I'm going to keep thinking about it. I appreciate some information. You know, I'm going to look at, see if there's a way if we used like support at whitestone in basecamp, but it came through hiver, if it would not still go. I don't know. I'll have to look. I'll have to decide hiver is not going to be.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  mentioned anywhere. Hiver is just for your internal usage. It's more of an organization, yeah, organization tool, right? It's not going to hinder anything or hamper anything. You're just managing your same emails which you would otherwise do within staff at the rate Gmail account that's just, you know, giving you a different view with hiver and that's all that's happening. Rest of the things just remain as it is.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Right. I get it. I get that. Okay. Have you worked with any other platforms… like basecamp that you like? Because I mean, I don't mind changing it, but gosh, it just has worked so well. It's just one of our clients. It works well on desktop. If someone's sitting at a computer, it works extremely well, you know, they click on the subject, they can answer, they can do that. But if they're on their phone, it does not work well, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I can understand. So, yeah, I think in any tool that you use in terms of like project management tools, that could be an issue that you would face. Hence what I have seen personally with our customers who use tools like Asana basecamp, they keep their communication within Gmail itself. And I think that's the difference that I'm seeing from, you know, your workflow is that you're doing that communication also from that tool itself. And that's why maybe you're just seeing this friction. But yeah, I mean, let me know if you would like to explore. We have a trial as well. So if you want, you can try this, see how it works, how customers are liking it now in terms of exchanging those emails and keeping rest of the things within the other tool.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Okay. Well, you know, this is, I'm just kind of exploring some ideas and then obviously, I got to talk to, you know, the owners of the company and kind of put forth what I think might work. I just have to figure out, I just don't want messages to get lost. Like if something's living in Gmail, you know, I want the whole team to have access to the messages so that they can act on things they need to act on. And I just don't know.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  I don't know, well, I'll have to, I'm still thinking so I will let you know if I have any other questions. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. Suzanne, let me know. I'll be sharing some details over the email, so you can always reach out to me there itself whenever you're ready or if you'd like to explore this further so we can take it up from there.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  All right. Thank you so much. All right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. Thank you for your time. Take care.

Susan Galvin (susang@whitestonemarketing.com):
  Bye. Okay. Bye bye.
