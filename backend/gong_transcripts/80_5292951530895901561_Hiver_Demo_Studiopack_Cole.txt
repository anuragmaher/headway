Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's up, rob? How are you? I'm good. How's everything with you?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Good, good. It's Friday can't complain?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I know, right? Thank goodness. Where are you calling out of?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Raleigh, North Carolina?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, very cool. Very cool.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  How about you? I think you're on the east coast too, aren't you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, I'm based out of Brooklyn, New York.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Nice.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I've been here for a couple years now. Love it out here.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Awesome. Yeah, my husband's from long island. Okay? So, I've been up to the city a few times, traveled around the state a couple of times, just the island and the city. Yeah, nothing outside of there, you know, because none of his family lives anywhere else. So there's no reason for us to go anywhere.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, long island's gorgeous though. It's a nice area. It's dense, but it's pretty, but I appreciate, you know, hopping on the call here though, Roger.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So just to set a quick agenda, you know, we'd love to just understand from your perspective, what got you interested in hiver, and then, you know, we can just kind of take the call from there.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Beautiful. So, full disclosure. I am like a fractional consulting service for high volume photography studios. Yeah. And what I do is I find them solutions to automate their workflows, their task management and their communication services. So that's kind of what I'm here to do today is to see if hiver is a great fit for that because we refer to front. And I'm not a fan of them trying to give me everything odd like self service is what they're trying to do. And I don't like that because I'm like actually I need to like talk to somebody to talk out how this all works and make sure that it's going to function in the way that I think it is going to function. For example, just to talk a little bit about like the 10,000 foot view is that my current client has three brands, two of which are going into a task management software that has automated emails. And what those automated emails will do is they'll send from a no reply. And then we're expecting to be able to insert some type, some tokens. So that way they get flagged based off of the brand of the business they need to be assigned to. So, for example, a is with move up images and B is with digital solutions. And we want to make sure a doesn't get crossed to where B should go and vice versa. And the idea, is how I was referred to front is that we would use tokens and like the subject line. So that way we don't care about where the emails are coming from in automation. But when they go to reply and feedback in through front or whatever software we put here, we can have the reply to email based off of the tokens in the task management software to deliver to the correct reply to email address, and then funnel it all in one inbox, which is ultimately the goal because currently, a very archaic process is they have like five browsers open with five separate inboxes. Yeah. And that irks me a lot. And so that is the goal if any of that is making sense or if I did a good job of explaining it. I understand it. I've never implemented anything like this which is why I'm glad I get to talk it out because I want to make sure that I'm understanding how this can work if I'm understanding correctly at all and what part of y'all will play into it as well. If you're just like here's, the software do your own connecting of the dots on the end for the tokens and things. Like that, just a little bit that's the information I need to know.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it sounds like they have five separate mailboxes that they're managing, right? They have five tabs open to manage those five separate mailboxes. Okay. So are they using Gmail today, your client?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, yeah, I can just share my screen and show you how we set this up just to give you that idea. And then we can just kind of take it from there.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Beautiful. And that's my note taker by the way. Obviously, as it says, Roger's note taker. So because I like, I've realized that if I'm going to use AI, I want to use it as a tool. I don't want to do things for me. So it's here to take notes. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Love that. But taking a look at my screen here though, Roger. So what we do is we take those, you know, shared mailboxes, Google, groups, whatever they might be, and we turn them into these yellow hiver folders on the left hand side. So all those people just log in with their normal Gmail, like, you know, they'll keep doing their normal day to day login with their personal address, and then they'll access the shared mailboxes on the left. So into it, right? As you click into the support mailbox, it breaks it up into those sub views like the unassigned section, the mine and then the team. So understanding whatever on the team is currently working on what's outstanding, what needs to be completed in that mailbox. The mine is everything that's been assigned to me. And then the unassigned are new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be delegated out either via automation or manual assignment. So going into the unassigned, right? I'll just click on, let's say like this one right here. So what's nice about hiver is we give you this little hiver tab within Gmail. This can be opened or closed to help us manage the intake of that communication. So the first thing we can do is assign it to someone. In this case, I'll assign it to myself. Letting the team go. I'll follow up. We can also do round Robin, and then we can also do like a skill based routing like identifying the domain in the email, identifying keywords, in the body of text phrases, in the body of text, whatever that might be. And then routing it to that person who has that skill. Just want to pause here, Roger. Any questions so far?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Nope. So far it's making sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. Then we got the status whether it's like open pending or closed, making sure nothing slips between the cracks, adding those tags for organizational purposes as well as analytical purposes on the backend and then custom fields, another way to view data, take action on it, report on it, search on it. You know, these are kind of like a CRM fields that you can customize to collect different data and things of that nature. And then the collaboration aspect. So being able to collaborate internally, it's being like, hey, can you help with this? I'll send that notification to matt. He'll receive that notification right up top right here. He'll click on it. It'll take him to this thread. We'll keep having that back and forth. Maybe he'll use our AI summarizer to understand what's going on with the conversation. He can see the AI sentiment analysis to gauge how the client's feeling. We can also route based on this sentiment analysis. And then we also have an AI co pilot for drafting replies. So pulling information from your sources. I'm going to escalate this select option three.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then I'm going to insert this into the draft.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Nice. I like that. I like that a lot.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And just curious more about this, like who is the, I mean, I'm sure you can't say who it is, but like what kind of company is the company you're working with?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  So I can't say who it is. They're called scholastics, images… moveup images, digital solutions. They're out of Nebraska. They've went through a lot of growth over the last couple of years. And what started off as just like owning one business has ended up into owning three businesses. Yeah, in a very short amount of time and they want to grow even more. But luckily, they understand the importance of like having all of this figured out to grow on versus still trying to like do it by the seat of the fans because currently it's managed by like three spreadsheets seven, five inboxes and a Monday board, which is not ideal. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's a lot.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Not ideal at all. Yeah. And it opens up a lot of human error too. And so that's why I'm very eager to get this figured out because honestly, once this part of it is figured out because we figured out the task management workflow once we figure out the communication part of it, making sure the brands can be separate in their responses, it doesn't matter again, the reply to emails, the most important thing is making sure they go to the right place when those emails are routed.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. 100 percent. And as you can see, you can create those mailboxes on the back end and every mailbox has a different email address associated with it for organization and stuff like that.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Yeah, I like that because I think what will end up working best for them is just splitting it by brand because the way their brands are broken down is their brands approach the same thing in two different ways. Yeah, one does a proofing model and then one does a prepaid model. So it's all the same steps they're just in order of operation. So I think between the shared inboxes, eventually, this is where I want to get them as to like there's a support there's, production, there's client services. And then there's photographers, and that's the point I want to get them at. But right now you've answered, you know, I see exactly what I need to do and how well not exactly what I need to do, but I see how that they're already going to split it up based off of the emails that they have since it's based off of a region, so to speak, in brand. Yeah. So it makes sense how it's going to happen. I just don't have the knowledge of how to engineer it and how those tokens and everything will work.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes. So our team and how many people would be using this from the client side? So you're going to implement this for them like you'll be, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  So there'll be me, the owner who was, who's Megan. She's on the invite for this call. She just couldn't make it today because of something that came up which is a story of most studio owners lives like a photographer calls out, a school, says the images were edited wrong or a team calls and says there's a misspelling for the team name on the product they've made. So that happens frequently. But it'll be the two of us and probably four other people, which would be the territorial managers. And then the production manager. And then one more would be the customer service person who actually goes through and does the replies for most of like, you know, I'm missing an order. When is picture day going to be scheduled though makeup day? She'll handle those kinds of things. And the territorial managers will be there to handle the deliverables like id cards and composites here's, marketing material for this brand. Here is the ordering link to pass out to the parents for that brand. So I think seven of us in total would be the max that we would have.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, like max seven people. Yeah. Okay. So that, so just so you're aware too, we do sell in buckets of five. So like five, 10, 15, 20. So that would put you to the 10 bucket. But because you're buying more licenses, I am also able to provide a discount.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Okay, good. And the other thing would be that having the ability to add other people isn't a bad thing either because we're there's a good chance we get a little bit further down the road and we recognize that someone needs to be in a different place or someone does better at this position. So that's good to know that we can just have a seat for them to move on to.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. And we'll also like for the 10 licenses on our pro plan too, that will provide you with like implementation and onboarding services. So you will have someone who's going to help guide and set this up with you and the team.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Beautiful.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But when would you be looking to be up and running with something like this for the team? What kind of makes the most sense for next steps here?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Well, that's a great question because I, this is kind of like their lull, right? Because school photos are over there's. Some winter sports going on but it's nowhere near as hectic or as cumbersome as it is when doing like school pictures in the volume world. Yeah. So I'm looking to implement this by the end of the year. So we've got a long runway, to get it up and going. My, I've the biggest lift has been done which was when we set up the task management software, we had to create all the parent contacts like the name of the school or the district, and then we had to add the contacts of the districts and schools in there. So the heaviest lift of this whole process has already been done as far as the communication base and making sure the right people are connected to the right accounts. What comes now, is making sure that we set up this part correctly? And I'm thinking in the next three to four weeks we would want to be set up and testing to prepare for like the very small spring stuff that comes in like January.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  So we've got a pretty easy runway if something happens in four weeks and we have to push it out till closer to the end of the year, that's cool. But we don't have a immediate hard stop since we're coming down at the lull of the season. Cause we also have to train everybody on a few things too. So getting everyone together and cause I have to go up there in person to do it. So getting everyone together to implement this like to show them to it. I, those things aren't always, I'm not too worried about that part. I'm more worried about we get it done right? So if I was to give myself a goal, I'd want to do it in four weeks. If I'm being realistic on how long we really have, we have until the end of the year.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So should we look to touch base in like a couple weeks like towards the end of the month too? And is this something that like do you pretty much have the go ahead, to purchase something like this? Or would you need to get buy in from the owner?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  I would need to get buy in from the owner, which is not going to be that difficult given what front was going to charge us, cause you haven't said pricing yet, but I have a feeling based off of seat count, it's going to be drastically cheaper than what they were going to go in especially considering they had their own like software hub and you're kind of like your software is like an application plugin. So, what?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Were they, what did they quote you guys?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Front quoted us like 380 a month?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  380 a month for 10 users. Okay. Got it.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Yeah. So if we can, if we can get something, you know, a bit better than, that would be, that would be ideal. I, what I would say the next meeting, would be me, you and the owner meeting. So that way we can go through pricing, we could go through what setup's going to be, cause by the time the three of us have that conversation, her and I have already had the conversation with the task management software and made sure they're all good to go. Like we've said everything. We've dotted our I's we've crossed our T's, all we got to do now is set up communications and make sure the automation of the emails we want to do is working. Yeah, and going to the right placing. So the testing of that. So by the time the three of us meet, we would already be ready to like, okay. Hey, these are the decisions that need to be made.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And when would be a good time for y'all to go over pricing before we like talk like, you know, establish like a partnership or anything like that. But when would be a good time on the calendar for you?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Let me.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hold this up for next week.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  So, I'm actually in person with them, I fly out there the seventeenth of November through the 20 first. So sometime during that week, her and I can find a place for the two of us to sit down and be like, hey, we need to have this conversation. So I'm thinking anytime between the week between the seventeenth and the 20 first, preferably the eighteenth through the twentieth because seventeenth and the 20 first are actually my travel days.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Why don't we do the nineteenth same time as now?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Beautiful. And if you can feel free to us include Megan, her email in that invite.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So if you have Megan sockel at Gmail. Com. Yeah.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  Yep.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, yeah, I invited you and Megan for November nineteenth at three 30 to discuss like pricing. And then, yeah, we'll just go from there. I'll follow up with, you know, the pricing link, this call recording and some other information that you can share Roger with the team if they want to review hiver to see how it works. And then, yeah, we'll just go from there.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  I would love that. Yeah, any information you can provide me that I can take to them and be like, hey, this is how the process is going to work. This is how processing implementation any of that. Feel free to send them my way. I'm going to get in front of their faces.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. I appreciate that, Roger.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  I appreciate you Cole, I really do because I was kind of stressed about the whole situation of whether or not I was like, I know I'm not dreaming when I know these things can be done… like, I'm not crazy.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You're like we don't need 15 tabs open?

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  No, no, you don't and seven of those tabs is four spreadsheets, some inboxes, and a Monday board, and none of them talk to each other. It's all me. Oh, my goodness. And I'm like, oh, we can't do this anymore. We can't we can't so, I appreciate your time. I really do, and I'm looking forward for us to getting this set up and getting started with hiver. All.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Perfect. No, I appreciate it. I'll talk to you soon, Roger. Have a great weekend.

Roger Pack (roger@thestudiopack.com):
  You do the same bud. Thank you all.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Bye.
