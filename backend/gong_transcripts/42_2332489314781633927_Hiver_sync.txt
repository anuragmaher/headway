Mikes1410:
  hi, Mike. Good afternoon.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  How are you doing today? I.

Mikes1410:
  Am well, how about yourself?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'm good, Maya's here as well.

Mikes1410:
  Maya will be joining us momentarily. I believe. Yeah, there she is fantastic. We were just chatting a second ago, getting ready for the meeting here.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hi, Maya. How are you doing today? Can you hear me? Okay. Perfect. Yeah, thanks for the time. Thanks for jumping on. I know we spoke, I think briefly earlier this week about a trial extension which I made sure that we sent over to you, but yeah, I'm here to understand how things have been going, feedback for me. Any questions that I can help with. And then we'll take it from there.

Mikes1410:
  Okay. Well, I will say I'm going to let Maya take the lead on that generally, but I will say that our, we've been having some issues and specifically, Maya's been having some issues with separating her account from keeping the previous platform we were using, which has interfered with her ability to test hiver to its full extent. So right now, we are working on aggressively getting our team out of that system so that we can continue doing testing on the candidates that we're looking at for a replacement. But yeah, beyond that, I'll let Maya take the lead.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Anything I can help with the decoupling of the system? Anything that is, if there's something specifically impacting hiver, I mean, UI, maybe I'm not sure, but if it's anything impacting hiver, I'm happy to look into it.

Mikes1410:
  The main thing is that it's the… filters that are set up to shunt the keeping tickets into the archive and keep them out of the main inbox isn't… functioning properly. So, all of these tickets are flowing into Maya's testing instance. But yeah, we've got a ticket with keeping. And I mean, like I said, we're basically, the plan is to be fully out of that system by the end of this week regardless. So, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, perfect. Yeah, let me know if I can help with that we've dealt with as you can imagine a lot of these transitions. So anything in terms of filters and reviews that my team and I can help with. We're happy to do so.

Mikes1410:
  Excellent. Well, Maya, did you have any questions or feedback to provide?

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  I don't think I have anything specific other than there… was one feature I saw that had to do with let's see if I can get it pulled up… a thank you detector. And I was wanting to see how that worked. Like does it not reopen the ticket if it specifically only says thank you and nothing else? Or if it says thank you and then something else in it, does it not reopen the ticket as well?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No, no. If it's thank you and something else. We definitely do want it to reopen the ticket. If it is thank you or various versions of that where there's not too much other substance in there. Our AI does close it. But at the end of the day, what we do is we err on the side of safety. So whenever AI is not sure which as you can tell at least at this stage, it's not, sure, 100 percent, right? So in cases where it maybe is not sure, we do err on the side of caution and open it up for you anyway. And if you do end up in that scenario end up thinking that, hey, this actually didn't require any assistance. I'm just going to close it anyway, it learns from that and tries to figure out and improve itself for the next time, right? So that's typically how it is set up. And, yeah.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Awesome. Cool. So as Mike was saying, it's my inbox is kind of, I guess the best way you could say it looks gross right now because I shouldn't have as many emails in my inbox as I do. And with it marking all my emails as it's in my personal email. So it's going to my personal inbox and my hiver inbox as well. So might not have been the best way to test that. But all of the extra sales support emails that I'm getting are just making it a little more difficult to look at things, but I was able to go through a lot of stuff and look at things and it's essentially looking like a lot better version of keeping and it seems to have all of the things that we wanted within keeping that wasn't available or just didn't work.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Yeah. I mean it's something that we've tried to do which is why sort of that sort of reflects in where we sort of stand in any of these rankings of all the different. There are so many different tools at this point. You're probably going to be able to evaluate maybe at least a 10 if you really wanted to. So. But then what we've tried to do is really focus on keeping the core offering the focus and building that out. And that's sort of like reflected all our third party software. In the meantime, my, what I want to do is ensure that we don't disrupt or do more disruption to what you're seeing right now. Already. So anytime anything in terms of sort of resetting your account instead of marking stuff as closed for now, any sort of resetting your account, any sort of cleanup, any sort of like back end assistance, let us know. My team and I are happy to assist with that. So for example, you're saying, hey, by Friday, we're done with keeping the account is working well again, everything up until Thursday, can you just like close it out so that I don't have it cluttered in hiver? We can help you with that. And what I can also do is given that we're probably not even going to be able to fully test by Friday, I'm happy to extend your trial even further into next week through the end of next week, just to make sure that we've got enough time to evaluate, ask questions, donorize, cross our T's.

Mikes1410:
  Appreciate that.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  There's a request for that right now. Just give me one second.

Mikes1410:
  And my eye… one thing we could do just like get you out of keeping entirely today is just disable you as an agent in keeping. I don't know if that's something that you'd be comfortable with. And I don't know if you're access to the app version or not with Nikki out. That makes me nervous now that I'm thinking about it.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Yeah. I think since I'm technically the only admin watching the inbox right now, it would make sense for me to be in there. But if we're having it extended through all of next week, I have an entire week that I can just test and I can probably even get the… sales support inbox set up in hiver instead of my personal email. So I can truly see what it looks like with sales support, my personal email.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So the idea that we want to have is for you to have in just one window, it's not distinct windows, one window, very distinct portions in that one tab which is inbox, just the emails assigned to you. And then sales support. And maybe the one, I saw that there was one more right now. So all of those in three distinct environments and no overlap, no spillover unless it's required and contextual, that's the way we want this to be set up. So you've got your sales support inbox, which is connected as yours for now. But once you connect sales support in there, and if you have any one or two more inboxes, they'll all exist as distinct stuff. And the core structure around which we've built it is keeping all of those distinct.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Okay. So once we're out of keeping, I want to make sure that I switch things over to sales support from my testing in my personal inbox, that I'm not getting any emails from sales support or they're supposed to go to sales support in my personal inbox. So all of my emails in my personal inbox should be going directly to me and me only. And then everything in the hiver testing inbox should just be from sales support.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That is, that's how it's intended. And if you'd like we can even like maybe even 15 minutes beginning of next week, whenever you're ready to make sure that happens, I can bring someone from my implementations team on and absolutely make certain that all the filters that we need are in place and where functioning is expected just so that we don't have to sort of reinvent… the wheel or anything like that. So, yeah, I'm happy to set that up.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Perfect.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  All right. So, I guess that's one takeaway I've made that anything else I can help with at this time in general feedback questions, things that you'd like to see maybe next week that I can come prep for. I'm happy to sort of learn all about that. But yeah, let me know.

Mikes1410:
  Excellent.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Nothing I could think of right now. Are you nevermind no, nevermind?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Go ahead you want.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  To say, Mike, I'm sorry, what were you going to say?

Mikes1410:
  I was going to ask you if you had any other questions?

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Other than I was, I guess I was just going to ask to see like, are you able to show us how like an Asana integration would work like on a ticket?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Give me a sec. So the way hiver's Asana integration is meant to do. And I think we discussed it briefly, last call as well, which is we're meant to be a bridge, right? And bridge works both ways. So, for example, if an email comes in from Karen for example, and this email from Karen has a task already assigned to it in Asana, that task would be visible in a card like this. So I've got a Salesforce card. I've got a Netsuite card. Similarly, you would have an Asana card. That is one, secondly, what you can do is, so essentially things happening connected to this email on Asana will be visible next to it. So all updates from Asana will be coming in real time. Secondly, what you can do is say there is no task associated with this email, you read this email. And when you're reading it, you realize that, hey, I have to create a task for my team in Asana regarding or linked to this email. I simply click on the apps button, click on this, create new object button, and then you create the object to set up. So here, I can create a task in Asana task in anything, clickup any other products, cards, bills, leads, deals across as you can tell, you can do things in the CRM, you can do things in your billing system, you can do things in your project management system. So you asked about Asana. So I'm going to click on task in Asana, I'm going to say quavered… task, I'm going to select my workspace. And then once I select my workspace, it's going to pull all your project information from Asana. So I'm going to say sales onboarding and forecasting, and then it's going to pull all the other subfolders from Asana as well. So I'm going to say sales forecasting, I'm going to select who the assignee can be. So all my assignees in Asana will be visible here. So I'm going to say, Manoj I'm going to set a due date for it as end of the month. And I'm going to click create. And if you need, like I said, if you need any fields, you can always let us know, and from that point on that task like this exists here and this task is clickable and that opens straight in Asana. So yeah. So once it's created, and once it's connected, we want this to be like a two way bridge.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Awesome. That sounds fantastic. Another… thing that I'm curious about is, so I noticed that there is a, an… option to, and I'm sorry, I took screenshots of what I found. So, we… have a sending there's, a sending pending option. So,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  When.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  it's in pending, is that, is there a way to, and we probably discussed this in our first meeting and I apologize but, is there a way to set up something to where after a few days, it goes back to open, our team.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  And then possibly because I think this can be done in Zendesk, a third party or we're waiting on something from the customer. So we close it as pending. And then if the customer doesn't respond within a few days, can something be sent out as a reminder to the customer of, hey, we're still waiting on a response from this kind of thing? Can you please, you know?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. We can definitely help you set that up. So the way that would work is you create a workflow or what we'd call an automation where it says, hey, if an email comes in. So the way this works firstly is in your homepage, unassigned, mine and team, they only contain open email. So when they're when something is open, it's in those three sections. The second you feel like, hey, with this reply, I have nothing more to do until I wait for a response from the customer. In those scenarios, you'd mark it, send and pending and you'd move on. What that does is it takes it out of your mine folder and your pending folder and it stays in, sorry, mine and team. So it's no longer open. So it's no longer in mine and team over here because if you notice any emails that are in mine or team are only in open, right? So second, it goes into this pending folder. There is a number next to it. So you know exactly at any time, how many emails are in there. And you can also see who is assigned to right now. When there are so many emails here that are in pending. What you want to do is you want to be able to set up a workflow that says, if an email comes in, I'm just going to jump into the workflows very quickly. We'll create from scratch. So when status is updated and if condition is, status… is no, sorry. Yeah, time passed since no external reply is received right now. You want to say, let's say you want to say 48 hours, then you can automatically create an action to update the status to bring it back to open. And you can send an actual email to that in that particular scenario.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Fantastic.

Mikes1410:
  Yeah. We have a bump solve automation in Zendesk which gets a lot of use, but that was not something that could be facilitated in keeping. So that was another frustration that we had. So that's great that it's and I got to say I really love the interface fields automations. Having it like a flow chart is just makes a lot of sense to me makes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  A lot of sense. And honestly, we've had the reason why we adopted this UI especially in the last six months is we've actually got, we want this to be able to do all sorts of things in the last six months like so, which is why we've got an AI node here already so you can ask hiver to read the email or AI to process it. And based on the results of the processing, the results of the processing could be getting a like a gist of the ticket of the ticket or it could be extracting a particular data point out of the email and using that you want to trigger some things that's why we've taken this UI approach because we want that to be really flexible and ubiquitous with whatever we do.

Mikes1410:
  Yeah. So Maya, if they were like top line data points we needed before prepping an order, we could have the AI pull that out into a summary. It could also tell us if those data points are missing potentially like we tell it to always look for a po. And if there's not a po to throw a, you know, hey, there's no po attached here or whatever.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me just show you an example of what that might look like. Okay? So there might be a ticket summary here that gets automatically filled out. Let me just go in and, yeah… there we go. So this is a ticket summary that gets automatically filled in by our AI. So it says description renewal for this particular drug priority not specified and that comes in here. So these are all things that you can do with our AI. So it extracts it summarizes it reads context.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Awesome.

Mikes1410:
  Very cool. Yeah, I don't have any other questions right now. I think next week is going to be the crucial testing time for us once we get disentangled from keeping and Maya can really spend some time in hiver that'll be great. But yeah, I mean, you know, we love what we're seeing from the platform so far. So I'm very excited to talk more about it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we definitely want to support you as we go through this evaluation. So in terms of next steps, I'll wait for you to finish up with keeping this week, Maya, would you want to meet, you, tell me what's better, Monday or Tuesday next week?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Not for our full discussion, maybe just to meet to get the setup right and make sure that what you want to see in front of you is what you're seeing. And I'll have someone from my implementation team available as well. So Monday, Tuesday, you let me know what works better, and then I'll have an invite sent out.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Awesome. I'm available… all day, Tuesday or Monday. So why don't we just get that started right off the bat so I can have everything set up and ready to go for the entire week.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sounds good. So Monday same time?

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Sure. Yeah.

Mikes1410:
  Yeah, sounds good.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So I'm just going to send the invite over now, sync and set up. And I've also included a member, a pretty senior member of our implementations team who's been at the company for a long time. So send that invite over for Monday. And if there's anything else that comes up in the meanwhile, let me know.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Sounds good.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. And you should also once you refresh your screen, you should also see that the trial's been extended.

Miah Bond (miahbond@quavermusic.com):
  Perfect. Thank you so much.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Thanks for your time on the top right of your screen. You'll see that under the hiver settings button, there's instant chat support. So if you have any quick, you want quick answers to any of your questions, you can always reach out to my chat support team. They're available. Wait times of less than one minute on chat, so there you can reach out to them as well. Lovely. Perfect. Thanks. Speak to you on Monday. Thanks everyone. Bye bye. Have a great weekend. You too. Bye bye.
