Tomi Lawal (tomi@mubi.com):
  hello?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi, thank you for joining in, Tomi, how are you doing?

Tomi Lawal (tomi@mubi.com):
  Good. Thank you yourself. Very.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Well, thank you. Thank you for asking. All right. So, yeah, I wanted to have a quick discussion around where do we stand in terms of evaluation? You said your teammates were out a couple of days ago. So, yeah, and we got rescheduled and I believe you were also scheduled to talk to Zendesk folks?

Tomi Lawal (tomi@mubi.com):
  Yes. So, I've had a little bit of luck, not as much as I'd like just because a couple of team members were off. So it was a little busier. But so far at the moment, Iva seems to do what we want. And that's what we're leaning towards Iva, I still need to get to sort of run it by my manager and then kind of get a decision from him as well. But so far, in terms of my own exploration of Zendesk and Iva and sort of the offerings, Iva, seems to be a lot more applicable to us. Great. Yeah, that's where I'm at the moment.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Thank you for the feedback. Okay. Fair enough. I get it. Now, when are you going to talk to your boss? I mean, what timelines are we looking at?

Tomi Lawal (tomi@mubi.com):
  I'm not sure yet. So I wanted to sort of just take it away and then come back to you when I have more of a better idea of where we can go from there. It's a little busier with the end of the year coming up now and just a lot of things are going on. So it may not be something that we actually implement right away. Okay? But yeah. So my thought was to go away when we do make a decision, then I can come back to you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Would that be like a project for next year now? I mean, if I get that, right?

Tomi Lawal (tomi@mubi.com):
  Potentially, yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you want me to get in touch with you towards the end of December, if that makes sense? Or would we want to keep it for December? I mean, January conversation?

Tomi Lawal (tomi@mubi.com):
  Yeah, I could, let me just come back to you when we're ready. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. No worries at all. I mean, I get that. Let me drop you a thank you email note so that you have my contact details. All right. And for now, I'm going to be closing the loop and you could feel free to write back to me whenever you're ready. We'll take it up right from there.

Tomi Lawal (tomi@mubi.com):
  Okay. All right. Sounds good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is there anything else that I can be of help to you today?

Tomi Lawal (tomi@mubi.com):
  No, nothing else. Thank you so much. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. Well, thank you so much for your time, Tomi, and whenever it's a good time, feel free to reach back. I'll drop a quick note to you on an email.

Tomi Lawal (tomi@mubi.com):
  All right. Sounds good. Thank you. Bye bye bye.
