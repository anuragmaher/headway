Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, William. Good morning.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Hello, hakesh. That's your name.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's right. Nice to meet you.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Nice to meet you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Thank you for joining in. Let me quickly introduce myself. I'm Rakesh and I take care of sales at hiver for the european territory. So I'll be your point of contact today to run the show. Of course, we'll go through your requirements, look at how you've been using Zendesk today. What are those challenges that you did discuss with my colleague Shalini? We'll go over all of those challenges. And towards the end of the discussion, we'll figure out if this is a good solution for your team.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Okay. Thank you so much, lovely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, I've been with the company for over four years, have personally onboarded more than 500 teams, so many teams that have already migrated from Zendesk. So you're in safe hands, you can ask me a number of questions as many as you have. And then we will discuss if I could make this job for you even more easier to look at a better solution than Zendesk.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Okay. Perfect. That's a thing.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So we'll begin with William. Do you want to first of all, tell me what's your personal motivation on looking for a solution for bamboo payment? Since you're already using Zendesk. But what led you to look at a new solution today?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  First things first. I mean, Zendesk is a very expensive tool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  That's, very, expensive. We are not getting, we're not using the full capacity of Zendesk. I know it's a powerful tool but it requires like literally a consultant or assistant administrator to set up everything and everything like you need to integrate. I see very, not so intuitive. You know, I mean, we are looking for a tool that allows automation… a connection with our process documentation, internal documentation, connections… with other workflows, automations… and what else could I say? AI powered? I mean, even though we pay a lot for Zendesk, if you want, we want to use AI, you have to pay more. They sell everything like more. And I see like there are other tools that already have this like by default now in the industry, like they are already based on AI. It's not something like, oh, it's net on that you need to purchase. So basically, we have issues with Zendesk. It's small issues and it's so hard to configure and find the right this week. We had to solve a problem that replies with attachments. When we're going directly to spam of our customers. It was a whole, I had, I request support by Zendesk. They only asking me questions, then I went to chatgpt, how to solve that problem in Zendesk. In 30 minutes. Chatgpt helped me to solve the problem that the support team of Zendesk. Of course, we're not a big account for them and we don't have like a consultant account manager showing us what to do, but I mean, we want a solution that's simple AI powered connect with documentation, allows automations and what else? Allow us like KPIs… to mount a dashboard on Zendesk. It's also complicated. I mean, they have a lot of products but it requires you to be two and four seven a day doing things there to get it working. And we want a good solution but in a simplified way to operate because we don't have a bigger team. And also, we don't have like a person that could dedicate it full time to developing stuff and, you know, understood like a customer portal in Zendesk for you to have a customer portal, you have to program it literally with, you know, I mean, it's that way.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Yeah. I mean, William, whatever you have told me until now, I completely resonate with it. These are the issues we hear almost every day from Zendesk customers. Unless the teams are super technical, they don't require assistance and their use cases involve complicated use cases, you know, a dedicated setup where engineers don't require assistance, although you're right? Zendesk is an amazing product. But sometimes for customer facing teams, think about finance teams, HR teams. These solutions can become challenging in nature to learn. You don't really need additional user to kind of keep them trained on the solution. And even if they need some changes in it, you would again need to get back to the companies which is not ideal and scalable. So I completely get it. And these are the challenges I hear about the solution like Zendesk and just not Zendesk, you know, even solutions like Freshdesk. Even the other folks who are there in the marketplace provides excellent solution, but still are not very easy to use. They're not offering a zero learning curve.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, can I understand a little bit more about your team? And with respect to Zendesk, are you in an annual contract with them? How much are you paying to them? Just out of curiosity, even like you said, AI is expensive, how much are you paying to these folks?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  For Zendesk, around 12,000 dollars a year?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And for how many people?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  For 10 people?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you're paying almost 100 dollars a user?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Yes, I see. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if it's eight or 10. It's been in between, you know, that's the average number. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Which is still, you know, 100 100, 1,000 dollars a month for about eight to 10 people. Team is still at pretty much higher cost. I can certainly feel it. Okay. And does that not include the AI? I believe AI is extra, no.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And when is your Zendesk contract expiring?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  May may 27, 26. Sorry.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, you still have six months left with Zendesk. Are you looking to move out of Zendesk before that? Because I'm not sure if you will get any refund or would you wait until may and then implement a new solution? Where do we currently stand with respect to making a decision today?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  No, we are… for you to understand we are starting the research tools, researching tools now, Hiver came up, and, we also are researching other tools. The plan is in March. So we want to plan this migration. Have all our databases migrated to a new tool in March, launch it in April. We don't want to expect until may to, okay, let's end our contract and then start a new tool. No, we want to anticipate everything in March, end of March. Have everything migrated, start April running on the new tool? Then in may, when the contract ends, we are not on Zendesk anymore… that, that's the plan. It's done basically very good. Have everything done? Have everything done by March?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear, very clear. Thank you. I've made a note of it. And you said you're also looking at a couple of other players out in the market. Could you tell me who all, have you already explored other than hiver?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Helpscout.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Pylon?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sorry. What was the second one?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Pylon? I don't know if you've ever heard of it. Let me, let me write. I write down pylon B to B.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  How do we spell that? I mean, oh, pylon B to B. Okay. I've not heard them so much.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  It's not, it is not a, and let me write everything now. It's helpscout. The guys from helpscout told me that the founder of helpscout. This is really funny. He decided to found helpscout because he tried to configure Zendesk and he couldn't and then he decided to found helpscout. Basically, that's the story. I see. Yes, that's pylon. I would say about pylon. It's not, it's not actually a, how could I say that? It's not like a ticketing system. It is more integrated channels too like Jira, you can integrate everything there and you manage by issue like, you have a… it's like issue going on that has an email related and maybe a Zendesk ticket, you can integrate everything in pylon. I know of pylon because of one of our customers, they were so upset with Zendesk that they immigrated to pylon basically, and they told us because, we were also having problems with Zendesk. And they were asking us questions, how are you solving this with Zendesk? And we are like, we don't know and they, okay, they tried to find someone to solve their Zendesk issues. They couldn't find anyone. And then they left Zendesk and went to pylon. Basically, I see.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. All right. And who all who else?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  That's only the tools we are in mind for now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. Fair enough. Now, with regards to your current setup on Zendesk, you said you require automation workflows, number two, you require an integration with make. Com?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Yes, I will tell you about it. We have a, we are a payments processing company, like the local E banks, maybe austropay, all these companies stripe, whatever. We also provide a service like them like this, a payment facilitator, we call it payfac. And, you know, in the payments… world, there is a chargeback that happens all the time and this chargeback process currently is running through automation. It goes through Zendesk to make and then fulfills a spreadsheet, everything. And this allows the process to be scalable. You know, like they don't have, they don't need to have, I mean, 10 people handling chargebacks because this automation helps them. I don't know if make could, you know, make it directly to Gmail. I'm not sure about it. But the thing like Zendesk is it's in the middle of this process and that would require like there are next two also would allow, this connection with make, you know, basically. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, so you're saying this process has already started with Zendesk internally or you're in the middle of developing it?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  No, it's already done like it's the most. It's the, to be fair, it's the only automation thing we use regarding connecting it with Zendesk. But it's not a Zendesk automation. It's like a connection with make that works with Zendesk, you know? So you,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  want to show me the exact connection and the exact workflow. Let me quickly.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  See. I don't have, that access. In fact, let me see if I have it. I don't have it. So because it's not my team that handles it. Let me try, to log into it. Let me see if I have it. I don't even have access to making this. No, I don't have access. It's it's the chargeback. It's a fraud prevention team that has access. Okay. But yeah, I could ask.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Them, we can discuss this even, you know, with one of my implementation engineers, I could, we could probably set up another meeting and discuss this in very specifics as to how exactly we are doing it today versus how do you want this to be managed in hiver? So that we have clear workaround around it? We could see how exactly it is done. Okay? But today, I do want to spend some more time to first of all, show you how hiver functions. Okay? Check it through the exact workflow. I see that you signed up for a trial but you did not complete it. You never added any sort of shared mailbox. So you must not even have gone through, the setup as such.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  No, I set up in my personal email account. The thing, we have a shared email box. And I was, I just didn't want to put any more connection to Gmail. Like because Zendesk is connected to it. I was afraid of messing up, but basically, it was that but I tried the interface. I know it's one question. It's only work in Gmail or you have like, a interface that can be separated from Gmail, for example? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We do have, so that's a very good timing by the way William, we already have an interface launched which will be a web interface. You can connect, your Gmail shared mailbox, the actual common inbox for the team into that interface. And I will show that to you. Okay? I'll show you both of it by the way. You must have seen the Gmail interface, but I'll show you exactly where my customers are today logging in and, you know, looking into these requests. Okay? So this is the Gmail interface. You must have seen that everybody logging into their individual Gmail accounts run hybrid?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Extension. And.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  manage. Yeah, this is right inside Gmail. What I'm now talking about is an interface which is, let me show you. Okay. So this is going to be app hiverhq. So this is the web interface, and from here, you would still have your personal emails on the top. Okay? It will take another minute to load.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Can I see it even with my free account trial?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  For this setup like the web interface setup?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Yes or not?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  At the moment, it is in a beta testing phase, but for about 10 days because you're on Gmail, if you were on outlook, Microsoft, I would have held you set it up right now. So this is already out for the outlook customers, the Gmail customers, some customers are actually moving out of our Gmail interface and they want to go to the actual app interface, which is a web browser interface. So you'll be able to set it up in less than 10 days. So by end of this month, November, we are launching that you'll be able to set up your Gmail mailboxes inside this folder, inside this application.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  And by the way, I love it because it's so simple it's minimal. That's why I like the most.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. You see the conversations on the top, your personal emails here, your HR support emails here, your new requests in the unassigned, if you assign email to yourself, it is a part of mine. You open the request, look at what it is about, look at the summary of the email. It tells you what is it exactly about? Then from here, you could just go ahead, assign emails to your colleagues. You tag the emails, whatever the email is about, you know, the priority. All of these are the custom fields, whatever the shipping stage. I mean, these are the custom fields. You can choose to use your sort of custom, you know, dropdowns, you can drop each other, the notes and comments, talk to your colleagues. And that's how you could talk to each other. All of that. Once you're done with the ticket resolution, you close it, all, the closed email goes to the closed bucket. So that's a, very simple interface that you're looking at. So these are where all the closed emails are all about. And in order to reply again, is very simple, you open the email, look at the context reply, right? From here, your replies can go from your personal email or the support mailbox, email. Whatever that common inbox is, you can have your signatures at the bottom. You can use the customer satisfaction service snippet at the bottom of the email. It could be automated. Also, these are the AI composed where hiver can help you compose those emails and everything. If you're required to save the draft and share it with your team. Well, let's say Rakesh is a new person, but I don't know if this is a good response. I can save the draft. I can add, mention my other colleagues in the team, they can make sure that they edit the draft, make changes, choose the ownership and send the customer an email. This is an SLA running, right? What is the first response and resolution time? This all can be set up by the way at the backend. All, and for you in the analytics, you can run reports and look at whatever is happening in your inbox, how many emails coming in open, pending, close, how long we take to resolve these emails and everything, right? In the analytics section, I think it's my internet at the end of the day. But yeah, let me show you the analytics one.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  I saw the analytics, don't worry about it. I saw how it works. Okay. One thing in gendesk, we have a setting called brands. What that means? I have a support brand. I have a fraud prevention brand and I have a technical account management team brand, which means each team they have a separated. How could I say you divided gendesk in teams? You know, okay, would that be possible in hiver?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  In hiver, we straight off go ahead and create these mailboxes. And when we create these mailboxes, we choose the email account for these brands. Like I say, this is team inbox at the rate brand, a right? Dot com. And then of course, with setup instead of outlook, you would also get an option to select the Gmail, if it is a Google account, if it's a user account, it's a distribution list, and then you will be able to create these mailboxes. So basically, with hiver, what you're doing is we are helping you create these separate mailboxes for these brands.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Okay. So what gendesk call brands, you call it email box. So I can have an email box for chargebacks, an email box for fraud prevention for support. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, that's right? So these brands could be the different mailboxes in hiver setup here. Yes. And this remains exactly the same under the brands. You have different email for the different customers for different categories, then you can classify these under different folders, right? These are the billing emails. These are escalation emails. That is all possible. You automatically tag those emails, you create the workflows and everything so that all is possible.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And with regards to the integrations, like you said, you use Jira. So we have a native integration with Jira, if you notice us now. So, yeah, this is a direct integration with Jira, and this basically helps you look at the Jira cards, right? From the email. For an example. Let me pick this up and see if I have. Okay… I opened this one up. I look at the apps, and from here, I could see the Jira content here. So this is Netsuite. Okay? This is Pipedrive. Okay? Let's not talk about this. Let me see if I could show you. Yeah, create a Jira ticket summary, and then it pulls up all of the relevant information without logging into Jira interface altogether.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Oh, that's awesome. I love it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So that's automatically possible by the way. And with regards to our existing workflow for the chargebacks, we would love to learn more because we can do even the custom integrations for you guys from the admin panel. If I could find any app which is not available, we can always look at the new app request. And this could be, yes, I.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Requested already when I had the option, basically, it's a connection through make… that's it. I mean, if you have make connection, I think they can.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  See this.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  For sure, it will happen. Other things I would like to ask confluence, is there a connection to confluence?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Confluence? Let me check that. Yeah, we can request an app for the confluence. Also, we can get this built. Not immediately. We don't have it readily available, but this is an option that we can always explore because it's available here.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Okay. Just let me show you one thing. Sure. It's a brand new thing that atlassian has. Maybe in the future you have this connection, it's not something like in your, can I share my screen a little bit?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Please. Go ahead.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Video. We… don't use a.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  There's a green option at the bottom of the email that says share screen, so you can share it on the zoom panel.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  More record. No, I'm not, I am not seeing it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  A green button at the bottom of your zoom that says share screen.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Ah, no, yes. It's in the middle. How didn't I see it? Okay. Look at it. Atlassian atlassian, I don't know the name of this company. Yeah, they just launched a rovo that's like a chat, tpt, you know, Embedded with your, if you have like a process documentated, you can ask rovo. Okay. I will make a question for it. Let's see if my internet helps. How can I set up an user in verve? Verve is one admin panel we're developing and it would tell me based on the documentation I wrote, it will tell me, how can I set up a user in there? And maybe it's not something like we are looking for it. We are more worried about confluence… and Jira connection than rovo. But in the future, I think that this rovo connection will allow people to make… a.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  William, I can literally follow you. I understand what you've done here. We absolutely can do that. We call it co pilot in hiver, where you can upload the knowledge sources. Hiver will go through those knowledge sources and help your agents draft replies automatically. So that is possible with hiver, absolutely.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Mainly, I mean, it's good for helping the closed tickets. I don't know if I'm not sharing this, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, it is absolutely.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  But also not only for replying tickets but also for onboarding new people in the team.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. So if you notice hiver, AI ask AI and knowledge sources, you simply upload the different knowledge sources that you have, all the help documents and in hiver, even if you are internally onboarding customers or users or these are tickets which are for your customers. When you're looking into the conversations, you should be able to go ahead and ask AI to help you with the draft responses.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Oh, nice.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  What do you want to ask them? And you can just simply go ahead and do all of that? Yeah.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Okay. No, that's it. No, that's it… well, my, so for you to understand from my side, that is the support team that's all we need, AI connection, AI, confluence Jira connection, but there's the other side that requires this make connection. And, and then I know it's totally possible because you guys are genius in doing that. But I know it wouldn't be a problem to put this together. And well, basically that, so now,

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  let… me think we might, we will use this web interface, you know, I don't know can both be used at the same time or not. Do you have to choose one or not another?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, we need to choose one to be able to coordinate internally. Like there will be a better collaboration. We can't have some people just on Gmail, you know, login. And then someone in hiver interface on web, I would say everybody has to be either on one or on the second, yes.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  That's it. If it was only my team, I would say, okay, let's be on Gmail, but I think the web interface is, so, I love it.

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  When I saw it on the site, I knew it wasn't available for testing, but, Yes. Now, I think, the information we need is cost, how cost it is, how much it's going to cost. The main difference between the plans, I know you have the growth plan, The premium, the top premium. So basically, that's the, what we need to understand better sure. And I know that we will have support from you from developing things not like got it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, even from the pricing standpoint, I can help you save as much as possible. Of course, we have got growth plan, pro plan and elite plan. Anything to do with the customization of the plans or maybe, you know, when we want to custom build certain applications for you, we are looking at the elite license. Now, this is for your reference. By the way. This is a 75 dollars per login, but we can always look into the best discounts possible. Okay? Within this plan, I can give you the AI as well. Now, if you notice we have AI add on for about just 20 dollars per login. Okay. This is hiver, AI add on where it can help you automatically do the co, pilot thing, tagging, sentiment analysis, exact answers and everything. So this is essentially 20 extra dollars. So that will be around 20 plus 75, almost 95 dollars. But as and when we are more closer towards the evaluation, I can always make this the best deal for you. Okay. This is just for your reference, by the way, and it covers everything that you require. You can have your 10 agents. So that's going to be 75 multiplied by 10, 750. And then I could see if I could make this maybe around, you know, 60 dollars and 15 dollars for the AI, making it 75 all in all. So you could always say around eight to 9,000 a month instead of 1,215,000 that you're already paying. So we can always look into the best discounts again. I'm not worried about the commercials here. We are flexible to look at into it. What I really want is first of all to make sure when we have the hiver web browser available for Gmail customers. I want to personally reach out to you so that I can set you up on the test account and you test the solution, you bring a couple of your folks, and we understand your different use cases and you try the product out. Once you say that after trying, we are happy, we are very much committed to recommend solution internally to your team. And your management wants to finally look at the commercials. I promise this is the easiest part to deal with. Okay?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Okay. So that's good. That's basically what we need. We need support and I know things are going to work out. And for everyone, I spoke to you guys gave the best presentation… one feedback. If I may, you are not trying to push, you know, buy hiver, we are the best, you already have the product. It's there. You know, you're not trying to push and that's very nice because you're more preoccupied with how it's going to work than.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely, William, towards the end of the day, my main goal is to assist you finding the right solution because you're already in trouble with the existing contract with Zendesk. It's not working out well for you, right? I don't want to sell you anything for sure. I want to help you solve the problem. If you're looking to move out. Absolutely, we can wait until the subscription is there with the Zendesk even if it is needed, right? Let's say, William, you happen to like the product in the month of January itself. We can look into the buyback contract. Also, we can maybe, you know, do some more discounts, let it be with Zendesk as it is. We can help you start for, you know, one or two months for free of cost. So that we accumulate, I mean, we accommodate the cost and we kind of help you buy back the purchase as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All I want to make sure first of all is that it works for you that you're looking at a solution which is good enough for you first of all?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  No, thank you so much. And also a last question I have, I don't want to take your time mark. Is there a way for us to move our database of customers and organizations with the information we have to hiver and have all this set up at the onboarding process?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. I have actually migrated a number of customers from Zendesk into hiver at the end of the day, it totally depends upon what exactly is the database that we're looking to move? If it is the customer information, the company?

William Westphal (wwestphal@bamboopayment.com):
  Yeah, a customer with organization, you… know, like the customer, I don't know, Maria from adt company, la or Maria from walmart. So we have this database and set up the, how could I say the tiers for an organization? All of this. So basically it's perfect. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I have got the entire importing Zendesk data into hiver, how the migration would look like and everything. I think it is not going to be a challenge at all. I can maybe share a help document with you. This is like the overview of how the migration would work, export your data from Zendesk, whatever the XML file that you have, the tickets would appear in hiver, what are the different limitations and all of that? So you have everything possible by the way, no, perfect from the contacts, yeah, emails, attachments, notes, attachment, and notes, maintaining the entire thread of those emails in hiver. Even if these were the tickets from Zendesk conversations, what will not import is the group and organizations, different groups. But anyways, when we are going to be setting these different brands in hiver as a shared mailboxes, those will be the groups by default. So all of that is possible.

  No, for sure. We make it as smooth as possible.

  And that's why we are trying to anticipate we don't want to do things like we are not in April, we need to migrate it. So we don't want to rush. So we want to do very things like this. So, hagesh, thanks so much for your time and we keep in touch when the absolutely William thank you so very much for your time. Also, I would have loved to put a meeting on our calendar for about a couple of more weeks from now for sure because I do not have a definite timeline in my mind as to when this will be launched. So, can I go ahead and propose maybe we reconnect in about two weeks from now for sure. Yes, please. Please. Okay. Then I'm proposing. Yeah, the first of November, yes, or maybe the same time if that's okay with you? Yes, it's perfect. I mean, I love it. I personally, I love the Gmail solution, but I think that the web interface will, I will help to sell more internally. It won't be a restricted interface for everybody in the team because I understand your team is used to work in Zendesk interface, which is not restricted to Gmail. So it is always fine to keep your Gmail separate than your ticketing module, which is why we have web interface already available for our outlook customers. For Gmail. It'll be super soon available. And I'll be the first person to contact you from hiver when it is launched. So we can help you test it as well. For now, let me send you an invite for Twitter first to reconnect. Again. Perfect. I've sent you an invite already so… I can see… yes, I just accept it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. And what I would do is at the end of the call, if you want, I can send you the recording of our conversation if you want to go through it or maybe review this internally. Otherwise, if you have any more questions, we are going to be connected, feel free to write back to me and we'll be in touch with you towards the 20 first of this month for sure. Thank you so much, Vikesh. All right. You're very welcome. You take care. Bye bye, bye bye.
