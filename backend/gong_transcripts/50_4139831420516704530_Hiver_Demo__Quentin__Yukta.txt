  My level in English is very basic.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'm so sorry, I did not understand what you said. Could you repeat it please?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  My level in English language is so bad.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  They would raise your last name, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Could you repeat that? Maybe?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Yes, my… level in English is a little bad in English language.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  my level, I'm not able to understand. I'm so sorry?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  My English level is low.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. You're saying that you are not very comfortable with English?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Are you able to understand what I am saying?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  OK. So, can we continue in English? Or would it be difficult for you?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  French? It's… possible, but if not possible, English, it's OK.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I wouldn't be able to speak in French. So, unfortunately, we will have to continue… in English. I will try to be as slow as possible and you can let me know whenever you're not able to understand me, so that I can repeat myself?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Yes. In English, in English, it's OK, for the presentation?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Perfect. Then. Quintin, could you just help me understand what you are looking for?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  are you comfortable talking in English or are you more comfortable listening and understanding it? Yes.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  English. It's okay for listing presentation, however, but it's difficult for me to speak… in group, okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, let me do this. Let me give you the presentation or an introduction of high word, and then with, from there, you can check if this is the tool that you would want to use. Will that work? Yes?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  For… my team needs email management, just email management… and dispatch, task… attribution, task management and email management.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Understood. And how many people do we have in this team?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  It's a little team in first time, three… people but four and five maximum people.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So we sell in bucket of five. So, the minimum users that you would be looking at is five to start using hyper. Okay, I think let me share my screen and I can show you how the platform works for managing your emails. Yes.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let me share my screen and let me, yes, yes.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  It's okay. You?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can see, right? Yes.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, Quentin hiber, I see that you have also started the trial. So, do you have any specific email address that you would like to manage between these three to five people?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Email address?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Like which email address do you want to manage?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  One email address, my teams use, one share mailbox.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  OK. So is, this one that you have added here? The Jimi Hendrix?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Yes, it's a share mailbox test. Yeah. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And you have added Jimmy, Mikhail and yourself, right? So do you want to create the shared mailboxes on this email address or some other email address?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  It's the same… odoo, FR, is… alias of… yes, Jimmy got it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No problem. Let me just give you the overview since you have already made a test account. So I can show you how the platform works and will help you managing the emails. And then later, you can add any email like you have added this one, likewise, whichever email you want to handle, you can just add that as the shared mailbox? Okay?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So in hiver, as you can see, you log into your Gmail account which you have today and you can create the shared inbox, which will be connected to the email address that you would like to manage between multiple people, right? So let's say, I take an example of the support inbox here. So what will happen? All the new emails will start coming into this unassigned section, which will mean that these are the emails which are new that nobody has started working on. And from there, when you pick any email from this activity section, on the right, you will be able to assign this email to the right person in your team. So let's say I assign this to myself and all the emails that are assigned to you will be coming into this mind section. So from here, you can manage all the emails that are assigned to you. And for all three to five of, you can go into the team section here and you will be able to see all the emails here that are assigned between, you know, each one of you, so that you have the transparency as to who is handling what. So, for example, if let's say Cole has two emails. And if I want to understand what is happening or if I want to reassign this to myself, I can just easily do that and take this from here, right? And all the activities that you do in hiver, everything gets recorded. So you would know who is making, what changes, what are the tags that we are applying here? And other things as well. Does it make sense? Or am I going too fast? It's.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  okay. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So after the assignment, you also have tags here which will help you categorizing your emails into different tags. So as per what you need, you can create these tags for yourself. This can be in French. So, although all these buttons that you see like status or these ones, they will remain in English, but you can create your tags… in French as well and create a repository. So basically in the tags, then you can go in one topic and you can see all the emails related to that topic itself. So the tags can be helpful as well. And then when you are working on any email, you can reply to that, you can create email templates. This again can be in French. So that when you're replying to any email, you can just put this template here and send the response here. Or if you want to collaborate with your team members, you can come into this, add a note section and you can mention any of your colleagues and you can ask for an update, you can ask for their help or anything that you would want to do in order for you to be able to reply to this particular email. So as I have mentioned my colleague here, he will receive a notification in this bell icon, and we both can converse in regards to this particular email. And once I have gotten my answer, I am done here. I have replied to this email, I will come here and change the status from open to closed. So that now you will notice I only have five emails left that I need to work on. The closed email is now in the closed section in the all views wherein all your closed emails are sitting here. And if you get any response on any of these emails, they will come back into the mind section and will change the status on its own so that you don't miss anything in the closed section. So… this would be the basic workflow that you can use hiver for in order to collaborate better, making sure that you're not missing any emails on a day to day basis. And of course, then be able to assign track and all of that. Anything in specific that you want apart from this.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Excuse me… please repeat, please, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Like so far, what do you think? I mean, this is the basic workflow of the platform. Anything that you want me to show you that you are looking for apart from this?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Yes… it's possible to forward an email with.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  And assigned and email forwarding with the tenders?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Send as I lost.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  You. OK?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So are you saying that when you are assigning?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Yes, it's possible forward this email in the example. Yes, and does a shared mailbox, it's possible. Ivrltest. Com, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can choose to either reply from the shared email address, or you can reply from your own email address. If you want to reply from the shared email address, you just have to go to the Gmail settings and you will have to mark this email as the default email address. So, currently, my email address is on default. So you'll have to make this email address as the default email address, so that when you're replying automatically, it is catching this email.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  OK.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right. So you can use that. Is that what you were asking?

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Yes. In the first time, okay? And later… forwarding… one second. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Maybe you can type in French in gemini, translate it in English, and then send me on chat, then I can help.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  If you have any questions, just type all the questions in French and translate it to English and write it in the chat and I can then answer those for you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  let me see.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  In this mailbox, yes. Is the email visible to send item folder?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. It will be visible. I mean, here, you can see all the emails that are sent from your personal inbox and your shared inbox.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Okay. Is it visible in the, my send or all send?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  My send is basically the ones wherein you have yourself sent the response from the shared inbox. Only for the ones, the emails that are assigned to you. Okay. All send, is that all the emails that are being sent from the shared inbox, you will be able to see all of them here.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right. So I can see for my colleague also, matt, Rakesh, Alexander Raghav. So, for everyone, I can see here, and these emails will also be in your original inbox in the folder. So they will, you will not miss them. They will stay there only.

Quentin LEFÊVRE (quentin.lefevre@itsap.com):
  Okay. It's it's clear.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Great. Perfect. Anything else that I can help you with? In terms of the pricing?
