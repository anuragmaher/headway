================================================================================

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  what's hot.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi there, hi, Oli. How are you?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Very well. Thanks. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you so much. Shall we get started with the discussion? Yeah, for sure.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  No, we're good.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cool. Then let's get started. Let me just quickly introduce myself. My name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver, as well as your point of contact. I'll be the one helping you with the evaluation today. I know you booked the demo with us. So Oli, to start with, I would want to first understand what exactly you're looking to solve so that accordingly, I can tailor the demonstration today and make sure that we discuss on those points itself.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Right. Yeah, makes sense.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  So, yeah. So we're a benchmark startup. We've been going for about a year and a half team of about sort of full time team of sort of five and then part time team, sort of another five. We essentially have a platform that supports people to build and scale their own solopreneur business and AI consulting business specifically. So it's community. It's mentorship, it's learning it's business tools and you're growing sort of range of sort of services. We have many leads that come in and we speak to every single day across the team. And we're definitely getting to a point now where managing that and making sure that emails aren't missed and assigning tickets. And we just do it all through Gmail. And it's not really working anymore because of the scale. So certainly one of the needs and the problems that we're looking to solve is how we can better manage the emails that come in on the sales side, both to the group email, which is founders at, as well as our own individual emails of how we're messaging contacts, and we sort of want to be able to sort of be able to reply to an email that goes through the founders at, but they see it as Oli from stack or whatever, you know, that sort of unified inbox type stuff. And then the other part of it is… we, yeah, is we also have the founders and the AI consultants in our community and sort of the service, customer service founder success that we can offer them. Same idea. You know, we want to be able to better manage those, that email flow across the team. So yeah, those are kind of the two key things I think.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you mentioned you have a common email address which is founders at the rate.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Yeah. And we have a couple of others, we have onboarding app. We have a team app.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, you would want to manage all of these, so through hiver?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Ideally, yes. Yeah. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Or?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  At least a few of them. Yeah, we'd have to look at how that works. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, are these like group email addresses or do they have their own password? And then you all log into those and then pick the emails. How does it work?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  I believe… I think we've just set up email forwarding. So they're their own emails and then all those emails that go to them, get forwarded to the relevant members of the team.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So you have put the forwarding settings and these accounts, they have their own password, right? They are not.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Group emails.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I believe so. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Perfect. And all these collectively are managed by these 10 people that you mentioned, right? Yeah, to manage the workflow on a day to day basis. Got it. Yeah, I think hiver could help you managing these because forwarding emails to individual people. It does become sort of difficult to have full visibility onto how we are handling these emails and also tracking them in terms of how we are responding. And, you know, sort of closing them as well. Is this the first time? Olly, that you're looking out for a tool or have.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  you been? Yes. Yeah. No. First time. Well, I mean, we're looking to get a tool pretty quickly. So, but now is the first sort of time that we started the process.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Any specific trigger or anything happened that made you sort of look out for it?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  It's just the scale is getting larger and larger.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Cool. Let me just share my screen and I can show you how the platform looks and we can keep this interactive. If you have any questions, you can always interrupt in between. And then we can take it up. Perfect. So just a quick introduction. Olly hiver is a tool that works on top of your Gmail. So that you don't have to move out of Gmail that you usually use on a day to day basis. Now, how this works is you will just log into your individual account which I have done here. And we will embed hiver within your Gmail account itself. And we will create different shared mailboxes associated with these email addresses that your team is managing today, right? So as an example, I have finance healthcare project support. So likewise, we'll create one for founders onboarding. And likewise, and we'll add all relevant people so that now you don't have to rely on forwarding emails or getting emails into your individual inboxes and then deciding who needs to work on what rather you'll have a designated place wherein you'll have a shared mailbox. You will have all the people who needs to work on these emails. And this is how you will define your day to day workflow wherein you will have a designated section which is unassigned that will contain all brand new emails that are being written at this email address. And from there, you can assign those emails and give proper ownership as to who needs to work on it, right? So, for example, in the founders mailbox, you have five individuals be part of it. You'll see their name and faces, and you can assign the email to the right person. And with this, when you assign the email to everyone, when you're replying to any email, you still have that option to either reply from your own individual email address, or you can reply from the shared email address. So like you mentioned, you would still want to reply from your individual. So you can still maintain that and reply from your personal email address to maintain the personalization here on the emails. And once you assign email, this will be shown in the mind section, so that the mind section will show indicate as to these are the emails that are assigned to me right now. And I need to work on. And for example, if I am part of multiple of such shared mailboxes, I don't necessarily have to go to each mind section and then look at my emails. I can just click on the assigns to me section here. And I'll know these are the emails across all the inboxes that I'm supposed to. Work on, so this would be the assignment here. Of course, from the scalability perspective, you would not want to always assign emails manually. So we can also sort of automate this whole process on the basis of certain keywords, certain domains that your team is working on. If you want to assign emails according to that, we can do that as well, right? And right below this, you would have your tag section which will help you categorizing these emails into different buckets, right? So, I'm sure you must be receiving emails on different topics, right? Or different concerns. So you can bucket those together in order to have a clear reference or an ease of reference, to create a repository for yourself wherein you can go into one section and pick all the emails related to that one individual topic. So it becomes a lot easier than skimming through or searching through different emails to rather have one category created and have all those emails be part of it in one place. Just taking a pause here a little quick if you have any questions or feedback so far?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  No. Interesting so far. Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. I'll move on then. So apart from these things, Olly, as you're working on any email, there are a couple of things you can do here as well. Right? Number one is your email templates. So you could, you know, put all the templates in one place, itself, create different folders as well for people to refer those templates rather easily. So if something is related to just onboarding, you can create one folder, have all templates related to onboarding. And whenever I'm working on any email, I can just get the right template here and it's good to go. I can still modify it and then I can send the reply right here. Right? Apart from this, we also have hiver AI that also helps your works with you in the form of ask AI here wherein it can help you sort of, you know, drafting a reply for you in case you want. So you can prompt a draft or reply. It'll read the message here or an email here and will give a response. Or you can ask anything here as well in order for you to be more efficient and help you getting to the responses quickly. So the ask AI is going to be working in personally for your company and what information you would want to feed it to learn itself on. So you can do that on the backend, put all the knowledge source or you can put some emails as well that could help AI to trade itself on. And you can use that in order to bring efficiency in your day to day workflow. Apart from this, I think last bit would be your internal communication. So as you can see, this activity section here is logging each and everything that you do, whether an automation is triggered, if somebody is assigning something to somebody else or anything that we do in hiver, everything gets recorded live because there are multiple people who are currently working out of this inbox, right? So, apart from this, if you're working on any email which is currently assigned to, you can easily collaborate with your teammate as well. So for example, if I still need to respond to this email and I can save this as a draft for a while as I don't have the clear answer and I can collaborate with anyone here and we both can converse in regards to this particular email. So that we don't have to forward it, mark each other in CC. Rather we both can converse right within this window while I'm getting my final response to be able to close this one here. So this is something that you could do. But internal notes is not just that somebody is inviting you that you only use that at that point. From a supervisor or a manager perspective point of view, I think this could also come handy when you go into the team section, and this is visible to everyone across the mailbox wherein you can still see for each individual person who is handling what today, so that if somebody is not available, if I need to pitch in for somebody else, let's say this is currently with Raghav. I need to let him know about something in regards to this email. I can put a note here that I showed you earlier. If let's say someone has a lot of open emails in their radar and they're not available for next couple of days. I can easily go ahead and reassign those to myself or anyone in the team so that we don't miss out on anything that is currently sitting in this mailbox. So, these are the couple of things that you can of course do and yeah, make sure that nothing slips through the crack. We are on top of all the emails at all time and manage a standard workflow as well. So this would be the basic workflow. Then last, it's just the status which is like open pending closed. So as you have worked on any email, you can just mark it closed so that it does not remain in your mind section. Anything apart from this that you're interested in, Olly, in terms of setting up certain slas analytics that comes to your mind?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  So you've shown me a little bit about how you can use the hiver codepilot. Are there flows where hiver can actually be the support agent in different ways? Is there sort of that chatbot functionality?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Support agent as in like, could you elaborate a bit more on that?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  So where the first someone emails in or contacts in the first response comes from an AI and it only escalates to a human's inbox if it's required.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, the deflecting feature where it could draft a response and probably reply on your behalf as well. So that is something which is not available at this point in hiver agents will have to involve and reply to these emails. But yes, with the copilot, it becomes easier for them to be able to draft a reply based on the email that is there and also ask anything based on what you have fed… from the backend. So here in the AI, if I just show you quickly in the admin panel… this is where your AI is and in the AI copilot in the knowledge source, this is where you can put your custom documents, anything that you would want AI to train itself on, right? You can also create a knowledge base with hiver that you could put as well. And while an agent is working on email, they can use this functionality in order to be more efficient. So this is something that we have in like, I think auto drafting of emails is something that will be coming up soon, but at this point, it's not supported.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Got it. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah… it's something that you're absolutely looking for or it's a good to have.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Maybe it's just, yeah, part of the mix that we're evaluating. And then I see down at the bottom right, connected apps. So what are some of the sort of integrations?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So we have a lot of integrations, any specific tool that you are looking for, so that I can, so.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  We use a slightly new CRM called atio, which isn't connected that much to many things yet. But we also use a lot of make com and zapier to make it work for us.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Atio. I have also used in one of my organizations that I've worked for. So I'm familiar with that tool, but I think currently, we don't have native integration with atio, but through zapier or through API, we could definitely achieve that because we do have with Salesforce or all the other CRMS that we have. So we could definitely create that connection. I'm assuming you would want to pull the records and be able to see it right here while you're working on any lead or any contact.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Yeah. I mean, the only thing is that atio does natively integrate with Gmail. So I'm assuming it'll just still be able to capture all the email progress. Hiver just lives on top of that, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I mean, likewise, you know, helpscout also connects natively with Gmail, right? So you might not have to, then in that case, connect it with hiver, right? Because anyway, you're using hiver on Gmail, so you can still fetch those details. So, yeah.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Anything else I should know about how this works?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think apart from this is last bit is just analytics in case you want to see certain metrics, how the inbox is performing on a monthly basis, get some reports on that, how the users are performing, what's our average response time? How much time are we taking? How the workload has been distributed across the team members, all these data or all these metrics are something that you could look at as well and get a view on, you know… within a specific time period?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Yeah, great. And then actually, yeah, I suppose that's the last thing let's talk about those sort of automations or those workflows. So whether it's sort of automatic assignment or automatic tagging or anything like that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So see, in terms of the tagging, there are two options, we can create a workflow for that. Also, we have AI auto tagging. So when you start marking, let's say billing to this email and you keep applying billing for like let's say initial 10 emails from the eleventh time onwards, AI tags gets trained on that and it starts automatically applying that tag for you. So that is one for the tags. Now, for the automations, there are many workflows that you can create for yourself. We'll take an example of a few. If you have anything in mind, I could actually replicate that as well right here and show you how that works.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  So I guess it would just be… I'm just trying to think how we would use it. So if someone replies to one of the group emails and replies using one of our individual's names, then that should automatically be assigned to that individual. Does that make sense?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It does.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  So if someone replies, so if someone had a call with us and we have like the founders at, is what we essentially use as sales at, if someone has an individual calls with us and then emails founders at saying, hi, Olly, it was great to chat. I still have some questions. I would want that email that goes into founders at, to automatically be assigned to me.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So if I understand this correctly, so founders at the rate is something that you're using for as a sales inbox.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So if, what we can do here in this case, when somebody is writing at founders at, obviously, if they want to connect with a specific person, they'll be mentioning that person's, name, right? Yes, exactly, they will be addressing them. So for that, what we can do is we can set up this condition. So this would be a trigger for us that any new email that comes into this inbox. And if it fulfills this condition, wherein in the body of the email there is, you know, your name is there, then it should get automatically assigned to you. So we can do that for sure.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, this is possible, likewise, we can, we'll have to just create this for each individual. Yes, that's going to be a one time activity for us, but yeah, we can absolutely do this.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Cool. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And not just this, you know, in the body or on the subject, if you have different keywords, you can do that as well trigger any action not just assigned to, but you can add tags as well, like I showed you so that automatically such tags gets applied, you can update status and do a lot of other things as well. While you are on, you know, we are at creating these workflows.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  I just saw an action send reply. So, what would that, what would you use that one for?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Send a reply is mostly used when let's say there is an email which has come in. It's mostly used for this use case wherein, you know, when you have a certain email sitting in pending, let's say you're awaiting a response from the other side, but you're not getting it and, it's been a, some, it's been some time that, you know, it has been sitting in that status. So for that, probably you would want to trigger a reply as a reminder to the customer to be able to respond to you. So this is what I'm currently doing if the status is let's say in pending and it's and you have not heard from the other side within 24 hours. You can send an automated response here and, you know, trigger that action.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So that is one scenario that you could use a send a reply option?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Right. Yeah, that makes sense.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yep.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Cool. Interesting.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So just a question, Olly, like when you mentioned you have different shared mailboxes, right? It could be founders onboarding. So these are different teams as well, or is it all part of the sales ecosystem?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  It's a bit of a mix. So that's kind of also what we're gonna have to figure out to try and sort of make it flow a lot smoother at the moment. Essentially whenever, so the sales team, one of them has a call with a potential lead prospect. They then send a follow up email and they CC founders at okay. And each time they reply to that lead, they CC founders at that means that everyone else in the sales team can see their emails going. Everyone's emails going to each lead.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So once you are, you know, moving to this scenario, you might not wanna then use your own personal email addresses in the?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Exactly. Yeah in.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Here, right? Because then you can easily assign and everybody can anyway see all these emails so we can change.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  So when someone replies who's part of the support inboxes you have here, say you were to reply to Karen or Steve, what does Karen or Steve see the email coming from? Does it see the email coming from your name at hiver? Or does it come just from support at hiver? Or what would it be?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can use either. So the first email has to just be addressed to the shared mailbox or the shared email address. So let's say this is support. So the first email will be written to support. And when I'm replying to the email, I can either reply back from support at the rate or I could use my individual email address as well. If I do that doesn't make sense for the recipient, he or she will see my email address only and not support anymore. And if that person replies back and not mention support, that does not change anything. This, it will still remain in the same thread. We can continue our conversation. So, yeah. Does that make sense?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Yeah. Okay. Perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Great.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  All right. I think that's it from my side need to go back and show the team some more and have a discussion and figure out sort of, yeah, our next steps from here.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let's do that. Would you want to connect for a feedback wherein you could let me know how you would like to proceed because we do offer a free trial as well, Oli, wherein you could set up at least one inbox, add a couple of folks so that you can see how it's working for you and then make a decision. How do you want to proceed from here? Yeah.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  I'll chat with sort of the team and then email about next steps, if that's okay. I'm just not quite sure how quickly or slowly you want to move forward?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Sort of do it from my side.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And would you mind sharing? Like who else is going to be involved here? I know that you're the one who's going to be, who's taking care of this, but in terms of internal law like.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  As in setting it up?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Yeah. So the CEO will be involved a little bit and then probably another one who does a lot of our integrations and we'll set up the connection with atio through zapier or otherwise and things like that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. But are you the one who's sort of heading this team and, you know, taking care of.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  these? Yeah, got it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Then let's do this. Let's have the discussion internally and then you could let us know how you would like to proceed. Perfect. Just a small request just to make sure that we are not, you know, slipping through it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And I'm not following up with you repeatedly. I just want to make sure that if we could have a placeholder to just connect either on Wednesday or Thursday, just for a quick feedback.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  Yeah. I mean, would you just want to email me on Wednesday or Thursday and we can go from there and that'll be a nice nudge to remind me about what's going on and that's fine.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, is there any timeline? Like are you not looking to implement this anytime soon?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  No, no, we are, it's just, I, my calendar is crazy at the minute and yeah, I don't really want to, have a call just to sort of chat about how things have gone. It'd be easiest to do it by email.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, that's fine. That's why I was just looking for a 15 minute. I could email you that day if you're not available. Yeah.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  That'd be perfect. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can we do it for 50 for fifth? Which is Wednesday or?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  For around the same? Yeah, I mean, if you just want to email me on the fifth, that's perfect. And that'll be a good nudge for me to, okay, either push it forward or, yeah, know where we are.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  All right. Let's do that then. Thank you very much. Well, then thank you so much. Anything else I can help you with?

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  That's great. No, you've been very helpful. Thank you. Oh.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  All right. Cool. Then. Thank you so much. Oli, good.

Ollie Dotsch (ollie@stack.expert):
  To meet you. Yeah, bye bye.
