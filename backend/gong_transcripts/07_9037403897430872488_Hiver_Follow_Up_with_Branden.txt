Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Branden, how you doing?

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Hey, I'm good. How are you doing?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good, good, man. Appreciate you joining today. I was actually just responding to your other email that you sent me as well, but basically, your question here being, is once a tag gets applied, can only certain people with required roles in that company, see it?

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Yeah. Something along the lines of that like kind of like a private tag if you would.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. So everyone who has access to a folder can actually see everything within that folder. But what you could do is we could have it set up so that once a tag gets applied, it could actually move to a private folder, so that's something we can do. So like once a tag gets applied, it'll move to another folder where only certain people have access to it.

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Right. That makes sense. Perfect. Then just let you know my boss is here. He's.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  right here. Okay. Great. Yep. Hello. Hey, how's it going? Good?

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good, good. And what's your name and role over there? I'm. Earl. Okay, great. Hey, Earl. I'm matt. Nice to meet you.

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Nice to meet you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. And I guess so, yeah. So you used the Branden, we, Branden and I have spoke, you've been using the trial here a bit. Just wanted to see what else was outstanding. Was there anything that you were hoping to cover on the call today?

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Okay. That is one of them, what you just covered there. Another one is integration into. We have somebody who uses outlook, right? For their Gmail account. How is the integration with outlook?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Let me just pull something up here. So this makes sense. So you… have a couple options. So it's actually, we actually have two different platforms. We have the Gmail extension which you used, and to use the Gmail extension, you would need to use Gmail. So for the one that you guys tested with Branden, that person would have to use Gmail. The other option that you have is we do have a, what… I'm trying to think here.

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Like the web based version?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we have the web version, but I actually believe that even in the web version.

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  It's just Gmail even.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  In the web version, it has to be an all or nothing. So it has to be everyone's using Microsoft outlook or everyone's using Gmail. Yeah. So that person, is that person okay with making the switch to Gmail?

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Not yet.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Unfortunately, that would be that's the only option there. Okay? Or the other option would be that you all switch to Microsoft.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then, so basically, we have a web version which you're looking at right here on the screen, you log in with your Microsoft credentials, you have the folders on the left hand side. It's about 90 to 95 percent the exact same as the extension.

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  What am I looking at here? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, you're looking at our web version. So, the last one the one that you guys were using was our Gmail extension. So it was living directly in your Gmail. This is however on… the web. So you simply would go to the website and log in probably like you do for many similar SaaS products, and this is how you would access it. So, this is how people who have, who use Microsoft office use hiver, they just,

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  use it through the web app, but they can't do that. If we're using the Gmail extension.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Correct. Yeah. Nope exactly. So, if you want to have access to the Gmail extension, you have to use Gmail.

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  But it would be the same inbox in the web as the Gmail extension though, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But what I'm saying to you is that you can't use either… it's one or the other. It's either you use everyone uses the Gmail extension or everyone uses the web platform.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, yeah, my recommendation to you is to use the Gmail extension, which you tested out. And then for that person, to make the switch to the, to Gmail?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, is most of the larger company using Gmail?

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  There's a couple that are using outlook still? Okay? You know, they're just forwarding Gmail to outlook.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. I see, you know.

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  It's all our corporate email server is Gmail. Correct? Some people just use outlook to, you… know, manage their email account?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yep. Exactly.

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  It's not a different server, right? It's not outlook. Com.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. Perfect. Exactly. Yeah. Then, that, yeah, then, yeah, definitely still recommend. So for those people they would need to use, be using Gmail. To access hiver. Right? It could be a little bit inconvenient, but I mean, they could still use outlook on the side, right? For, for their other emails, but, you know, specifically for accessing all the hiver activity, they would need to have their Gmail open. Okay?

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Okay. Well, I think in light of everything here, we'd like to go forward and we'll just do like a monthly subscription right now. Okay? So we can iron some of these things out. So, I think, you know, just what we're looking at is the growth level. Okay. Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah. So if you want to do monthly, that's no problem. There's the monthly option there. Yep. And it's about 35 dollars per user per month. It includes all the following here. The one caveat is it is sold in buckets of five which I was telling Brandon, did you have, how many people is it for?

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Five? I need five.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. Perfect. Awesome. Well, I actually went ahead and just reopened the trial for you guys. So you should be able to purchase the.

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Checkout?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Directly in there. Just make sure that you monthly, make sure you hit growth. And then the other thing to look out for one, two, three four five, six. Looks like you have six people in the account. So just make sure that you remove one. Okay? Before you purchase. Yeah, because, it will, you know, we'd obviously correct it for you. But if you have six, it's going to put you in the 10 bucket. We'll charge you for 10. So just make sure that you go in there and remove one person. And to do that, you basically just hit the settings button up here.

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  Yeah. I bumbled around. I saw how to pull one out. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Yep. You should be able to do that. And then you should be able to purchase right there with the credit card and then you're good to go. And then, yeah, we have 24 seven chat support… directly in your account. They can also get on the phone with you 24 seven email support. And then, I guess, you know, when would make sense? When are you considering maybe evaluating this for the larger org?

Branden Certo (bcerto@masubrakes.com):
  I think we'll go with these five for a while here. I'll be in India in February and then we'll kind of review it all and see where to go from there. Okay. Yeah, this five will be kind of the core using it. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, sounds good. And as I was telling, you know, Brandon, we have a large presence in India as well. We have a large office in bangalore and we have a kind of similar setup where we have, you know, we have close to like 50 employees here in the U. S and probably around 150 in bangalore so, you know, and we use hiver to support that business.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, sounds good. You should be able to sign up today and yeah, if you need anything… you can either shoot me an email or just go straight to our support. Great. Thank you. Yep. Thank you so much Brandon. Thank you, Earl. Have a good new year and we'll talk soon. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. Bye bye.
