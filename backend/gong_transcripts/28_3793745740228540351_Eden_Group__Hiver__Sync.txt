Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  hello? Hi, Stuart.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good morning.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Hi. How are you doing good?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you. How are you doing, sir?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, I'm okay. Two seconds till I work out what's going on with my video. No worries. So, where are you guys? It must be early in the morning for you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Well, not really. I'm located in India and I'm at four PM in the evening. Oh.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  That's not too bad. Yeah, I thought it said two 30 in the morning or something that blinkin' heck.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Well, not really. We've got a remote team that works 24 or seven. So we've got U.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  S, folks sitting in the U. S for the U. S market. I'm in India. I take care of the european territory. So I'll be the point of contact for you today. Let me quickly introduce. This is the very first time we're catching up. Stuart. My name is Rakesh and I take care of sales at hiver for the U. K as well as the european territory. I have been with the company for over four years, got a personal onboarded, more than 500 teams. So today, we're going to be looking at your specific needs in question and let you know if this is a good platform towards the end of the day.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Sure. Sounds good. Good. So we're a small company in Edinburgh in scotland U. K. And we provide TV aerial services, door entry, access control. And a lot of our customers are like housing associations and councils. So it's kind of public services and the like. And we are struggling with emails a little bit. So we're just looking at a different way of managing it. We have an in house system for job management, but it doesn't integrate with any email systems. So we're trying to decide whether we go down the route of a new system completely that has email built in or whether we could use something like hiver as an add on. That gives us benefit. So we've obviously been playing around with it for a few days. Now, me and another office person, one of the office managers, val, she's been playing around with it. We quite like the look of it. But I think as I said, in our email, the one problem we've got is how we link in our, so at the moment we drag and drop emails from outlook into our system which is just a folder view. So it's attached to each and every job. And while it's clunky and problematic, we need to find hiver doesn't have that. So we need to find a way whether it's programmatically or some other way of getting emails easily into our system or attached to our system or linked to our system. So, yeah, I don't know if you can help with that or if you could put us in the right direction.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Definitely. Yeah. I mean with regards to management of communication, as long as these emails are coming into your common group inbox, that I noticed that you've got set up at an other company domain. And then we've got another accounts. I believe that's another shared inbox. The one that.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  that's correct? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So we can help you manage all of these, of course, help you organize these emails, better deflect the emails that do not require your attention, run reporting on top of what is important, what is not. And on top of it, like you said, you've got your existing system to manage the entire jobs. So what you're doing what you're looking to do from my understanding, let me know if this is incorrect. Yeah, anytime you receive a request from a customer that has to have a job allocated to it, you want this conversation to be linked to that job card?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Ideally. Yeah, that would be really good if you could. Yeah, what is this system? It doesn't need to be in our job. I mean, I can show you briefly what our system. I mean, it's ms access. It's like I wrote it. I've got an it background and I wrote it like it's… really clunky and horrible. I can't show you or send you some screenshots and let you see how it works. But I don't mind how we link in even if worst case, it might be that the conversation's finished, we download it and then drag and drop it. But if there's a programmatic easy programmatic way to do it and it works well, then that would be even better, you know.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. We do give the open API access by the way. I mean, if that can help you kind of have two systems talk to each other. We can look into this requirement now that's something that I do want to keep it on hold burner for now. Let's go ahead and create a complete system as a solution to manage your incoming requests today.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Can I try and understand, so, how many emails? How many conversations do you currently deal with on an everyday basis amongst a team of four, five folks?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  There's five of us in the office. So it's not a massive amount. Let me have a look and see if I can get a snapshot of it's. Quite small probably. So that's one more problem. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So that's another problem we solve like while you go ahead and look at those emails today, hiver gives you a ready to use reporting where if somebody asks you, what do we deal with in a daily basis? How many open pending closed jobs do you have today? Which represent? Are we connected?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  To it, I believe you're frozen. Can you hear me? Okay 15?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  1,617. Hold on.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Right. So there's 50 to 100 emails yesterday, about 60 or 70 emails yesterday. So it's not a massive amount this morning. There's already 30 emails. But the problem we're having is not, it's not the volume of emails. It's when there's a conversation going on. We have one person that's responsible for the mailboxes, and they, that rotates between a couple of people.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So the converse, the response to an email never goes back to the same person. So a person picks it up, they have to learn everything about that job, and it just, it's a waste of time and energy. So it would be good, if a conversation is going on about a job or about whatever subject it is that it goes to the same person. And we've tried that out this week and it works really quite well. You know, I sent an email and then the response to that email came back to my assigned person. So I quite like that. Yeah, absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And another problem that we're going to be solving here for you is like you literally had to go manually, look at the number of emails, right? That was just like, yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I know, I've seen your stats already, man? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. The statistics in hybrid will always tell you what's happening for a day, which representative, or what sort of emails, how long are we taking to respond to those? How many of them are open, pending close requests for a day? And of course, you can then make strategic decisions on what category of females do we really deal with? And are these certain emails that do not require your attention? That will be like auto closed by hybrid in the workflow, then assigning emails to the right set of people as per the jobs, the skill assessments, and everything. Okay. Now, apart from that, given that if you're trying to look at the solution and want to fix that, any timelines that you're looking at?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Beginning of next year. Well, I mean we want to play around with it over the next few weeks, maybe even to the next month, just me and this other office manager just so we can get into it. If we're doing it, be well, potentially as soon as possible. But most likely January, the reason being is we're just about to hit the run up to Christmas and it's getting, quite busy. And I think it might, you know, if we can roll it out and get people trained on it, which it doesn't need a lot of training. If we can do that in December, you know, in a couple weeks, then we'll certainly do it, you know, but I think realistically I, there's… two things two, well, one, we need to solve the API issue and how that links and that's that relies on me doing the coding. So that's going to take me a few weeks because, I can't do it full time. Unfortunately. So if I can get that solved and we can play around with it for another week or two and it does the what we were hoping it would do, then we could probably roll that roll out soon after that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. Very clear. So ideally at least by November when you enter into a new year, you really want to have a solution in place so that you are no more struggling with the management of the customer communication, you should have a solution and everybody should know what they need to do when they log in into hiver. And and then probably, you know, something which is, very, I would say organized, in a way to manage the communication. Okay? All.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Right. And, what I liked about hivers, I know there's other systems out there that have CRM and other links in, and I can see the benefit of that, but it would be a lot of setup for us to do all that and to migrate away from our current system. And we're not quite ready to do that. So what I liked about yours is it seemed quite contained and quite simple and not difficult to learn, you know?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. I mean, it is one of those, I mean, so I mean, to be very honest, I've been into, this ecosystem, this domain for over 10 years. I personally sold a close competitor to Zendesk. I know what it is to set up these heavy systems. Unlike you said like, very clearly hybrid is easy to use. It's more of a just setting it up in couple of weeks. I would say, I mean, not even weeks in hours. And then as long as the teams are available, we do a training for them. And one of those easiest user interface that you would ever get to get across. Now, I'm sharing my screen. If you notice I'm logged into app, hiver, you're already aware? Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, absolutely. Now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  This is my logins from outlook. So you're not even creating new logins for your agents. All five people who are going to be using hiver to manage emails every day would log in into hiver with their existing outlook.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Okay. So they don't need their own, right? So that's that reduces the cost a bit and outlook doesn't it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, but everybody has to have their individual outlook logins which I'm presuming that they already have.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Sorry, two seconds. I've just had a phone call. I need to pass a message.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Sorry, just a customer trying to get me, but I was just because making sure the office, no, that's fine. Right? Carry on. Yeah, show me, yeah, so.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I was saying that everybody would have their own login credentials from outlook. So they would just simply use their individual login. So authenticate and log in into hiver just once on the very first top here on the no, if you notice there are personal inboxes connected, which I know at the moment, you have not done it. But even if the teammates, every user in your team would want to just look at their personal inbox, they can just get to see it right from the inbox here that.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Would be useful. How do I add that in? Can you show me briefly sure?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You click here on the profile page?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Huh, my settings?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Personal inbox. Okay?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  And.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  you connect your inbox? Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, so that was settings, personal inbox, and then add, yeah, that's perfect. I'm sure. I didn't know that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. Let's let's do this way since you have already set up your account. Let me give you a walkthrough on your use cases on your emails, on your setup. Okay? That'll give you of course, number one, better understanding of what emails do we deal with today and how sure, you know, how we could improvise on it. And then we'll also take care of a quick training on it. So if you could just show you, do you want me?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  To share, are you going to share my screen? Yeah. So share screen. Where did I put it? Here? We go. There we go. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. All.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Right. So, can you see that and click on things or do you, I just mean, let's click.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm waiting for the screen to appear a minute. Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Okay. It's definitely sharing. Now, there you go. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Now, if you see you're logged into hiver, you've got all the emails coming into the accounts and added inbox. Okay? Now, the way this is wherever I was referring to, if you go to your profile page here on.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Your profile page, which is where, sorry?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  At the bottom where you see the login option?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Down there, you're showing me that I've just noticed your circle. I've got a big screen and it's like where is it? Okay? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then you click on to the, my settings option and,

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  have your personal inbox here. Okay?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then you can just simply connect your personal inbox, and that's pretty much it. Now, this is an individual setting. A lot of my customers do not want their personal inbox, they just want ticketing as a ticketing. They don't want to really mess around with the person, but most of my customers find it, very useful because they don't want to toggle between multiple screens if they can log in into hiver, manage their personal emails and the business emails in one screen. Nothing like it.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. So I don't need, I don't need outlook on my desktop then if I'm using this, is that correct?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. You do not. Yes, that's a one stop solution to manage your both emails.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Right. Okay. Good. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, second thing to notice is the notification settings here now real quick as, and when you receive emails, do you want to get yourself notified? You want to turn on the soundbar notifications and everything, you could just play around right from here?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  No. Okay. Yeah, that's cool. Okay. That's really good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Now, apart from that, could you also click here one more time onto the profile page here? Now, there is something called team availability. Now, if you notice this now, as long as you add more users, to your account, you will be able to manage their availability right from here.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Okay. Which.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Meaning when they're online, hiver will allocate them emails, the job would jobs would be assigned to them and I can keep myself away when I do not want these emails to be assigned to me.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, we've got five people in the office, three managers or two, two directors, one manager and two office staff, we would probably only want emails going to the two office staff. And then once they've triaged it, they can pass them on to us if need be. So I would just mark them unavailable in that section or ourselves unavailable in that section. Is that correct?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  If there is somebody who is manually looking into these emails and triaging them and assigning them to these two office folks, these office guys?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  It's the other way around, it's the office reading them and then passing them on if they need to.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, are they not working on these emails directly by themselves?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  The office are, but not the managers. The managers will come in when they need to.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. Yeah. So the managers can actually go ahead and mark themselves away because they don't want to get emails assigned to themselves.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I think that's what I was assuming would be the case that's really good. Now that's handy to know. So that's under team. So it's the icon. Yeah. And so that's where the round Robin thing would not work if you're checked out of that. Yeah, absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The round Robin will not kick in because I'm away a manager. Probably, I need to patch it into the escalations, but I don't really need the emails that's perfect.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  That's really good. Great. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Now, if you see the very top on the top, there are conversations here.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  These are.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The conversations for you. Now, when you connect to your personal inbox, you'll have your personal inbox on the top. Other than that, you receive all the emails into the accounts mailbox, if these are sent to accounts at the written box. And if anybody sending an email directly to add an inbox, you would get to see all of these emails right in the editing. So, basically, you're from one interface, you're managing three set of emails, your personal emails, your office emails for accounts, and third, your add in emails.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, if I just a question here, if I send, does… that sent email become available to everybody? Because one of the problems we've got is the sent email is in the inbox or the person that sent it, not across everybody, you know, not everybody can see the sent emails. Sometimes. Does that make sense? Yes?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, with hiver, you have a complete transparency and the ownership, which meaning if I'm working on any of those requests, let's say you pick any of those emails from unassigned box. Unassigned is basically all the new requests which are not related to anybody. Anybody. For an example, let's just pick any email for your test. I mean, do you want to? Yeah, yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Okay. I'm gonna send one in. So I don't mess up. Okay, everybody else's stuff just.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me send you a test email. So give me okay.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So send it to you in group?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Give me one minute. I'll I'm just.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Gonna tell the staff. So they don't delete it. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, I'm going to be sending it into add in inbox. So it's right there.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I'm sorry, but I was just warning the staff not to delete it, right? Go and send one into eden at edengroup co, UK. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm saying sending it to eden group?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, if I go into unassigned, that should come in here, yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, it should come into the unassigned and I've already sent, that may take another second or two. Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  It's the worst.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right now, all of these are so manual at this point in time because we haven't set up the automations, workflows and everything. But with hyper, instead, somebody look at these 190 requests which I'm assuming that people would have done it from the outlook interface, because at the moment, we are still working the older way of things, right? Yeah. When we turn on certain automations, workflow, hybrid can literally tell you from the context of the email, the subject, the content who is even contacting us, we can help you triage these emails into particular fashion. And this could be you are automatically assigning emails to folks. You are changing the statuses to closed where these emails are just the notifications emails. And these are just like order punching emails, you don't want to work on it or you can automatically tag these emails stating this is a new order quotation request. This is maybe a personal visit for customer, something to do, with the discounts. Hybrid can help you do a bunch of things here.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Okay. Can you show me how we set them up? Sure?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We'll do that. Let's first go ahead and open the test email that I just sent across sorry?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Say that again, please?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The, the very first email on the test?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Okay. That's fine. Yeah. Hello. I like the cat, great. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  This is a test email and that's how your customers would also send emails right now. Let's see if this is something to do with hybrid test or maybe this is something to do with a commercial setup for any installation. This is the activity panel that would help you choose the allocation of the ownership first of all email assigned to at the moment, it says none, but you can always go ahead and choose the ownership from here. Let's say you assign it to yourself?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Email?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, this would actually move out of unassigned and it will actually be a part of your mind section. But if you're looking at assigned to me, then you're looking at all the emails either from accounts or add an inbox.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, it's from all of them. Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. But in case you're particularly looking at one inbox, then mind section says these are the emails respective to that inbox.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I see. So if I move that back, if I move it back to none, does that go back into unassigned? Yes, and it goes back into eden, absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Under the unassigned because that's when it.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Says we have.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No ownership to this?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Ticket. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Status by default is open, meaning we need to work on this job you have.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Can you, can you create different statuses?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can. We can, I mean, you give me an example illustration of what different categories do you receive the emails for? So.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Let's say estimate request or something. It might be one category. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me, let me take you to the admin setup. Can you click on the settings page here? Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And go to the, add an inbox please?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Down there, right? Okay. And,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  can we go?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  To come back or custom? Okay. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. Create a field. Okay. Use a drop down now, apart from estimates, do we also receive couple of more category of emails or is this estimator going to be more like a number variable?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  There could be six or seven categories. I need to work that out. I don't know at the moment, but I'm getting a feel for how it works. So I can then decide what I want to do. So this is custom fields.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Correct. And this will help you populate those custom fields on basis of the context of the email even if you know, these office guys are looking at these emails and understand if this is something to do with an estimate versus the quotation versus the one which is already a closed deal for you. So you have got a drop down and you can put in the variables here in the drop downs all.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let's just drop down. You can say option number one and then.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, option.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Two option? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'm.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  just thinking of random rubbish at the moment.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  And then create drop down. So that, so if I then go back to the emails, let's see, yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, you open any of those test emails? I mean, just open my test email again, it.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Was that it was under eden? Wasn't it not mine, yeah, it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Was under reading under.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Undersigned. Yeah. So back to there, and then we should have a, I see it there now. Excellent. All right. So, so you've got the general status, which is fixed, which is open pending or closed. And then we've got a general drop down, which is things like that, which?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Can be customized as per your choice. It could be, and, you know what? This is just not the drop downs even if you look at the custom fields, you've got certain options to put in the date variable, which is, when is the follow up view? Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Or?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It could be something like a number variable, which would, which could be what's the deal value for this client? Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. I've got that. That's good. All right. Okay. That's quite handy. That's quite powerful actually absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And as and when these emails need an internal collaboration and you want to talk to your colleagues internally, you drop them the notes here.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. I picked that up the other day which I quite like that, you know, because you can put a comment on it without because at the moment we send emails to each other with the comments we.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  don't have to and.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  then you have to forward it on and delete it and make sure you delete, it, which is not good. So I quite like that feature. Good. Can you attach pictures or anything to, is there, is it just notes or let.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Me, let me quickly check that. Could you click here once? Because the other product that we have for Gmail setup, you have the attachment here, right?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Okay. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You can, you can have a smaller attachment for references? Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Okay. So you can draw it attached. So let's put a logo in or something like that. So… it's there, right? So that's quite good. So that could be a picture that we don't want the customer to see, but is linked to this.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is internal, this activity panel is internal, your customers, your vendors, your suppliers, whoever contacts you would not see what's happening in the activity.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Would eat, okay, right? That's good. I like that. Okay? Great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, another thing if somebody has to pick up a job on somebody's absence for an example, Rakesh is one of your office guys who's working on a customer request, but is on a day off today. Now, Stuart you would want the second person immediately to jump in, what would happen from the team section is that I would get to see how many jobs are there where my colleagues are working on. So if you click on the team section and it tells you how many total emails have been assigned to multiple folks. Now, at the moment, I only see well, is working on one request. I see, the request been assigned to her. I also see certain notes here, right? But if she's on a day off, you always have an option to reply to this on customer on her behalf. Yeah, number two, if you do not want to go through the entire list of requirements or the entire chain, you've got summarize option here on the top. So, you see this option here on the top that says AI summarizer?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  This will literally read the email, give you a quick context of what must have happened so far. So, if you notice this.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  That's quite handy. Actually, you know, yeah, just summarizes it and not.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Only it, if you have got certain knowledge based sources available for an example. Hey, what's your cancellation policy? All of those which are repetitive questions, we can always turn on the co pilot for you, which is helping your agents draft those responses, quicker answers to these emails automatically. Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Is that an extra cost? That product AI?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  AI is extra 20 dollars per login. Yeah, but we can always look at it. I mean, as long as it does tick all the boxes and you want to solve this operational efficiencies. You always have a choice to start plain and of course, add on AI later as well. Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, no, no. It's handy to know that, yeah, that's good. Got it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, replying to an email is super easy that you do. I mean, just click on reply. And one thing that I always recommend my customers is that because you are also adding all folks to your add in inbox and accounts and bots. You do not have to keep them in CC. So while you're responding to any test email for an example, yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I'm looking for the one I had, where did I put it? The same? Did I change it? No, I didn't where was the one from you? That's.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  in the add in inbox?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I say I'm in our accounts, of course, right? Can you change the order of those inboxes or is it just alphabetically? I,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  believe that's alphabetically. I mean, do you want to keep? Okay?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  You usually, eden is the one that we work on the most and the accounts is a kind of background thing, but that's okay. As long as I know which way around it is. So it was an under unassigned hiver test where's reply. Would I reply to that? So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You reply right from here?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  The pop up is hiding it. It's okay. I've got it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Now, when you're replying, you get an option to reply from your eden inbox email address, or once you connect to your postal inbox, you also get an option to reply from your Stuart at the rate inbox email address, which is your postal email, yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, where do you select that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  For that, you need to first connect to your postal inbox.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, you need to be configured first, but it would be an option on the top.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Would it, yes, from here itself, you will get an option to drop down.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I'll play around with that later then.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Sure. Apart from that, you would also have these options for the email templates. Now, think of the different scenarios where these emails are repetitive in nature. Now, you don't want to cut copy paste. I mean, your teammates would also be able to kind of just make the drafts, everything that's possible right there and you should be able to, you know, use these templates.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  One's been done already, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And you can go ahead and create more such templates. These are available for private use for public use. I mean everybody in the team can actually.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Share it, right? That's quite good. All right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Apart from that, now, let's say if you are done with an email which is in the Aiden inbox. And now it needs to move to accounts because we want to generate an inbox invoice for the customer. For an example, all you want to do is you don't have to forward email to another inbox. What rather you would do is, could… you click here for me just once?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Sure. Sorry, I was just writing something down. So, click there just once, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  On the top here.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Do we not need to come out of this email first? No. Oh, sorry. Where are you pointing to go and show me again?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Now, do you see this option here?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I don't see anything circled.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. I'll take you to.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  It, oh, I see it now. Yeah. Okay. Right. Gotcha. I was looking the other side. There we go. Okay. Right? So, what's this one? I didn't see what that did. Can?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You click on cross button here. I want to make sure that there's an option. Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Do you want to click on that? Yeah, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Please? Okay. So that's a closed activity panel. I want to make sure that when you're okay. Can you delete the draft? Can you actually?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Take the email. Yeah, I was just thinking we're still in the draft. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You can delete the draft. It's fine. Now, you would get an option here, which says the three dots here, and you can remove this email from edit inbox and move it to another inbox for sure. Yeah. And that is possible through. Okay. Let me just quickly check.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Remove from shared mailbox, maybe?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Here. Yeah, remove, yeah, you see the option, remove the shared from the shared inbox. Yeah, this is where you would want to move email from one inbox, to another. And now you get an option to add it back to another inbox. If you see this one on the top right next to printing option?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You can done, you can now add it to accounts inbox. Yeah, that's how you could manage to have one email from another inbox without forwarding it or maybe, you know, having to have your personal emails and boxes cluttered. Now, this email is sitting inside the unassigned for the accounts.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. For now, I think.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I've gone to the wrong place. Yeah. Now, where's that email gone signed to me? No, it was under eden, the one from you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think we chose to unassign it from both.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Ah, so it's under all assigned up there, right? Okay. That's it there, isn't it? No, that's not it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I've lost it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, we can search what was your, what was your email address again?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You could go to the conversation and search for the email. Yeah. What's.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  your.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  team section. Can you go to the conversation?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I got your room and then search there? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just type in my name. Rakash, R a KESH, it's.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  not quite allowing me to click on it. You.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You should be, can you click here?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, they're right? My name, R a KE.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  S. H… huh. They are.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And that's how you could do a generic search also. Now, if you notice it does not belong to any inbox?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. So we need to assign it and it's through this icon here. So I can assign it to, yeah, or?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You can add it to the shared mailbox here also, yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Possible, right? Both ways.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, we also figured out another functionality. If somebody calls you and asks for a status of the conversation, you can just simply go into the search button, ask for their name, email address. The context hiver should be able to pull up the conversations for you.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  And is that even if it's assigned to other people? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah, that's.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  good, great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, apart from that, can you again, take me to the settings page here? I'll show you a couple of more things on workflow. Now… if you take me to the add an inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Here under the auto assignment, let's say if you want your users to work on these emails, which could be, which should be round Robin to folks, you could just simply turn this on. And irrespective of manual intervention, hiver will start to assign first email to sword, second to recast third for wall and whoever is offline. I would skip that representative.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. That's right. That's not something. I think we do it on a time base. Somebody's on the inbox from the morning, somebody in the afternoon, so on and so forth.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We might.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Try out as part of the trial, just to see if it can benefit us.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. So second is the automations workflow. Now, this is very handy when you want to route emails very specific to skill sets for an example. Can you click on, create an automation? We can just play around with one of those tests. Now, let's see you receive emails which talk about estimates. You know, this is an important conversation. You don't want this on it, right? What you can do is maybe just type in here on the top, give it a name called estimate… emails. These are coming into your inbox. And instead of from, can you drop down this flu? Yeah. Now, let's say this exactly is any of instead of is, I would say let's make it a broader search. Yeah, contains any of now you put in the keywords, what could be those, you know, customer quotes?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, estimate, of course, probably the two things.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then instead of that, I would also add another condition, which could be, yeah, estimate.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And even the body of the email, let's say from, and instead of that, if you, yeah, the body contains any of any other keywords that you can think of in the world? Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I'll add that later.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Then you get an option to simply assign such conversations, to a representative on the fly. Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, it's true really? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Also because, these are billing emails, these are important emails. I might want to send them a quick thank you note. All I can do is add an action at the bottom here.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  And instead.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  of update, send a reply to the customer and that's where you could create, yeah, add a reply and you can keep a quick template here. Hey, thank you for contacting we're looking into your request and things like it.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, just put something. I would make it random at the moment. But yeah. Okay. Yeah. So if I now send, could you send me another email then I,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  will I will, yeah, let me,

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  he's in group and put estimate or something and then we'll see, just see what happens. Hopefully that'll work.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  That should go back to me then. Shouldn't it, I'm not sure we'll use that, but I can see, I can see how it might be beneficial. Actually, I can see how that might be beneficial…

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Tea's gone cold.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, what other, just while that's coming through, what other channels? I can see that there's a chat which you can add a link on our website. And, I, we don't do that just now, but it might be a good thing to add in. What other channels can you link into? We?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Are working on voice? It will be, it will be out by December, which is going to be a voice phone call through air call integration. All right. And then we'll also look at the whatsapp if your customers contact you on whatsapp for business. So you'll have whatsapp voice. And then there's this most important thing which is the knowledge base, which is more of a self help, right? I mean, you want to give your customers a quick link which is help aidengroup. Com. And then they can try and find help themselves. If they do not get assistance that's when they can start a chat with your team?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Okay. I did see the knowledge base. I had a quick look at that. I haven't had time to go back at it, but it looks quite good. Right there. It's coming while we were chatting. So, there you go. It's been assigned to me that's cool. Yeah, that's quite nice. Yeah. And,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  or we just looked at one quick use case, think of emails coming in from a very specific suppliers because you might be procuring absolutely. Yeah. And then you can route it and you can even automatically tag those emails. This could be an estimate.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  See that could be quite so. So, an invoice or let's say a supplier invoice, you could tag them as invoices as opposed to statements, you could tag as statements. So that's quite good as well. Yeah, yeah. And,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  for that, you just need to make sure that you've got these tags readily available and workflow automations and hiver automatically takes care of tagging assigning replying to these emails wherever necessary and,

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  that's still, that's all done in the same place with that automation side of thing. Is it that's quite nice? That's good. I like that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Apart from that, do you receive emails which are time sensitive and you've got some triggers on the back end? Like you want to say the response should happen in four hours or things like it?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Not normally well, if somebody's sending us an emergency job, for example, so, let's say, you know, an emergency job we've got to retain, attend to either same day or within?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  That could be.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  An urgent basis, right? You want to deal with that? Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  You're talking about adding sle to that one? Yeah, because you can show me how that works. Yeah, because I mean, we may use it, we may.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Use it absolutely. Now, under the tags. Let's first of all, go ahead and create a tag called urgent. Let's say, just deal with an email which is absolutely urgent. So, let's say it's an urgent email.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Version one. So just add up here then. Yeah, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah… urgent, maybe pick your favorite.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Color.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  let's go back to the settings again, yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Settings down here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Inside the edit inbox.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Oh, so back into that sle under, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Create an sle policy.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  And say.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Urgent emails?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Job request. See, yep.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, instead of all conversations drop down and say inbound?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Inbound?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any of tags urgent?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, sorry, say again, just.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Search for a tag urgent?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Oh, so that's the actual tag? Yeah. Okay. It's not there.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is it… could you?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Did we save it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I believe we did.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Or did I spell it wrong? That would be a normal thing for me. I'm just going to cancel that just now. So where was this? Again? It was back into here? No, it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Was tags under the conversations?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Under the conversations? Excuse me. Sorry, tags… I did create it urgent. I did spell.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It wrong. Okay. I believe we're going to search it with the caps. U, I mean, it has to be.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Ah, okay. Right. Okay. Gotcha. So it's tied. Yeah, fair enough. So, back to settings.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Add an inbox?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Oh, it's the bot inbox that's the bit. I'm going to keep forgetting there, create an SLA policy or… I've got a new keyboard and I keep typing wrong. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Urgent. And then.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Any tags or inbound conversations? Yeah, thanks for the reminder. And it was our urgent.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  With U, caps… this time, we should be able to, it's.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  not finding it all selected.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Just, can you go all selected tags? You don't get it? Okay. Let's go ahead and first of all, cancel this one for now. Let's create the policy. We'll again, come back and edit this for you.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, the first response to these urgent emails are going to be say eight hours, yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And resolution to these urgent emails should not be beyond 48 hours. Let's say, I mean, which is you're closing the?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Ticket back and forth 24. Yeah. Oh, I see, right? It can have a back and forth as well. All right. So, it's like it's quite good. So, it's like a mini ticketing system. Yeah, because we don't need a proper fancy ticketing system, but that would certainly work.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But it is still giving you the context to control the action labels on urgent emails I.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  get that now?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We can.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  How do you edit it when you're in there?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  There's a pencil button here, the edit pencil button right here in front of the.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Do you know that's not visible for me? It's until you go over it? Yeah, that's fine. Right? So, I'm just wondering if we can find.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yep. Well, that's very strange. Why aren't we.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  could be a wee bug there. I don't know, well, let's find a tag.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Truly. Yeah. Okay. Let's find a tag which were older tags that you've created already. So you see all of those tags here. Can you scroll this drop down here? Like, can you scroll this up? There are plenty of tags, right? Can you… yeah, can you scroll at the bottom and see, do we see anything with urgent?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  No, apply selected tags. I don't know.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you mind if we refresh this page once? Yeah, I would make a note of this and let my team know about it.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  You can drop me an email when you get it working. I don't think it's a top priority for us, but it's I think there's other things we want to solve first. And then as we use it more, we can add some of the things in it's not coming back there. It's coming back now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, it's not finding it. I'll leave that with you. It's not, I will at the moment. It's not a big.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  problem. I'll go ahead and figure that out and send you an email about it.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's cool. Right? Okay. Business hours I've seen.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, business hours are like, you want to set up your business hours, whatever working hours do you work on, and then the, so.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  What can that be used for? If I set up the business hours?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It'll be more like when you're tracking the slas, you're actually looking at the response times within the business hours, if an email is sent to you at nine P. M. Of course, the very first business hour is considered the next day when you're starting.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  The office. So you do want that set up then? Yeah, we're lazy people in this country… not very long days that's not. Okay. I'll sort it later that's fine. Okay. Cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You can call it general hours or business hours, office hours. Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, that's cool. That's cool. Right? Okay. And then apps, yeah, I didn't notice this.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's where you can go ahead and request a new app and we can help you with the custom API.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Do you do zero by any chance?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Zero? Yes. Let me check. I think we are coming up with zero. So you use zero.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  That'll be good to know because that's what we're looking. We've not got it yet, but we're looking at that for next year. So if you are planning to do, it would be useful. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure, absolutely. We already have Netsuite out by the way. Quickbooks are there. So we are working on zero for sure because for Gmail product, we already have that available. Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Okay. So, what are these are any of these apps worth looking at as well? Totally depends on your business.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Use case. I mean, if you do not have any of those solutions in place today, I think we can skip this. Zero is important and the custom API is important that I'm going to be exploring more for you?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Okay. Right. Go for it. Got it right now. Can you take.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  me to the shared inboxes again, please back?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  To here?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Inboxes?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Huh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And now, if you see the slas are already started running?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Ah, okay. Yeah. I forgot, we hadn't finished that. So that's and then is there graphs or is there a report? Is that down here? Is it analytics?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes. Okay. So, you got to see analytics for both the inboxes accounts as well as, yeah. So you see active new resolved emails, you can search for a time duration, first of all, Like do you want to?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  A time duration that's like just this week, So you can see the users. So the users show me who's responding.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Tags tags show you what are.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  these emails about? Yes?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. And slas,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  slas, where we haven't been able to respond for spoilations?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  That's okay. Yeah. What's csac?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's a customer satisfaction? Like, you know, when you, oh, okay. When you respond to an email with a little snippet at the bottom. Happy. Not happy with the conversation that you can always trigger. So.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  How can you add that in? That might be useful?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Go to the settings page again, please. Yeah, shared inboxes for add in… see that here. And all we need to do is just simply turn this on.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I'm sorry. Oh, it's up there extreme.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Left top.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. So you can customize what that looks like. Yes, you could.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Okay. You could even do, no, that looks good. You could, even do, you know, a text snippet, if you select the text snippet, you would get to see, yes, no, maybe satisfied types. Yeah. So that's yeah, that's how you could do that? Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Right. So that's customizable as well. And that's good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you could change the sentence?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Right. So that's not a public thing, but it gathers it back into the analytics in here. So as a manager, I can see, I can get the feedback on that on customer.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Satisfaction absolutely. And then, maybe, you know, on Fridays you want to run a quick report, understand how many dissatisfied conversations we have had this week, maybe do a quick phone call if that's essential. So that's how you would check the pulse of your customers whether or not they're happy. Okay. No.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I can't wait, actually, that's quite nice that's good now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  These are the reports which are available. Then you can customize the reports on basis of blend and mix of it. If you click on custom report, you could just see the variables right here. So let's say, look at the resolutions or the active conversations or the customer feedback. Let's say anything to do with the resolution first of all?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, resolution time there?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, by any user.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  All users. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then if you are looking at a very particular email which are urgent, let's say.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, we could.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  yeah. And then conversation could be anything on those lines. So, yeah, anything which is customizable through filters, you can always create such reports for yourself.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, you can.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Then export the reports.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So that's like export into, if you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Want to get a report on how many open pending closed tickets you have for everybody, you could get to see that most importantly under the dashboards.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Can I hide those things from certain users? Some of these?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Functions, this is going to be possible for the administrator. The users are going to be just the members when you add them.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  All right. Okay. That's fine. So, me and val are admin, but a normal person wouldn't see that? Yeah, they.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  won't see that they won't even get the option. I mean, of course, you don't want to confuse them.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  No, no, no, that's cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And under the dashboards, sir, this is the most important thing and a lot of my customers absolutely love the dashboards where you don't want to get into the reports every now and then, but you create a dashboard for yourself. Something like.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  And you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Say, this is Stuart's dashboard.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  So, you can customize what you see. Yeah, that's quite good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And you can see new conversations.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Just click on it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then coming into your add in inbox, yeah. And you want to report on new conversations by default and what you want to see is status of these emails every day. Yeah. So you see how many of them are open pending closed just with one dashboard. But while you are starting your day, you know, where do we stand in terms of jobs?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's quite good. And then you could create more tiles here by the way, if you go back here?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. I get that. Yeah, just do, just, sorry, I can't see that you're overcomming it, you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Can go back from the, yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. It's just the there's the pop up with you and me in it and it was covering it all. Okay? So you could do that. So you could do like email sent from say accounts… email sent and by group. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But different statuses. So you would see all the ones which are sent out by a team. Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, quite useful that. Yep. I can see a use for that a little bit that'd be quite good time to resolve and it'll help us see if the staff are busy in that as well. Sorry. Okay. That's cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. And these are the notifications as, and when slas are breached, new tickets have been raised by our team members. Somebody dropping you the comments and notes needing your assistance. All of those would actually pop up right in the bell notifications here.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Would it be possible to extend the trial for another week? Maybe sure, do we have to buy it or?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I will look into the request, give me one minute, sir. Yeah. And are you going to be adding your teammates as well? So that they could start to use it? Because I could see.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Just val and I want to play with it first. Well, I tell you what we need to solve is the API. So if you can come back to me about the API, maybe next week, I can look at how we can do that and we can decide from there. Sure. And then if that's a gore, if it is possible absolutely, and it works, then we can maybe look at adding the teams and everything.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So you definitely want to make a decision on basis of the API calls. I mean, if you could have.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I don't know. I just think I'll show you our system. It's really clunky. Honestly.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And that will help me go ahead and talk to my product team, yes, please.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I'll help you visualize it. Let's just see, right? Okay. So if I stop sharing that screen, sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  By the way, I've extended your trial for another week. So you have.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Thanks so much. Let me just go back to share screen and this is our system. So this is our job system. So it's something I wrote in like it was a long time ago. I was lazy. I used ms access as well. But anyway, so I can just find a job and I can. So this is we get an email in, we create a job, and when I create a job, I just, it's got all the customer information there. Now, the bit at the moment, see that's the email, it's just dragged in. So that's just a file system that's just a directory on our file system that we create through this icon there. I don't know how to draw or annotate. Right? So what I do is I do that, click that button there and it creates this directory for me. And then the email is just dragged and dropped from outlook. So from a user point of view, it's really easy but it's antiquated. And I was doing this long before there was email systems, but we're all used to it and it's quite quick. The downside is you can get, let me just have, no, I've never used this before. So bin, clear all drawings. There we go. How do you go back to the pointer? That will be that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Again, I'm going to.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, yeah, I'm working as I go. Let's just exit that just now. So if I come out of that and if we find maybe I'll draw.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  It's quite slow. I need to my machine's running stuff in the back. So you can see you can get quite a few emails and that's the history trail. So your system will solve that by having all the conversations in one email. But we can have, we also have emails that have got our comments on it. So it gets really messy and it's really to read it. You've got to read every single one. Okay? But your system I think will benefit us because we can see it all in one contained with the notes which is really good. Got it. Now, I need some way of coming into this job card and you can see here there's status updates. I need either a link on here or a link there or something. We could just at the end of the conversation, download it all and then drag it across. But that's going to be, really awkward, I think. So I need a way of clicking on here to load up the conversation. But if I do that, then I need, where do I store that conversation? You know, it's really assigned to the job. So is there an add on to your system that will do this? Or can I, is export, you know, is exporting the best way or is there a link or what? I don't know, I would appreciate your views. But at the moment it's just dragged and dropped, you know… it's really, it's clunky but it works, you know?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. Okay. Fair enough. Let me go ahead and have a discussion internally about that. Perhaps what I can think of is what we are coming up with is a URL, maybe a Perma, link to a conversation?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Which could be used as a reference that, hey, if I share that link right here inside the Dropbox here, you should be able to click to the link to go through the conversation in hiver.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  That would be one potential option. The other option is at the end of the dialogue, we can drag and drop it into the system that we've got at the moment. You'd have to download then drag and drop. But if there was a way to just pick it up as a active icon effectively and then drop it. That would be amazing. But I don't know you can't to doing that from you're doing it from a web environment to a windows environment. It's not, it's not really exactly.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's the only, you know, concern even I also had, I mean had this been a web interface? I could have thought in the hiver activity panel, is there a way we could have two systems talk to each other? And your web job card just gets opened up right next to the, right? Next to the?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Hiver? I mean we can we identify the job through this number here? I don't know if you can see it highlighted. One, four four seven six is the job number. Yeah. So, you know, if we can, even if we can attach them to the emails somehow as a tag, maybe then that means that job is assigned to that email chain. So that's like a ticket number or a reference number, so that, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That you can do in the custom fields by the way you.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Have a well that, that's what I'm thinking might be quite useful to do it or we add in the address, you know, we could maybe the id in tags or a dropdown. Yeah, a dropdown would work or the address might be the other way and then we can find them quite quickly. Yeah, don't know. I'm just throwing ideas out there. Just I'll let you guys have a think about it and you can come back to us with some suggestions. Sure. Now, I mean this conversation has been really useful. So I can, when I see val on Monday or Tuesday, I can bring her up to speed and we can talk about how we might want to try and link it. But I think ultimately certainly maybe at the end of the, or at certain points of the job we might want, we do want it exported and stored in there, but that might just be a simple download that we have to live with unless there's another system that has like a document store that might be better. I don't know anyway, that's something that we need to explore. I think, I don't think any of the systems I've seen provides a drag and drop solution. So it's just if you could look at the hyperlink as an option, we'll play around with tags. And if you've got any other brainstorm ideas, let us know.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. I'll go ahead and look that up for you, Stuart. I mean, since this is recorded, so I could just even play around with my product team, look into their recommendations about it. Okay? Give me some more time. I should be able to get back to you by next week, if that's okay. Yeah.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  No rush. As I say, we're busy. So we're just doing a little bit every day on this just as we explore. But hopefully Monday, Tuesday, val and I will have a bit more of a detailed discussion about it and thank you for extending it for a week. That gives me more time, no worries. No.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Worries. And does that make sense if we reconnect again towards the end of next week to kind of get your feedback?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, that would be good mate. Yeah. Okay. Just send me an invite.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just for the same timing on next Friday?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, sounds good. I'll.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  call it hiversync.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, same time is good with me half time cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You can even add val as well.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah, she doesn't work on Friday. That's the only thing. So I might ask her and we maybe do it the following Monday or something like that. And then she can sit in and have a listen. On hindsight. I maybe should have done this on a day she was in, but I've got maybe.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thursday if that's okay to reconnect.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Yeah. Go with Thursday and if it's not any good, I'll come back to you. I'll speak to.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Val. No worries. Yeah, absolutely. I'm giving you the option to edit the invite. Should you need to simply move it? Go ahead and do that? And I'm inviting you both and val as well onto the meeting.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Great. That's fantastic.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Anything else that I can be of help to you today?

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  I think that's all I've got enough to think about there. I'd say it looks quite a nice wee system. Lovely. I'd say we just need to try and solve this link to our system even if it's manual, we need to make that manual process as smooth as possible. So, yeah, just a few thoughts on it. Okay, cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Stuart. Thank you so much for your time. Enjoy the rest of your day. Have a good weekend ahead.

Stuart Baillie (stuart@edengroup.co.uk):
  Bye, bye. Cheers, man. Thanks, bye.
