================================================================================

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Katie. How are you? How are you doing well? Doing well? Can't complain? Where are you based out of?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Tucson Arizona?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. I'm based out of New York City. Oh, all.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I appreciate, you know, you hopping on the call here today. So just to hop into it and set a quick agenda, we'd love to do a quick round of introductions, you know, understand your role, what got you interested in hiver? And we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions at next steps?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Yep. So I'm the operations manager at enginehire. We are a software company in short, and we're currently using a customer support platform called gleep. We started looking for new customer support sort of software probably towards the end of last year. We were using Hubspot, but they just got real big and real expensive and not keeping up with the cost in terms of product from a support side, right? So we just started trying to explore something that might make life easier for not just like our customer service reps from a support perspective, but also like our clients found gleep. I don't remember where, but… it was like nice and bright and shiny when we were starting to use it. And now, as we're using it more and more, there's some downsides that we're not super jazzed about. So I just kind of looked up and saw hiver and thought potentially you might be a better solution for us. Potentially. Yeah, yeah, for all of the above, does that answer a lot of your questions?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, that's definitely helpful. And just to introduce myself, my name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here. So I'll just be, you know, your point of contact as you're evaluating the solution, would love to understand more about gleep, right? Like what are you struggling with today? What's kind of driving the evaluation?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Gosh, I mean, the silliest things, but I mean, not silly, right? It's meant to handle. So it has like an AI component, a chat bot, and that works fine. But it's also meant to handle our support email correspondence as well as chat correspondence and it's such a silly thing, but it doesn't separate those in an inbox. So if you're in a shared inbox, all emails and chats are just kind of like lumped into one communication funnel, which makes it next to impossible to organize yourself as a employee. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  found some workarounds but they're not ideal. They're they… don't have an ability to lump contacts into a company. So like Hubspot for example, like let's say engine hires your top level company and there's like 15 contacts under that company. This it just, it doesn't have the ability to mush them all under one like umbrella, which makes you know, if you have someone like you're my contact, right? So my email, you or someone else from my team emails you. I would hope that like you would be like, this is my contact at this company. It, we can't I have to assign each contact to a certain administrator like as their point of contact at engine hire, it's just, it, it's just a lot of it's not saving me time.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  There's.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  no direct integration from like our sales CRM into our support CRM. So every contact record I'm having to manually add. Yeah. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, it sounds like, you know, communication channels are all funneling under one folder, making like really confusing. There's no way to see like a view of like companies or contacts under one umbrella or something like that. Those are some of the main sticking points.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Yeah. Main sticking points I'm… trying to think, is there anything else that like we find really irritating? No, that's really like it's small but important, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, primarily email and chat are the ways you're providing support today. Those two channels, correct? Okay. And how many people are providing customer support today?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Between our onboarding representatives, and our general support representatives. One, two three. I'm gonna say like 10 to 15, okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we do have, you know, two solutions at hybrid that I can go down. Katie one is that we are one solution is integrated into the Google workspace, and you are a Gmail client, right?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Yep. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  One of them is actually integrated into the Google workspace, where we can provide that email management as well as chatbot solution in separate folders. And then the other one is more of a standalone platform that you log into that's like a hiver application. Do you know which one you would prefer to see based on your preferences? I can always show a bit of both as well.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  I mean, I'm genuinely curious about a bit of both.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I'll go into the Gmail one and they're going to be similar. Like the functionalities are very similar. It's just one is a standalone platform and then the other is just in your Google workspace.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Question?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Before.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  You even get started. Sorry. So if I were to say, hey, I really like your standalone like platform aspect of it, is there like a nice pretty platform integration of your Gmail into the standalone platform? Or is it like only if you use the one that's within Gmail?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we integrate cleanly with the standalone platform with sso as well. So you just log in with your Google sso, and we provide a streamlined email management and chat management. Okay?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Cool. Continue. Sorry. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But taking a look at my screen here, Katie. So this is our Gmail solution where we're going to, you know, log in with your normal Gmail credentials and you're going to have access to, you know, hiver as a platform and just to give you like the back end of what that looks like. So this is, you know, the admin panel of hiver, so we can engage with customers over email chatbots, whatsapp, voice, we have a knowledge base for internal external faqs, and a place for people to submit tickets in a customer dedicated portal. Yep. So these are the different ways we can engage. And then this is where we're going to set up the automations, the AI integrations, whatever it might be. So we are a full platform living in the Google workspace. But on top, right? I'm going to have my general, you know, Gmail inbox. So this is my personal inbox that I manage, you know, within the organization. And then below that are the shared inboxes or customer support emails. Okay? And then also, you know, the chats that we're managing as an organization as well. So taking a look, let's say at, you know, this finance share mailbox, when we click into this, it opens up some sub views beneath it that helps us manage the intake of communication. So the first is the unassigned section, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be distributed. The next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me. And then the team view. So really just understanding, you know, what is everyone working on in real time within the shared inbox or email, and which tickets are open and outstanding? Nice. We want to pause here. Any questions so far?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Does it automatically add every user that you have in your Google workspace? Or do you have to like manually assign or like add like if I get a new employee and I add them as an email in my Google workspace, is that, what does that look like in hiver? So?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Totally up to you. Who you provision this to. It doesn't have to be one to one relationship with Google workspace. You know, just, it's just people who need access to this for communication.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Neat. Okay. I'm good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Continue. So going into the unassigned, right? I'll click on this email right here. When we click into these emails as like a customer service agent, I'm able to understand the AI sentiment analysis, how the client's feeling. You know, you can use this for escalation purposes. You can use this for analytics on the backend. And then also a hiver tab is going to open up on the right hand side. So this is where we can do things like assign the conversation. In this case, I'm going to assign it to myself, letting the team know I'm going to follow up, take ownership of this communication. The next way we can assign work is a round Robin automation, you know, automatically distributing the conversations as they come in amongst the customer service team. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So identifying keywords in the subject line, you know, maybe keywords in the body of text and then routing it to that specific person. Want to pause here? Any questions so far on the routing? Yes?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  If so we use I'm going to call it an admin manager for customers. Both what I'm going to say, customers onboarding and onboarded? Is there an ability to route said conversations? So like Steve at plenix, is your client, is there a way to automatically route them to you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. We can route by domain. We can route by direct email address. So we can be like, you know, every time Steve reaches out, let's assign it to Cole.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  What if it's like if the admin manager is Cole assign like said company to them? Like does that sort of logic work or not really just in a different way in?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Terms of if it's from a certain company route it to a person? Yes. Yeah. So we do domain, right? If it comes from at plenix digital, let's always route it to Cole? No matter who the contact is.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Cool. Okay. Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then we can track like the status, you know, whether it's open pending or closed ensuring nothing slips between the cracks. We're working through these conversations to a resolution, you know, adding those tags for organizational purposes to understand, you know, what the conversation is. We can also have an AI tagging mechanism on the back end be working. So we're able to understand over a certain time period in analytics. You know, why are people reaching out? What are the hot topics we're seeing? And it will just help automatically triage and route those conversations to the right people. And then we have custom fields for further collecting data. You know, we can view these custom fields. We can take action on them. We can report on them and we can search on them and we can create four separate custom fields. You know, the first one is a text box field. The next one's a drop down field like this one, maybe showing the payment method or something, maybe, you know, priority? Is it a high medium, low priority email? And then value field and date range field. And then the last thing here is the collaborative aspect. So being able to collaborate internally. So I'm sending this notification to matt, you know, he'll receive that notification up top right here in the panel. He can then click on it. It'll take him to this thread where we can kind of keep having that back and forth. But maybe we need more information, right? We can also leverage our AI co pilot to streamline responses. So I'm going to draft a reply. It's going to search through the information that we fed it, whether it's a PDF or a doc. Maybe this is pulling from our internal or external knowledge base that we created from a support perspective. Then I'm just going to insert this into the draft, you… know, where I can send this ship this or do whatever I need to do. Cool. But I want to pause here. Katie, what are your thoughts on this so far?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  I think it's neat. I have some more questions. Yeah. So if someone were to email me at my personal inbox, and I needed to move it to let's say a general support bucket. Is that an easy thing to do from Gmail?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's exactly how we can do this. So I'm in my personal inbox right now, I'll just click on this email. So I can just add this to any shared mailbox I see fit?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Nice. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You know, clients love to work with us because we're just bringing everything in house to what you're already doing today and adding that AI customer service platform in that Google workspace.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Yeah. One of the pain points I guess I didn't really mention is our clients who are in an onboarding phase regardless of how many times we say, please email us at support, will still email our primary inboxes because they're humans, right? So like currently, well, Hubspot was fine. Fine. I'm going to say because you could just like do a connection. So anything I emailed from my inbox was like logged to Hubspot, but it doesn't there's a, no way to do that in gleep and B, the only current thing is like let me just forward it to support and that's silly too. So this is just kind of nice. I could just move it and reply from there. Okay, go on. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And then in terms of analytics too, is there any analytics that you would be looking for specifically?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  I would love to be able to see average reply time not just to first response but to even like in a thread. So I might respond to your first email quickly. But then I take a week and a half to reply to you that's absurd. So I'd like to be able that would be neat to be able to track that service level.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So we definitely have some great conversational analytics and workload analytics. So, you know, taking a look at the last 90 days of data, we'll take a look at the support mailbox.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We can see active new resolved conversations over the time period, what our average first response time was as a team, our average resolution time, overall response times as well. So throughout the conversations, right? Like how long is it taking for us to get back? You know, throughout that time period.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  So like replying to a thread? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So this will like show you like throughout the thread when like, you know, they respond, how long is it taking us to get back throughout the conversation?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Nice. And then like resolution time would be, I'm assuming probably start of conversation to when you like actually closed it or considered it resolved?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So just some great baseline metrics to understand as an organization, how we're performing, but then we can break it down by user. So, you know, emails assigned per user, emails sent out per user and then individual performance metrics below from an average first response time or average resolution time?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Neat.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You know, tag analytics, why are people reaching out over the time period based on active new resolved conversations? And then the workload association breakdown below and the performance that we have against those tags and conversation types.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Cool. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Just a good way to see what's trending, maybe understand where our team is spending most of our time and where there's bottlenecks, like within the business, got it the contact reports. So, which companies are reaching out to us the most? You know, which individual contacts are reaching out to us the most as well… neat the SLA analytics. So understanding, you know, what is our first response time violation and resolution violation percentage? And then how many times were we in compliance of these slas that we set? So we can set these triggers on the back end, Katie, where it's like, you know, new conversation comes in as a support team. We're going to set a goal of a first response time of one hour, right? And then we're going to set a goal of let's say a resolution time of like 72 hours. And this is going to show us how many times we're violating or we were in compliance of that goal that we set as a team, got it. And then if we don't hit those goals too, we can set like notification measurements where it's like, you know, let's notify Katie this conversation has been breached. No one's gotten back to it within this time frame.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Cool.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then like the csat metrics, so, you know, just gauging client feedback, we can send out surveys to see how they're feeling after the interaction and report on it from an aggregate and individual perspective, and then the sentiment analysis.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Cool. Any questions on the analytics?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  No. Okay. Yes. Well, so you, you're hovering over the knowledge base. So maybe you're going to answer this question. But in your knowledge base, is there I'm assuming a way that like a customer could rate the article? And then if, yes, can I be notified if said rating is poor?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Can we, I don't think we can rate the articles today, but we do what we do have coming out is like AI knowledge suggestions. Okay. So essentially, like we're able to understand why people are reaching out to your team and suggest articles that can maybe help deflect those conversations in the future or where the knowledge source is lacking?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I can show you our knowledge base too because we build it on ours. Okay. So this is the one that we offer for our clients who use our software, you know, made it customized to our logo coloring, you know, made it look really clean with like, you know, information, set up guides and stuff like that… videos, and… then in terms of the admin panel. So this… is where we'll manage the shared inbox of the channel. So whether we're managing our email communication or a chat bot when people visit the website and just curious, is it like how is the channel mix of the company? Are people mostly communicating over email or is chat pretty heavy too?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  I'm going to say it's a heavy mix of both.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So totally have both of those to offer. So if you want to, you know, manage the chat.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  How does the chat look from a support perspective? Like where do they, where do they chat? How do they, with the Gmail? What does that look like? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So it's they're going to chat like this is our demo one right here. So they'll kind of come in, you know, send like a message. We can have like different settings for it to like collect data, whatever it might be. Yeah. But I don't think I'm added to the chat folder for some reason. So I can't view, let me see. Yeah, I think someone removed me from the folder. So I'm not able to demo right now, but I can send you some resources as well to show you what that looks like.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Yeah, like what that interface is, cause I'm going to say.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, here we go. Perfect. So I just chatted in right here. So I'm in the chat folder. So we're separate like I think right now you said it's connected in one. So this separates it into its own chat folder where you can assign conversations and have, you know, that back and forth.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Oh, that's a really loud chat. Sound? Okay. Cool. So like realistically, if we were to do the solution where it's in Gmail… they're just in their inbox and it's over inside. So it's like a new chat.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Cool. Yeah. So you'd have like your support folder and then like support chat folder right here, can?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  You watch other people's chats? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Totally. So you can like see from like a live perspective, what teammates are working on. So this is showing everyone on the team what they're working on, what I'm currently working on. You can even see what our bot is trying to self serve before routes it to an agent.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Cool. Okay. Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But yeah. So you can create those conditional logic branches as well. So let me just go to the chat settings here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we can have, you know, pre chat forums to collect information, collect the data. We can also provide our knowledge base in the chat. So maybe before they reach out Katie, they can like find the information and maybe like to send it away. And then we have, you know, this chat bot here that can follow like a flow? Cool.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Do you, can you show me? I know we have only like eight minutes the like ticketing process. So if someone had an error or a ticket or they need support, like can they, what does that look like? Do you have a feature, something like that would work in?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Terms of like submitting a ticket from scratch?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Yeah. So like say our chat is not available or like something's wrong and they need to notify of us. Like can they submit like a ticket like the customer portal, create and track tickets? Like, can you show me what that looks like from a customer side and from an admin side? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, if people want to submit tickets, there's a couple of different ways. The way is either email that email address. So, you know, sending in a ticket that way, the other way would be through our chat. So a live chat coming in. And if the chat's not available, you can submit a form through our chat, which will then go to the folder to collect. And then the last way is just like this customer portal. So being able to log into the portal where people can kind of track their tickets and… submit tickets, log in, authenticate, and then submit request,

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  And.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  then it comes in just in that email format with the subject. You can also have conditional fields here. So like you're kind of controlling the intake.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  What does that look like from an admin side in terms of managing these tickets, where they live, where they are. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, from an admin side, it's going to go to that shared folder like in an email format. So that's how we're managing it? Basically exactly what I showed you in the email. Okay.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  So there's no, like I'm going to call it like a kanban like board view option? Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no. So it basically comes in an email format. It'll come in just like this, with like the subject, the information that they've submitted, where then you can track the ticket on the right?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Let's say our dev team works in Hubspot to manage their tickets that require, you know, their bugs or whatever. Do you have a link there to send this info to said integration? So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right now, we just have a one way integration with Hubspot to pull in the data into hiver.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Pull in, not out.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, exactly. I think the next iteration would be to create tickets into Hubspot. Because with Salesforce, we can do that today. We're just not there with our integration.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Is there a different ticketing system that you do integrate with or not really? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  In terms of CRMS, like Salesforce, Hubspot, zoho, some of those players.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Okay. So, but you do pull info in from Hubspot? Into hiver?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep, exactly kind of like this. See how Salesforce, it's like contact info. You just push?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Info to Hubspot?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, exactly. Okay. I know we are coming up on time here, Katie. So for a typical next step, I usually recommend like trialing the solution, you know, setting up the chat on your website, setting up, you know, the email management capabilities and testing with the team. What are your thoughts on that?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  I'll just be super transparent. I have like a nightmare day of meetings of demoing all kinds of solutions. I would my customer support team, the director of customer experience couldn't be here today? That was Mary that's who I invited. So I would really love to, if you could share this recording, so I can share it with her and I can get back to you.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  I'm going to say by the end of next week, if we are interested in doing like a trial period, is that fair?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, that sounds good. Would it be cool just to throw a touch base on Friday for like, you know? Yeah… and I can do same time as now as a touch base for like a potential trial kickoff call?

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Yeah. Let's do that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me just update this. And then, yeah, I'll send the call recording, you know, some more information on hiver that you can share internally, like, you know, product reviews and stuff like that, more information on our chat, customer portal and all that stuff. Yeah. But just based on your, you know, what you saw today, like does this seem like it's something you'd want to pursue further like for an evaluation, I.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  am interested to pursue it for an evaluation. Honestly. I think that what's really appealing is the, I know I didn't get to see the standalone product, but I'm assuming it's very similar. I think that one of our pain points of the, yeah… Gmail to support like solution is that is solving kind of like a silly pain point that we have, but like… nothing, I haven't seen anything else that can do that. And like since we live in Gmail, you know, it's.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  right. That's.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  cool.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent. I think it's just for teams that are like functioning so much in Gmail as is and where, you know, people are getting those individual communications to their personal inboxes is where we can really add a lot of value.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Yeah, I would agree. So, this is, I haven't seen this kind of solution. So that's pretty cool. When you send me the recording, are you able to include? Is there like a recorded demo or something that I missed on? Like the actual standalone product or no, not really? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I can share both. I'll share like the standalone product and then like I have a product walkthrough of both, I can send.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  I appreciate that. Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I'll follow up with all this information. It was great to, you know, meet you, Katie and I will, I'll talk with y'all next week. I just updated the invites at the same time.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  Sweet. Cool. Thank you. Appreciate it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Have a great weekend. I'll talk to you soon.

Katie Meyer (katie@enginehire.ca):
  You too. Bye bye.
