Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Talha. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hello. Can you hear me?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Hello. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, I'm good. Thank you. How are you?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Good. Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Great. Let me know when we can get started. I think your colleagues are joining in as well.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Perfect. Thank you. Hi. Hey, I think we're all here now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you guys have joined together? Perfect. No worries. Let's get started. Let me just quickly introduce myself for everyone. My name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver as well as your point of contact, I'll be the one taking you through this evaluation and helping you going forward, understanding you have already started off with the trial that you have set up with your, hello at the rate, email address, have added four individuals as well. I would just want to touch base on that, understand a bit more in terms of what exactly you're trying to achieve so that I can make sure that we are covering all those points and if required, I can help you with the trial setup as well.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah. So we want to use hello as a shared inbox and just a very basic ticketing system as well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. And it is going to be managed by these four people who are already there as part of the inbox.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah. There'll be three users.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  There will be three users. I currently see four there's one as Dawn at the rate.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah, Dawn, Katisha, and Katie.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Dawn, Katisha, and Katie, you'll not be part of it, Talha. No.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  I'm just an administrator.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  For now.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. I won't be using it. I'll just be setting it up.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But you would be part of hiver, right? Yes. Then we'll have to count you as a user as well. So in total, then we'll have four users to be part of it. Okay. Yeah, perfect. Great. So, could you talk to me about how you were doing things up till now? What things are important to you to change in the workflow that you're managing today, so that I can help you whether hiver checks all those boxes and how you could use it to the best?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  So, this is a new workflow we've recently set up Google workspace and moved from a shared Gmail account to our own domain. Okay? So we're looking at hiring more people and trying to understand how we can manage a shared inbox. We don't want to go with a full blown CRM system just yet.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Since this is the first time that you're also using it and you're now on Google workspace. I think you could start it off between these individuals, see how it works and how you're able to manage the shared email addresses. And of course, if it goes well, you can extend it to other teams as well. Would you want me to give you a brief demonstration of the platform or do you want me to look into yours, how you've set it up? And if we could play around with that, how would you like me to go ahead from here?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  I think a demonstration would be great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Sounds great. Let me then just share my screen and we can get started. I hope you guys can see my screen now. Yeah, yeah, perfect. Great. Let me know if you have any questions in between while I take you through this. So feel free to interrupt me in between as well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Just a quick introduction. Team. Hiver is a tool that sits right on top of your Gmail and helps you managing the shared email addresses which are shared across different individuals. Now, here, as you can see, I'm logged into my Gmail, which is Yukta at the rate. And I have hiver Chrome extension downloaded. And these are the shared mailboxes that I'm part of today, like how you have created it for, hello at the rate. Likewise in my company, I have these different shared mailboxes that I'm part of. I take an example of support. Is there a question? No, no, okay. Okay. No problem. So, I'll take an example of support inbox here. But before that, one thing that you would have to keep in mind is your primary inbox will remain as it is, right? So all the emails that are flowing to your personal inbox, they will have nothing to do with hiver, hiver's, functionalities will be restricted to the shared mailbox that you will create with it. So as you can see, this is my support inbox that I'm part of today. All my team members are here as well. Now, the workflow will look something like this wherein you would be able to see all the emails in one place, under unassigned section, whoever is writing to hello at the rate, this is where you will be able to see all these brand new emails. And from here, if I click on the first one on the right side, you can see this is my activity panel from where I can do a couple of things, right? Number one is I can assign this email to the right person. So among three of us, whoever needs to work on this email, we can give that ownership to that person so that there is no confusion between us at all times. That who is handling what? Once I assign this to myself, this goes into the mind section and this is where I'll have all the emails that are assigned to me. Now, for Talha, you know, specifically, although the team section is accessible to all individuals but for a supervisor or a manager or even as a teammate, this section becomes very important because this is where you will be able to see the open emails for everyone across the team. So that if let's say, Jeevan has three open emails currently, and I need to collaborate here, probably. Get it assigned to myself. I can do that or if somebody is not in office, let's say matt has three emails here and he's out of office, he's not going to be there for next two days. And we don't want these emails to be sitting here and waiting for his comeback. I would rather go ahead and select these all and I just reassign those to myself so that I can take these up while he's not present. So this becomes very easy to sort of be able to manage the workflow. Understand how the total distribution looks like between the team who is handling what and where are we in terms of the progress as well? Just taking a quick pause here in case if you have any questions.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  All good. No, no questions here. All good. Yeah, thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Great. So, in terms of the assignment, I just showed you the manual way of assigning these emails to yourselves, but you can automate this process too. In case all three of you are working on random emails. There is no specific rule that this email has to go to, you know, Katie or somebody else. In that case, you can also enable the round Robin assignment rule which will let you to auto assign these emails between yourselves. We can exclude Talha, since he's not going to be working on these and these emails then will go, you know, first come first basis between all three of you so that you don't have to assign them yourself. So this is something you could use. Do you think this could be useful or manual way of assignment also works at this point?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  I think both could be useful to be honest.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, of course, the manual way is always going to be there. This is just to, you know, from the scalability perspective, this is something that could be used as well. And of course, on top of it, you can set up certain automations as well based on the workflow. So if you have certain, you know, items that are only taken care by let's say one person, we can automate such workflows as well based on different conditions in the subject or a keyword putting there, we can auto assign those emails as well or trigger different actions that we would like to, right? So we can do different things in terms of the workflows as well. Any question on this?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  No, okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. I think apart from the automations and assignment, you would have tags as well to categorize your emails into different categories. So this will then become your online repository under tags wherein you can fetch the, you know, all the emails related to one topic. So you can create tags as per your workflow. And this will allow you to not dig through all the emails to find the right ones. You can actually club all emails related to one topic, so that it becomes very easy for all of you to access these. Rather, you know, quickly. So this is something you could do. And then of course, as you're working on any email, you can use email templates here. So the templates are something that you can create for everybody's usage. And as you're working on repetitive sort of emails that are coming in instead of typing out the whole response, you can just insert those templates by putting the keywords and it's good to go.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  If you want to modify it further, you can do that as well. If you want to collaborate with your colleague, you can do it right here by adding a note mentioning them so that you both can converse while you save this as a draft. So that if I mentioned Kathy here, then Kathy will give a notification and we both can converse in regards to this ongoing email so that we don't have to forward it or mark each other in CC.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So this would be for your internal collaboration. And then lastly, of course, the starters will help you sort of marking the starters as per the progress that you have made on any email. So all the emails in the mind section are currently open. So only when you go ahead, reply to this email. And if you think this is done, you come here and mark it as closed so that it no longer sits in this section and goes into the closed one where you can access all your closed emails in one place. And if there are any replies on either closed ones or pending emails, they'll populate back into your mind section so that you don't miss them.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. Am I right in thinking the tags are like shared labels?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you could say that, yes, they are. They're replacing your labels?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. So they do have an existing workflow with labels. So we could replace that with the tags?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Anything else that you would be interested in? This is the basic workflow that I've just showed you. I've not touched based upon the AI functionalities yet because through tags, if you are using labels and if you replace them with tags, you can actually use AI tagging, wherein if you apply the same tag to the similar kind of emails, so AI sort of learns that behavior and helps you applying those tags for you. And then you have AI copilot as well wherein you can get a help in drafting your responses in the ask AI. You can put your company details on which the AI can train itself on and help you with any questions while you're working on any email. So these are AI capabilities that you could potentially use as well.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. So we have had a few issues with onboarding. So everything is working as you've described here in the Gmail in Chrome on the desktop. Yeah. But we've also got ipads in use. Okay? And we've been unable to use the Chrome extension in the iPad and we have downloaded the hiver in Gmail app as well. But that seems to only have a mobile view.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. The mobile, where have you downloaded the app in the iPad?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  On the iPad? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So on iPad, it won't work. The mobile application is only for mobile at this point. So hiver for Gmail will only work on mobile. Did you try through Google Chrome in iPad?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah. It's not possible to use extensions on there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Then it might not work on iPad as well. So currently, then it only supports the desktop version, which is your browser on your computer and mobile.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Is that something which is like an important part for you to be able to use it on iPad?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah. We do use ipads, So yeah, we're able to use the app in like a mobile view. Yeah, it's not very usable on the iPad.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I can understand that may create a friction there. No worries. I can check for the iPad thing whether the browser is supported or not. But if you're saying that it's not working then… it might not, but I can check this with the product team and then confirm it as well over the email.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah, or if you can find out if there's any plans to improve the iOS app, to add iPad support?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I'll check that although we wouldn't have such plans in the near future, but I can check it because this is the first time that I'm also hearing the iPad usage. Mostly companies don't use an iPad, but yeah, I can definitely check and then at least pass the feedback so that we can take that into account and build that feature.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yep. Cool. Anything else that you would want me to take you through? Did you get a chance to look at the pricing? Do you want me to give you the view on the pricing, how that works?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah. If you can give us an overview that would be great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So in terms of the pricing, these are the different plans that we have. Did you get a chance to look into these, understand which plan will suffice your needs at this point?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  No, I haven't had a look at the different plans. We were more looking to see if the solution would fit our needs first.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You could look at that or do the trial, see how it's working out for you. And then you could look at either the growth plan. I think this should work well as it will give you the templates, the tags that you're looking for. So my recommendation would be to go ahead with the growth plan. And if you have more functionalities… or a need, then probably you can look at the pro.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. And what's the key differences here?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Between the growth and the pro plan? Yeah. So the difference is basically on the functionality part of it, you get more functionalities here in terms of better analytics, business hours, number of shared mailboxes also increase in this plan, number of automations, are, you know, will increase too. So based on the functionalities that you require, I think, you know, you can make a decision between these two plans.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. Are there any key differences that are important for most customers?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Not really.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do you require slas or analytics since we have not touched, we have not really discussed about those things. I'm not sure whether those are key things for you.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Don't, require slas as of yet. But definitely, I think auto assignment would be useful.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, that will be covered within your growth plan itself. So it allows you, to do auto, assignment limits is something which is going to be part of the pro plan. So if you're using the round Robin that I showed you, and if you want to exclude… someone, then I think you have to look at the pro plan. So we discussed this, right? Limit is here. Okay, you can exclude people. Okay, fine. It will just not give you the limit in the growth plan, which essentially means that you know for each person how many emails they should have maximum at a given point.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. Before they're unavailable?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So that.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  It is.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it's distributed, you know, evenly between all the users. So this is something that will not be there in the growth plan, but apart from, it will be, so at that point, what the users can do, just mark themselves away. So that automatically the emails will not get assigned to them and will be between the other remaining members.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, yeah. In terms of then the analytics, if you want to have basic understanding on the users, the workload distributions and all of it is going to be covered in the growth plan as well. And then of course, you have unlimited tags that you can create templates and all of these things as well. You have about 15 automations, which I'm sure would be enough at this point at least between three individuals. So, yeah, I think based on these things, I recommended growth plan to start with.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. I just wanted to discuss notifications on the mobile app.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can enable that so that you do get notified on the mobile. Do you have it enabled at this point?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  I'm not sure that's something that we were discussing this morning.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you guys hear me?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I can now, yes. Okay. I can hear you as well. I'm sorry, I think you guys lost me for a while. I still can't hear Talha, though, I'm not sure whether it's my internet.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Tags, yeah, the tags automatically have come over from hiver into my Gmail. Do I need to keep them there? Or can I change their names or is that all automated?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Which tags are you talking about? Are these labels like these?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah. The labels?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  These labels, you don't have to do anything about these are automated in terms of this is how hiver is configuring your hello at the rate and giving you a view in your respective Gmail accounts. So you can ignore them. It's just going to sit here in the label section. Tags are different tags are something that you're creating for the shared mailbox.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. Yep.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. The tags are going to be here in the shared mailbox. Got it. Perfect. Yep.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  And could you cover any comments or anything like that? Notes that we can leave on emails?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can do that from here from add a note section. So either you can mention someone specific. So if this is assigned to let's say Rakesh, I can just put my message right here and I can converse in regards to this particular email. So we can always leave note and also, you can start following such emails. So when let's say this is assigned to me, but somebody else is being part of this email chain as well so that it doesn't that person does not miss this, they can start following by clicking on this I button so that all the following conversations will come into this section so that, you know, okay, I mentioned, I left this note to someone. What's really happening there? What's the progress or anything that you would like to check? So that such emails wherein you are also collaborating with the other person, they don't get lost in the notifications itself. And you can keep a track on these. And whenever it's done, you can just stop following at any point.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. So that's kind of like watching the email without having to be on CC or anything?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yes.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Any other questions… are we, am I right in thinking that we can set up like schedules for example. So we all have different rosters when we're working. So that the emails that come through to the hello account on that specific day, go towards the person that's because it's the same every week.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You can set up the automation for that. See there are ways that you can do this. So, could you help me understand? Is it like that one person is working on all the emails for a week? And then the next week, it's another person and so on and so forth or how is it or is it like on a time based in a day?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  It's sort of split between the week. So one person will do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and the other person would do Wednesday, Thursday, Friday?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, like that?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah. And then we do have someone covering the whole week as well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. But.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  The person that is Dawn who is working every day, Monday to Friday, she will be only needing to receive emails from certain like from certain senders. So that's where the tags come into play. I guess.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, so for that, you would, you can rather create an automation if Dawn is only working on specific senders, automations will help a lot in that case, because how, what you can do in here, you can say that all new emails that comes from let's say these domains that she's working on or working with. So you can put all these emails here that she's currently working on, right? Let's say Amazon or, you know others as well. So all the, you know, emails that are coming from these domain automatically gets assigned to her only irrespective of when they are coming in a week since she's available anyway from Monday to Friday. And with that, you can also put another action of adding a tag, right? So you can create this tag with her name. Let's say, or these domains. Anyway, you will be able to find these emails under her name. So you can anyway find that. So you don't have to create a separate tag. So I think tags are not something that you should be using here rather use this automation.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And this way you can automatically assign these emails to her.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. All right. That makes sense. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  If you want to create this now, I can also help you with this so that we don't forget it. And then you can test how it works for her.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  And just one more thing on that. Are we able to see the emails and the replies that Dawn is sending as well?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That you can see anyway, right? Because you have the visibility onto everybody's inbox. So in under team section.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Oh, yes. Okay. Yes, that's right. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can put a filter also. So currently, it will show you only open emails for her, but you can also see across all status and have a quick, you know, audit in terms of the responses that she has been sending. Yeah.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Amazing you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can do that. And this is for Dawn and then you had, for other two people where one person is working Monday, Tuesday, and then the other is Wednesday Thursday. So for that, there are two ways, right? Number one is having this human button and mark yourself available when you're not when you're logging off and you're not going to be available. So whenever you are on your system, mark yourself available, so that only during that time period, emails will get assigned to you and whenever you are away. So let's say today? Oh,

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  cool.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And what you can do, let's say Monday, Tuesday, you're working Tuesday, you're signing off on Tuesday, whatever emails are assigned to you, just select all and reassign this to the next person so that they can take care of these since you're not going to be available.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And since you're now away, nothing will get assigned to you unless you come back and mark yourself green, perfect. So.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  This is, are we able to change the status via the mobile app?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can do that. Yes, you can do everything in the mobile application, what you are doing here.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  I just don't think it was, I just don't think it's best. The mobile app on the iPad is different to the mobile app on my phone.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because it's not supported for iPad.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I would suggest use it in phone itself and then see how it works because in phone, it works seamless. So you wouldn't have any limitations there. Unfortunately, in iPad, we have not really launched it, but.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  I, we don't really see status. Yeah, I don't know. We're just having a look at the mobile app now and just not able to see the, any of those things the status you should be able to.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  See it go to your inbox, the hello inbox?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Is it available for email auto assignment?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'm sorry?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah. The only option is available for email auto assignment… there's. Not like that little button that says available, not available or available away.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. The human button, you're not able to see there?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  No, no human button.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me see. Just give me a minute, see the status first. Let's address that you were saying, you're not able to see the status also right here to change it. This is what you were saying or just this only you were talking about?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Five?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So the status you will be able to see. So once you go into the hiver app, right? It will by default show you your Gmail inbox that's your personal inbox right on the left top, you will have these three lines, right? You click on that. And then you'll be able to see all these options like we have here where you have your inbox draft assigned to me. And then your shared mailboxes, can you see that?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, you go into the, hello inbox from there, and then in the middle, you will have the unassigned, you know, on the bottom mid, where you'll have assigned, you click on unassigned, and that's where you'll have, you can just pick any email. If there is an email in an assigned grade. So, whenever you click on any email here, you will have these options at the bottom itself, right? You can see the status in between which is currently marked as open. So you can change that from here. You will have who this is assigned to at this point. And you can see all the activities as well. Exchange the internal notes. And this is primarily what you can do here. And, yeah… and then you have your tags as well on top if you see, and you can start following this as well with the eye button. So these things are available on the mobile app in terms of the human icon to mark yourself away or available something that I cannot see right now. Let me check if it's disabled in my, I think you have not even enabled the human button. Have you, are you seeing it on your?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  I can't see it. No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Are you seeing it in your?

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  Company. Can I?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  No, I think we were just using the auto assignment.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you share your screen and show me your Gmail for once so that we can just make sure that is enabled?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Katisha, are you on a laptop?

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  Yeah, I'm on a laptop, but, okay. Yeah, hang on. We're both.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  On our iPad. Otherwise, I'll have to switch yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, we don't have that. Can you click on the hiver icon on top and go to the admin panel?

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  This one?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes… click on. Okay. Can you? Okay, available for that is fine. You have enabled the, okay, you're not the admin? Let me make you the admin. May I know who has, who is sharing? Okay?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  You're the admin aren't you, Katisha is sharing?

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  I'll.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  make Katisha the admin. Yeah.

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  Katisha. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That she can make those changes. Can you refresh your page? Katisha? Yeah.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  These have come up now. Oh, no. But if I go to this… yeah, I don't know what that's about. Did you delete any labels or anything… not on hiver? No, I don't think you can, no, just hide them.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So your availability is actually on. So that is fine. Can you click on that human icon there next to the bell icon?

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  Okay. This one?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Click on that. Okay. So currently, you, are, you have marked yourself unavailable? This, this is fine. So this is enabled in your desktop. So that's okay. I think in the mobile, it's not visible because I also cannot see it. I'll just check this from the product team. Could you help me understand what, how exactly you would want to manage this from your mobile, you would want to mark yourself away? Is that something that you're looking for so that you can manage availability from phone rather than logging in?

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  Yeah, because we use our phone a fair.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Bit. Yeah, ideally, that would be, yeah, best case.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. No worries. Then let me check this from the support. And then I can report to you on the email. I also don't see it on my mobile application at this point, but apart from it, you would have all other functionalities to be able to manage, right? I'm just,

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  checking the mobile app and on Katie's, phone. If I go into settings, there is an option saying available for email auto assignment. So I'm just going to toggle that off here.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can do that. Yeah.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  And then there we go. It's changing. Oh, yeah, it's changing. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Then you're able to.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Turn that back on. Oh, okay. And it's back on. All right. So that must be the same option there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, perfect. Yeah, that's what I was thinking because it's not enabled in my account. So that's why I'm not able to see it in mine. Perfect. So I think this is resolved.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah, I think that one's okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And are you able to see all of those settings as well? Including your status tags, everything in the email?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Katie, are you able to see that in your, not the tags? I don't think on my phone?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Tags will be on top. So you click on any email in the shared mailbox, right? You go to the, hello at the right, pick any email there. And on the bottom line, you will be seeing your assignment status and activity on top. You will see your I button next to it. It's the tag option. And then there is middle one there.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Oh, yeah. Okay. Got you. Yeah, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do you see it? Okay?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  It says go to hiver from your desktop to create tags.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You don't have any tags currently?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Right. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So you can create tags. So while we are on it, we can also create the automation if you would want. Yeah, do.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  You want to do that now? Tate, that might be easier?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can actually.

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, go to the admin panel. Once… click on the hiver icon.

Bespoke Nannies Co.:

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Click on this, click on, hello at the red… click on automations. There on the left below… AI… click on, create automation. Okay. This is perfect. Now, we'll click on add step.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  If condition… select condition… from email… click on is dropdown next to this. Click on contains any of.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Is this for, is this for Dawn guys? Yeah. So what you might want to do is, does not contain? Yeah, it does not contain the department. Yeah, that's really good. Yeah. And then you can… there's a few other email address? Like the private clients is all random. So, if we just make like, if we just put, does not contain the agency names, then she won't get any of those.

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  Ah,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  okay. Yeah. Like, whatever is less in number. I think you should put that if contains any of, yeah, it.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Would be contained, does not contain, does not contain and then you can have DCP and then all, yeah, then all the other agencies, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you have to put their email addresses here, so you can put one as an example. Hit enter and likewise, you put all these email addresses, all these sender addresses, so you can put one for now as an example here.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  It can't be, oh, okay. You can just put part of an email address. Yeah, you find.

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  It's going to take so long. Yeah?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  That's all right. We can do this later. Yeah, you want to just pop in there? Yeah, just some placeholder text and then if you want to put in.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So you can, yeah, you can just, yeah.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Just pop in there like agency one and then, or, and then we can do the same again, agency two.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So just, yeah, you don't have to select or just cross that and this only should put all the agency names.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Ah, so will that work? Are those all individual tags or individual keywords?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It'll work for, all the email addresses that you're going to put here in this section, agency one. Okay?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  So, it's going to be agency one or agency two?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it'll just even.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Without selecting that or?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You don't have to select all. Okay?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  I understand. So that's like if we wanted to do based on the subject as well or something like that. Okay? All right. Do you want to just press that cross, on the right… on this one underneath? Yeah, awesome. So we can just put the domains of all the agencies in there. Yeah. And that'll do the job?

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  Okay.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  And then… would you,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  let me know. Like how many of these domains going to be? Like how many are we looking at?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Probably four or five.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, that's fine. That you can put here. Like it's not going to be a, it's going to be a one time process. Cool. Can you scroll down and click on add step there so that we can now trigger an action, click on action. Okay? Select action, assign to action.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Dawn has actually not accepted the invite yet?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. Yeah, that's all right. She's only started today, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's fine. So for now, you can probably assign this to someone else or you can just save this and modify this later and you can name this automation under her name, so that you remember that you have made it for her. So you can name, rename this as well. So now, any email that does not contain these domains or these email addresses are going to go to, you know, her.

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  Okay. Beautiful. That's really good.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Yeah, that's awesome.

Bespoke Nannies Co.:
  I'll just save it and then we'll go back and change it. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Just save and enable this for now. Yeah. And here, just toggle this off so that since it's not ready. So you can just come and edit this, and then you can turn back, turn this back on.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay. Awesome. And then if I log into my admin panel, I'll be able to see the same automations. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Will. Awesome.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cool. Perfect. I think this is done so you can start experimenting on these things as you begin using it. And then we can reconnect probably in the next two, three days just to see how the progress is. And if everything is running smoothly, and if you have any questions at that point, we can accordingly take those as well.

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
  Okay, awesome. Did you guys have any more questions? No, I just wanted to know about the labels and about the desktop. Yeah, that's all for me. Yeah. All right. Great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can we connect on Friday? If that works for all of you or?

Talha Khan (talha@bespokenannies.co):
