================================================================================

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Eliza.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, can you hear me?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Hello? Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, perfect. And is it Liza or Liza?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  It's Liza?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Liza. Nice to meet you, Liza.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Nice to meet you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Where are you calling out of today?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  From London UK.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, very cool. I'm based out of Brooklyn New York.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Oh, nice.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I appreciate you hopping on the call here today. So just to set a quick agenda here, we'd love to do a round of introductions, understand your role, what got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah, sure.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So I can introduce myself first. My name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the email management, customer experience space for a little over six years now, and yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can help you all today.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Nice. So, yeah, my name is Liza. I work with reddot for about… a year, but I worked with these people before in the… past. So, yeah, because the founder Kelly, he founded kind of the previous company where I was, so, yeah, kind of followed them and I'm currently actually looking after product. I'm more of like a product manager. However, our team is not big and we sort of came to this point when we need like a support desk like a service desk. And because in the past, I was actually leading the support teams like the client operations. So this is why I'm helping out with setting up this kind of, you know, the software with them.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, and I noticed the team was on the trial, how's everything been so far since you've been using it? I saw you set up a shared mailbox. Is it primarily email the channel that you're managing? Yeah.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yes. So, I think it's going well. I've got, we've got kind of like on a meeting all together and shared feedback. So I kind of compiled a list of questions. So I will ask you about like just a few things just kind of double check even nothing too scary. Let's say.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Gotcha. So it seems like the team does want to move forward with hiver based on how it's been so far.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Yeah, yeah, I think so. We did try actually because we're using atlassian for the tech tickets and for like confluence for the documentation. So we tried atlassian service desk, but there were a few kind of things the team didn't like and I think it's just how it is. I'm not, you can't really fix it. So this is why we decided to try this. And I think, yeah, the team like hiver a little bit more than, you know, atlassian product.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. And we do have an integration with Jira. So if you want to create tickets out into Jira, that is a possibility from hiver as well.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah. I mean, to be honest, we're probably not going to do that. It like kind of we don't need like the sort of the integration piece, I think for that because the tickets, yeah, we are not, at that point, we kind of need to create tech tickets, from the client tickets, let's say.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right, right. So this is just more for external support questions coming in managing.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay. Exactly.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So I can run through a demonstration here real quick. Just give you a rundown of hiver, you know, how we're helping similar teams and then, you know, feel free to stop and ask any questions as we're going through it. But taking a look at my screen here, right? And what's nice about hiver? You know, we are a certified Google partner. We live within that workspace. And on the left hand side is where you're managing those shared inboxes or support emails as an organization. So clicking on the support share mailbox, you know, as you click into it, you have the couple sub views beneath it, the unassigned view, you know, new emails that need to be delegated, the mine, everything that's been assigned to me. And then the team view, you know, understanding in real time, what is everyone on the team working on? What's outstanding and what needs to be completed and you can do things like bulk actions here. So let's say, you know, I'm going out of office, I can select all my conversations and just reroute them in bulk to another team member to work.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay, nice.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then you have, you can do bulk tags, you know, bulk change, status, things of that nature. But going into the unassigned section, right? The goal of hiver is to have unassigned zero. We want no support tickets living in there. We want everyone working on these conversations. So I'll click into, you know, this email right here. And when I do, we can do a couple of different things on the right hand side in this hiver tab. The first is assign it to, you know, whoever you want to work it. In this case, I'll assign it to myself. The next way we can assign work is through a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the tickets or emails as they come into that support mailbox. And then the last way Alisa is the skill based routing. So identifying like keywords in the subject line, identifying keywords or phrases in the body of text and then routing to that specific person.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  All right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm going to pause there. Any questions so far?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  No, no, sounds good. I'm not sure we're going to use the round Robin or the skill based assignment of tickets because like I said, the team is really small at this point, right? Right. Yeah, they probably don't really need it just yet.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. No, that makes total sense. Just kind of like first come first serve, just pick up conversations as they come in and assign them to yourself. Right? Yeah. Then you have the status tracking. So understanding where the conversation is and ensuring that nothing slips between the cracks, those tags for organizational purposes are really helpful for creating queues or folders based on these tags, you can also report on these tags on the back end to understand why people are reaching out? What are the top questions or queries that we're getting across the mailbox?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then custom fields, oh, go ahead.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  No, no, no. I'm just saying it makes sense. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. And then custom fields. So like tracking like, you know, dropdown fields, date, range fields, text box fields and value fields to view data. We can take action on this data. We can report on it and we can also search on this information as well. So just another way to leverage data to your advantage. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So sorry, the last way is collaboration. So sending that notification to Jeevan will receive the notification up top. He'll, click on it. It'll take him to this thread where we can kind of keep having that back and forth conversation. And then.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  that's internal, that's the like internal notes here. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  This whole this whole thing is internal notes right here to have that back and forth. You know, we do have AI capabilities like AI summarization, if you want to get up to speed on conversations, quick AI, sentiment analysis, and then also a co pilot for generating responses. So I can draft a reply, right? By searching through our knowledge base, the information that we feed it, I can choose which one I want to provide. So I'm going to provide the third prompt right here.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Nice.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then once it spits out that response, you know, we're going to have that ability to insert it into the draft to send a reply or further editing.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But just want to pause right here. Like what are your thoughts on this so far?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah, yeah. It's really good. I quite like it. I think the biggest sort… of advantage you have because it's a part of Gmail. It's within Gmail. And people kind of know how to use Gmail. So it's a little bit more familiar when you have to get the team on a different product. And I think this is why they struggled with Jira. I worked with Jira for like years and years. I find it quite easy, but then we put the team on Jira, and they were like got lost completely. So, yeah, I think that's kind of good. And I like, yeah, the notes are good. I didn't actually realize you can tag people in the notes. Yeah, that would be quite good. I will probably book a call with the team next week and show them basically what you're showing me now. So just to walk them through this as well?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 100 percent and I'm also happy to serve up like, you know, once you sign up for hiver, I'll do a team training call. I'm happy to do that as well for the team.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Oh, okay. Okay. Fair enough. Nice. Actually. Can I ask you a question while we're on this screen? Yeah, for sure. The one thing I wasn't quite sure about the linked conversations on the right, you know, what's what does it mean?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It gives you the ability to link conversations that are connected. So if you want to link another conversation to it… you can shoot another.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Email, yeah, just.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Letting them know if they're related threads, you know?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. And, and they just when they open this ticket, they just will show their unlinked conversation like the linked tickets if I need to.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly exactly that's correct?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. And, the split conversation, what's that button does?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's more of if you want to like split it off into another thread, you know, like, if you want to split it off into another task, create another thread, whatever it might be.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  So, it kind of will create a separate email chain, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. If another process needs to be done where you want to get off this chain and start a new one, you have that ability.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. And, in the queue, I will see it as a separate item essentially. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 100 percent. So see like in these all views, this is where you can create these different views, you know, billing issues, bugs, cancellations, whatever it might be.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Nice. They were good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then in terms of analytics, we do have some good analytics as well. Is there anything that you'd be looking for specifically?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  What, what do you mean?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  In terms of just like analytics, you would want to see from a support perspective?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  I'm not really sure. Well, I know like all this, like the csat stuff the slas, like again, like I'm saying the team is quite small. We're not necessarily like processing like a high number of tickets to sort of to want, to want to know like csat like or how we're doing on slas… but it probably will come later to be honest. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And we, and we can see some baseline stuff. You know, we can see volume, how many conversations we had over a time period, what our average first response time was, or average resolution time per user metrics, emails assigned per user sent out per user, and then their individual performance metrics from first response time and resolution time?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  And what are the first response and the full like resolution time in terms of the, is it something custom or it's just a default?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It's default. So, first response time is the first response you send back when an email comes in the resolution time is how long it takes from first response to closing out the conversation.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Oh, okay. I suppose, on this report, it doesn't really tell you if it's good or bad. It just tells you the number of hours. Okay. I get it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then we do have csat as well though within our pro plan. So we can also measure customer satisfaction.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Actually a question on csat, how is it done? Like what's the like the sort?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Of flow? Yeah. So you can either have it be sent automatically when you close a conversation or insert it?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, okay. Yeah. So I'll show you right here on the backend too. So clicking on let's say support share mailbox, the csat, you… can choose when it's added into the email… you can show what it looks like.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. What options do I want? Yeah. Okay. Nice. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then this is what they'll see, right? Yeah.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Cool. Yeah, I'm probably not going to set it as automatic on the closure. I, is it go manual. It doesn't set like as the manual by default?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You can have it, you can have it manually put in. You can have it automatically put in every message or you can have it automatically put in when you close it out.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  And you, I have to go to shared inboxes, it's from shared inboxes to set up, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. And then click on the mailbox and go down to csat. And there's a switch that you can turn off and on to enable, disable it.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Nice. Okay. Cool. Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then in terms of… automations, are you going to be using any of these automations at all? These are super helpful for streamlining certain things.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Potentially potentially. So, what do you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, think about where it's like, you know, actually I'll just show you how it's created, you know, new conversation comes in and we've identified the body of text. And in the subject line of the email that there's the keywords, urgent, business critical, stopped working. Okay? Since we've identified this as a business critical thing, we're going to add the tag urgent issue and then assign it to Raghav.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Nice.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And you can do a bunch of these different triggers and actions right here.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  So we can also add, I suppose if we get like some… not like a spam, emails, you know, sometimes from some, you know, like a providers, you get some emails that you just like you don't even need to look at.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  So, it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool. Yeah, kind of like filtering out a little bit.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then you could file it away with a tag. So, if you want to still organize it, you still can, but like no one has to deal with it and you can just close the conversation automatically.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah, that's good. That was actually one of my questions on the automations. Yeah, sorry, where did you go to the automations? Where? Oh, it's from the shared inbox.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. So click on the shared mailboxes. Click on the mailbox you want and then automations.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Nice. Cool. That sounds good. Give me just a second. I'm just going to tick off the things you answered already.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  So, the, also, can we add new statuses or we only have those three?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Those are the three but people use custom fields for statuses. So you can create a dropdown field and you can call it like, you know, let's say email type and call it like let's say technical, you… know, like billing status, like sales, whatever it might be. And then that will live on the right hand side. See how it's like a dropdown now, so you can create like these custom fields to further organize conversations.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Just adding in notes as well.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  As a part of our service too, we do offer some onboarding calls to help you with all this. So just something to also keep.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. That's good. I suppose with the statuses, when it's unassigned, it means well, someone needs to pick it up as soon as someone assigned a ticket and it's open. It means that the person is working on a ticket. Yep. And as soon as we set to pending, it means it's not with the agent anymore. It's for let's say with the client. Yep, we're.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  waiting for the client to respond to us. Yeah, exactly.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. And I suppose we can, yeah, like you said, use to use the custom fields to give a little bit more details, like we could add the custom field. Like I don't know how we would call it, but essentially to specify when a ticket is pending, whether we're waiting on a client or whether we're waiting on like a third party provider of something. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Just internal note. Yeah, like in a way.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Just to know what is pending, right? Just to give you the idea. Oh, I'm still waiting on the, you know, the third party client to respond or whatever. Yeah.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah. Okay. Cool. And the, what was, so, yeah. Well, the question around status is if I, you know, client emailed us, so it created the ticket. I'm working on the ticket. I don't know provided them a response. I set the status to pending, right? If that client replies back to that email chain, will it reopen the ticket?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. It will.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  So that's all standard. Okay. Yeah, I just want this to double check. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Cool. Okay. That's good. Well, I thought it probably, yes, but just double check, right? So, one thing I wanted to also check, you know, when, you know, I basically added this like, the hiver sort of app into my work Gmail. And when I reply to the clients, on the tickets, do they get email from my actual work email address or is it like a sort of like a, some more like a support something? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So totally up. So totally up to you, we can do either or you can have it be the shared mailbox id or you can have it be your personal.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  How, how would I change that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'll send you a help article here. This, this will, it's a partially hiver thing, partially a Gmail thing.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Yeah, yeah, totally. If you can do, that would be good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I just sent that, in the chat in zoom.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  In the chat? Okay. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Nice. Yeah. We basically, yeah… we want to avoid, you know, people just to kind of going away from the.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Support for sure. Yeah. So you can have that always be the default email that clients see. So they're not reaching out to individuals.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Nice. Okay. I will have a look at that, which is online.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And how many people will you need on hiver?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  So, I think for now, let me quickly check. Oh, no, two, three. We have five now… we may get two more, but yeah, we have a five, yeah, five people for now.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I see in the trial, I think there's six people in the trial right now. Let me see.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  I just sent it to the team. I see five five six. Yeah, it could be, yeah, I thought it was actually, I'm.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  seeing Rachel, Dominic, Ali, Lindsay, Kelly, and you.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  I, oh, I don't see Dominic for some reason. Okay. Yeah. But he, he's probably, yeah, he's probably will be one of the people as well. Yeah. So I think six then. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So we sell in buckets of five. So like five, 10, 15, 20. But since you're you'd be buying extra seats, I can provide a discount off of our services.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  So, what's the pricing like for like, the agent? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, it's 45 dollars per user per month. Okay? And we sell in buckets of five. So 510 15. So you said you need like seven, so that would put you to the 10 bucket, but since you're buying additional licenses, I'm able to provide a 15 percent discount off of the license cost. So taking a look at my screen here, it'll be 38 point three dollars per user with that discount. And, you know, a little over 4,500 on an annual basis.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Hold on a sec. I was looking… the.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Is there where the actual… what is, the 25 dollar per user?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, the growth?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Plan?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that doesn't come with the customer satisfaction?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Oh, the csat feature? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that won't come with the csat, which I know you wanted.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. We actually, maybe we'll try maybe to start from the growth plan to be honest. Okay. Just to see how it goes. Yeah. Like I said, we don't really need the csat just yet, but we probably will be, but, yeah, yeah, just, maybe to try out. So, I suppose if you started from the growth which is 25 for months per user and midway through the year, if you want to upgrade, is that possible?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, totally. Yeah, you can upgrade at any moment. So for the growth.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  This is, this is our proposal for the growth plan. So for 10 users on the growth plan, for an annual commitment, we can provide a 10 percent discount off our services. So bringing the per user cost of 22 point five and an annual cost of 2,700?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  When you say discount for the annual commitment, does it mean we have to pay the… sort of the yearly costs straight away? Or we still can be on a monthly billing, but just sign up for the year for a year.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, it would be an annual upfront billing, you can go on growth, our growth month to month, you can do that, but it's 35 dollars per user per month and I can't discount off that.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  So, okay. So you're saying if we want, okay, let's see. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I can show you the difference in cost. I'll just crunch the numbers real quick. So… so let's say, you know, for 10 users on the 32, or, on the growth, it would be, you know, 350 dollars a month and you can have that on a monthly basis, Or if you commit to the year, it's gonna be 2000 or it's gonna be 2,700 on an annual basis and 225 per month, but it would be an annual upfront billing.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Annual. Okay. And that's 10 percent including the 10 percent off.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, this is including that 10 percent discount off the services. So it's either, and so, you get like considerable savings by going annually, versus signing up month to month that's pretty much, the catch.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Yeah, understood makes sense. So just quickly one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Do you know which, do you know which one like you're leaning towards like the monthly or the annual?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  I will have to, I'll have to double check. We might, yeah, probably yearly at this point, but, yeah, let me double check what they want to do. And that, and that's the respect the, another thing I had, if you, can, I, can you please open the, just a random, like the random ticket, the random email on, on the app?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Let me see here. Okay?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  You see, after the subject line, after the invoice inquiry, we have this like a gray, tags, is it, I suppose that's the generated like automatically and it's, it's… basically those tags we have from the right? Yeah, when we add the tag it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  These are actually hiver system tags. This is how we're able hiver is able to function in Gmail. There's nothing like these are not, nothing we can do about these essentially.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah. So, well, this is what I thought probably the case because the, basically, yeah, the system needs to know where to put the, that's that specific email. So, this is why there's this system of tags and I suppose we, I need to kind of let the team know not to remove them because there is a cross button, so it is possible to remove them. Yes?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah, they don't want to touch those.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. Just not to touch those. Yeah. That's what I thought. So, I just wanted to double check… not to remove. And the one I think one big one. I know this is kind of a problem… lots of like support system like those service desk dealing with. If we have a email coming from, when it comes, when basically, there is a client emails us, we email them back, then they click reply to you and then it's all nicely, basically go under the same thread. So it's all the ticket is basically lined up like nicely. But when we deal with some automatic like automated systems, basically systems which sending us some updates, they always trigger a new email to like support email address even though it could be like the same subject line. So what basically happens, in the inbox in let's say, unassigned, folder? We would have two emails as a, two separate items, but the subject line is exact same. So, is there any way to kind of combine them, into like sort of, I don't know like a merged item?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, not currently, that's where link conversations comes in, right? You just link them together and you work one of them.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  But then if I change the status on one, it doesn't impact the status of the other, it's like they're still.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you'd want to, if it comes in with a duplicate, you'd want to close it out, close out the duplicate, work the other.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Okay. I see what you mean. Okay. So close duplicate. But then from a link conversation, I suppose you always kind of can go back like back to.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Those, yeah, you can just link it like link it and just quickly close it and then, you know, they're together but you'll just work on.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, I, to be honest, this is the issue. Like I worked with Zendesk a lot in the past and it's always been a manual thing. There is no such like, I don't know, automated way of nicely.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. There's.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  that's.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  a, that's a big ass. I've heard across my entire career. No one's been able to really do that without manually doing it.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah. So, and yeah, the problem with Jira, that was actually no nice kind of even like a linking functionality. So that was a little bit, yeah, annoying. I know we are coming up at time here, and I do have a hard stops.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, when would be, when would be a good time for you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And I know the trial is running out? Will you have an answer on which monthly or annual proposal you'd want to go forward with today? Or what does that look like?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Let me, yeah, let me try to do it today… so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Monday. Yeah, it goes off the trial and I'm actually, I'll extend it for one more day till Tuesday, so we can have time to meet Monday. Worst comes to worst. Okay?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Thank you for that. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I will. Oh, sorry. No, no, no, you go ahead. Oh, no. I was going to say, would you have some time on Monday that would work for you to connect?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah… Monday's a little bit, hold on one moment kind of similar time. Yeah, it would be probably good. Okay? Maybe even slightly later if that's all right for you. I did. I just sent over an invite for 30 minutes later. Okay. Let's try that. Okay? Does?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That work for you? Did you get that on your side? The invite, the invite? One second? Okay. I'm going to go. Where am I now?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Hold.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  on, I just need to close the, yes… I got it. Thank you. And that time works for you.

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Yeah. It should be fine. It should be fine. Okay. Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. Awesome. Cool. But I can send you over the details of the proposal too for the monthly and annual, so you can share that internally. And then we'll just talk about, you know, which direction you want to go on Monday. Okay?

Liza Shevchenko (liza@reddotmedia.co):
  Cool. Sounds great. Yes. Please send me the numbers that would be quite good to have.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
