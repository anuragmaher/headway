Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Les. How are you doing? I hope I'm pronouncing your name, right? Correct me if I'm wrong.

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  It's good. Thank you. Nice to meet you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Nice to meet you too. Shall we get started with the discussion? I see two people have joined in. I'll just introduce myself and then I'll give it to you. My name is Yukta and I'm the… alright. So my name is Yukta. I'm the senior account executive here at hiver, as well as your point of contact. I'll be helping you with the evaluation as I could see that you have already sort of tried to set up your inbox as well, if I'm not wrong?

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  Anyways,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  we'll take it from the scratch if you could just introduce yourself and also sort of let me know in terms of what exactly you're looking for. I think accordingly, I can assist you from there.

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  Yeah, my name is Lasse. And this is my colleague Sami, and we're just looking to make customer service more efficient and automate as much as possible, especially just in regards to generating responses and then just accepting them and yeah, sending it back got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It, do you have any generic email address on which you are currently sort of receiving these emails? How does the current setup look like?

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  Now, we're using Freshdesk and receiving it to something called, hi at folkekraft? No, I haven't started a user in hiver just yet. You had a demo, a quick demo user. Yeah, I started the free trial program but I didn't understand a lot of it. It was a bit complicated or a bit unstructured. And it was hard to use. Yeah, hard to use. So that's why we booked the demo.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah, I don't see any active trial currently that you have done. So, maybe you tried it, but then did not go ahead with it. No worries. I.

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  Tried it with a different company. So maybe it's.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  not going to work. Oh, is it okay? So, like, is it going to be for folkekraft or are you looking for any other entity under it?

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  Mainly folkekraft, but if it works well, we could use it for other projects.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And any specific like pain points that you're seeing with Freshdesk? Anything that's not working out for you and how long have you been using it for?

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  We've been using Freshdesk for maybe one and a half years and the main pain point is not the functionality but just the time of making responses. So the main usage we would have is like an AI that would be trained to, yeah make up responses for the different tickets.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you want AI to automatically sort of respond to these emails? Yeah. Okay. And is this something which is not available within Freshdesk today?

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  No, not that I've seen. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Because as far as my understanding is, they do have a similar functionality with AI, but no worries. How many people do we have in this team who are sort of managing these or would be part of the next tool that you'll be evaluating?

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  It would just be like one or two users.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And these would be like two of you or some other people. Yeah us… got it. Got it. So you want AI to respond to emails automatically or what exactly do you want from AI, you know, functionality.

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  So we want to make like a knowledge bank or if it's possible like a knowledge bank where we can train enough. And then the AI agent could just respond to all these tickets that's coming in. And for example, at the end of the day, we could go and accept the responses to send them out directly. So while I tried from my demo with the free trial, I saw that the AI could like generate a draft, but I need to put the draft in the email and see it myself. We don't want that we want the AI to automate the whole thing by itself. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That is why I asked you specifically because the thing that you are mentioning is currently not supported within hiver. So it wouldn't be able to sort of give you the drafts ready made for you or ready for you in order for you to just accept. And just, they would be just good to go. Like you mentioned AI today in hiver will help you drafting your responses while you're working on any emails. So that's something that, you know, is going to be there. If you want a tool to automatically respond to emails, there are other tools as well like fixer, I think is one which is a great AI assistant tool that sort of does this. But with hiver, this would be.

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  possible. Excellent. Okay. Thank you for the feedback at least. But yeah, that's what we are looking for currently. So I don't think… if you don't support that kind of tickets management system, it would not be relevant at this time for us yet? Yeah, no.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries let me know in future if there is anything else. Otherwise, you can explore other tools. So I'm sure there are tools which are doing exactly what you're looking for.

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  Yeah, perfect. Thank you for your time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. Thank you bye.

Lasse Gjellestad (lasse@folkekraft.no):
  Bye bye.
