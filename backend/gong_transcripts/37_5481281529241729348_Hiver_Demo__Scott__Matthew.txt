================================================================================

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  hi, good afternoon. It's Matthew. Yes. Hi there. Oh, excuse me. Bless. you. Thank you. How are you this afternoon?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'm good. You know, today is like a super Monday after the holidays.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Yes… I hear you. Yeah, there's a, yeah, definitely a lot of catching up to do if you will. I sense that that's what you're maybe referring to.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah… exactly. And yeah, it just feels like, you know, just trying to get back into the swings of swing of things here, right?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Right. I agree. Just trying to regain our rhythm if you will, because, yeah, with the holidays, it is nice, you know, being able to have those additional days off, you know, so that we can, yeah, just whatever it may be, whether it's shopping, spending time with family, you know, and just enjoying, you know, being in the spirit or essence of the season, however, it's like, yeah, it's that first week, after, it tends to be a little hectic. So hang in there, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And is there anybody else joining from your end today?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  I thought that Rihanna and Scott would be joining us. So let me reach out and actually see. Yeah, no problem. Okay.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  I haven't connected with Scott today. So I'm not sure if he's actually in, I know that Rihanna is… however, I just chatted both of them. So we'll have to see if not, I mean, we could proceed with the, yeah, with the demo. I'm certainly available and interested in seeing what you have to present. I know it's recorded, you know, so… we can always share the recording although I would say that this… solution is, would in essence be for the accounting department. And both Scott and Rihanna, are they're part of the leadership team for the accounting department, whereas I am the director of human resources here at blvd. Residential.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, absolutely. This call is recorded. Happy to share it. And then, of course, you know, if they have more questions or want to set up another call, we can do that as well if they're not able to join today. So the agenda for the call, wanted to just spend the first couple minutes here, just kind of getting more information as far as what you're looking for anything like that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then from there, I can tell you a little bit about hiver and then walk you through the product. Does that sound good?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Yeah, that sounds great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So, yeah. So you mentioned this is for the accounting team?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Yes, this would, I mean we're… looking at this primarily for the accounting team, however, you know, it's nice to have a solution that might actually be uniformly used and applied, you know, across departments or at least other departments that might have a need for it. The accounting team is one of our largest departments. And so that's why… wanting to consider a solution for the accounting team, I can do my best to like explain what… the reason behind it is that a lot of the property accountants, we're a property management company. I don't know if you know that much about blvd residential, but we're a property management company. We manage apartment communities in the state of California, Nevada and Arizona for apartment owners. And so one of the services that we provide is accounting. And so we do have an accounting team and our accountants or the I should say the accounting team, they receive a large number of emails and a lot of those emails are time sensitive. And so we are wanting… to… evaluate solutions that might help our accounting team to better manage their inbox, and then provide leadership with an opportunity to have metrics to see the volume of emails. Perhaps also they currently have a communication sop. So all emails have to be acknowledged within a certain timeframe, you know, have to be resolved within a certain timeframe. So this also gives leadership an opportunity to, you know, see if there are any outstanding emails that need to be escalated or haven't been resolved within the timeframe that are still sitting there. Also if we have… team members that are out on vacation or out on leave, then it allows other team members to actually possibly have access because we do have a vacation, you know, buddy system that we've rolled out. So those are some of the things that come to mind. And so hopefully that was helpful that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Was extremely helpful. And that is exactly what hiver does. So I will show that today, those are the, you know, core features of hiver is to better manage, you know, a large number of emails amongst the team to provide metrics for executives, as far as the volume categories, things like that which I'll show you today. And then also to make sure that they're resolved within those standard operating procedures that they're being answered on time and resolved, making sure nothing's falling through the cracks. And then lastly what it does, is, it gives the whole team access to it. So in the case when people are out, it's anybody else can pick it up very easily. So those are all things that hiver does?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Okay. Great. Yeah, that's great to know. So, is hiver a ticket system or is it something different?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, it is a little bit different. It can be used as a ticketing system, right? You know, really it's just called that. We would just call it a help desk platform. But one of the main functions of hiver, and one of the main reasons that people sign up for hiver is just like you said, you know, they have, they're looking for better email management, right? And, you know, for the instance, for your accounting team, they probably don't need a huge ticketing system, right? Right? They just want a system that can better manage these emails and provide the things that you mentioned. And that is exactly where hiver comes into place. Yeah. So that is exactly where it is. And actually that kind of just like segues me here into hiver here. But basically, yeah, like I said, you know, a lot of people just come, a lot of people come to hiver for, you know, email management, right? To manage, better manage these emails and accounting. A lot of teams. A lot of accounting teams use hiver, but we also have HR teams as well support teams as well. Basically any department that has a shared email address where you're getting a lot of emails and you're looking to better manage it as well. So it can really be for other departments. And then like I said, you know, the reason people like hiver is that it's easy to use as opposed to these other big ticketing systems out there. They're they're clunky, they're slow. It's hard to set up as opposed to hiver, which is very easy, very quick to set up. Okay. And just a little bit about hiver, we do have over 10,000 companies already using us, you know, ranging from small SMB, fast growing startups, all the way to some of the largest global enterprises in the world, and they use us to set up email workflows, respond faster and deliver the kind of support that customers remember. And we've been around since 2017. We've raised over 30,000,000 dollars in funding, over 10,000 companies globally with some of the largest customers being flexport, vacasa, and capital one, just to name a few.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Really, just across all different industries as well. Do?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  You happen, do you happen to know whether or not you have any other property management companies?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we do. We have a ton of property management companies. It's quite popular for us. I don't know any off the top of my head here, but it's a really popular use case for us. Yeah.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  So, that would be something Matthew that, you know, like if we move to the next stage, it would be nice to actually know what other property management companies and whether or not you would be able to put us in touch with them, you know, to, you know, be able to solicit, you know, their feedback because it's nice being able to connect with other, what… do you call it other property management companies like in our industry because, you know, like we have some of the same pain points and so it'd be nice to just be able to converse with them. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I'll definitely look into that as well. So, yeah, I wrote that down property management companies, real estate aligned companies as well. Perfect. Yeah, I actually used to work for a real estate tech company before hiver. It was, it was more for commercial real estate. It's called crexie, if you're familiar with crexie at all?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  I'm not.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. It's more like a online marketplace for commercial real estate.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, yeah, very familiar with the real estate sector here and how many people are in the accounting department that would be using this?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  I want to say just off the top of my head, I believe probably between 25 and 30. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You weren't kidding when you said the accounting department's big. Usually, the accounting departments are smaller than that.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Yeah. They, we have a pretty, I mean, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's a big, it's a big part of your business clearly. Yeah.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Exactly. They happen to have like the, one of the largest departments. I mean, we have a fairly large property management team, but the accounting department falls under the corporate service support department. So it's one of our largest corporate service support departments.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. And you're using Microsoft outlook, Microsoft suite? Yes. Okay. Well, we have a direct integration with that as well.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Good, good. And.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Then just kind of like the Roi that you can expect, with using hiver. Of course, it's we're going to in 10 minutes. I'm going to show you how it can do all those features too. But these are just some kind of the metrics that a lot of our, a lot of our customers can experience, right? Flexport here is just a global freight forwarding company. And, you know, they were struggling with visibility with missed emails across a large operational team. And then after switching to hiver, they achieved full visibility into issue resolution and ensure that no customer messages were ever slipped through within weeks. Their email resolution time improved by 50 percent. They were saving, you know, nearly 387 hours every month. And the best part the entire team was on was onboarded, you know, in just a week in just a couple hours there. Oh, wow. Yeah. And this is just a perfect demonstration of how easy hiver is to use and how hiver can deliver measurable impact in high volume time sensitive environments.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So I'm gonna go ahead and share my other screen here. Now, do you know by chance the accounting team here, do they have a shared email address set up already where people email into they?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Do not, that is something that we were discussing as a possibility right now, each property accountant or ap specialist they're assigned, you know, to specific accounts. And so they're receiving emails, internal emails and external emails directly from let's say our clients or directly from our regional managers. So that's the way it's set up right now. However I will say that other departments including my own, we have a dedicated payroll email, you know, a dedicated HR email, property support training and support. They have their own dedicated email. So there is a possibility of setting that up.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah. And I'm trying to think through it. The only way that hiver is gonna work is if they have an email like that set up.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  I see. Okay. So so that's really good to know. So like as I'm as you're walking me through this, I will just be keeping that in mind that this is, there is a dedicated accounting email set up. So any of our clients or internal partners, you know, like regional managers or directors or what have you, they would, instead of emailing the individual, they would email this dedicated email address.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly like accounting at blvdresidential… com, right? Okay. Yep. And they can set up multiple ones, right? If they have, you know, different, you know, different accounting things, right? So it doesn't have to just be one email if they wanna set up some different channels too. But that is basically the mechanisms of how hiver works is with those shared email addresses because how… on the left hand side, this is hiver by the way you just log in using your Microsoft credentials. And then once you log in, you're going to see these folders on the left hand side, and these folders are tied to those shared email addresses, right? So let's just take operations. For instance, here. Let's just pretend operations was tied to the accounting email, right? Okay. Now, every single time somebody emails that accounting email, it is going to land in this operations folder, and everybody on that team is going to have visibility into it.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Okay, right.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So the point of that being is that, you know, it's no longer going to these individuals individual emails, right? Where it can fall through the cracks. There's no visibility, right? So we needed to go to that shared email address to, so everybody can see it.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  I see. So then if everyone could see it. So… I'm thinking of like a specific. So let's say a client email emails accounting, then everyone could actually see it. And I guess next you're going to show me how it gets… routed? Yep?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. So a couple of things. So once you open the email, you're going to see, this like the… help desk portion of it of hiver right here, the panel on the right hand side and with this panel, you can. So it starts in the unassigned folder. That means that nobody's been assigned it. So basically, it's letting everybody know like, okay, there's two new emails and they need to get assigned out. So first thing you can do is you can assign it to people on your team. If I assign this to, matt gets notified and then the email is going to land in his mind folder. So everyone's going to also have their own mind folder where they can easily manage their own emails that have been assigned to them. That process can also be automated. So we can set it up so that these emails automatically get assigned to the right person as well.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  And so I'm kind of wondering how the automatic assigning works. And the reason is if it's not automatically assigned, that actually means that there would need to be a gatekeeper like someone who is managing the unassigned and actually assigning them. Yeah. And if we don't have a gatekeeper, then it sounds like there's this option of having it automatically assigned. So, if we have let's say I said earlier 25 30 accounting team members, how can we set it up to have the emails automatically assigned to the primary contact?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So there's a couple different ways we can do that. I guess, how does it, do you have any insight into how you determine who works on which email? Is it? I think you mentioned certain people are tied to certain properties. Is that how it works?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Yes. So yes, we, every single email has a property, which basically is an account, right? So there is a property accountant and accounts payable that's assigned to each. There's like a primary person that is assigned to each account.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. Got it. So, and what does your timeline look like by the way for when you wanted something like this set up?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  The timeline for having this set up? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Or like, yeah, or like you wanted to have like a platform like hiver potentially set up?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Well, right now, we're in the early stages of identifying what solutions are available. And Scott recommended that we reach out to schedule this demo because I believe a company that he worked for previously, I'm not sure which one actually used hiver. And I can also say that we're not really interested in having like a ticket system, more of an email management system, but, you know, we don't have a time. We just don't have a timeline right? At this moment because we're just in the early stages of kind of like fact finding just to even see, you know, like what the possibilities are.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Great. Yeah. And the reason I was asking that is basically because we have a lot of new automation features that are coming out within the next month or two. Oh.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  I see.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Which would work perfectly with how you have, your account set up. We would be able to basically how it would work is we would be able to tell… the system on the back end, like with a CSV file, you know, which accounts go to which people or, and then which emails are tied to which people. And then anytime that person emails in it will automatically get sent to that person.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  I see that. Yeah, that would be something that we would be able to manage.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  We would be able to provide a list of, yeah… we would be, we should be able to provide a list of all of our accounts… we have here's. The thing we have 151 accounts. So like we have between 100 and let's say 150 and 155 because we have some off boarding, some on boarding. So then that means that we would have to tell you we'd have to provide you with a spreadsheet of all of the accounts and who they're assigned to. But then it also sounds like we'll have to keep that updated, right? Like as, yeah, like as some on board, you know, off board or if there's like a change, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So there will need to be somebody who will have admin privileges on your end, who would be responsible for updating that. And it's fairly easy to update as long as, you know, as long as it's something that doesn't need to get updated, you know, three times, four times a day, then it's fairly easy and totally possible. We have tons of customers doing that. It would only get challenging if you had to update it. Like I said, like it was constantly changing constantly. These accounts are not too often.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Yeah, I don't think they… I mean we do have new ones coming on board and some off boarding, but I think it's the numbers are manageable and I don't think we're constantly switching accounts around because really we want there to be stability, you know, accountants actually, they get to know the account, you know, and the clients. And so, yeah, I don't think that it's… that there's too many, you know, changes. Perfect. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, what it would look like is something like this and we have different automations you can make. But basically, when an email is received and it's from a certain email, then we want it, you know, from that certain account's email, then we want it to automatically get assigned to this person.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Okay. So now that might be a little bit different. I was wondering if we could do it by location.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  By location, I guess, how would you, so all of our stuff's email related… right? So I guess how do you identify the location on an email?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Okay. So we, oh… that might be a little more challenging because we, the emails actually are our company emails or work emails are by employee. So like we assign each employee a work email. So we have over 300 employees. So let's say about let's just say keep the math, you know, say 325 employees.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Not all employees reach out to the accounting department. So if I'm not mistaken, the individuals that are likely to be reaching out to the accounting department would be the community managers and the regional managers, directors, and above. Okay. But that doesn't include the clients, you know. So that's… got.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  it. So basically, we can work with you on figuring this out. We figured this out with, you know, very large companies. But basically, what I'm telling you is that we just need to figure out ways for us to recognize, you know, which email gets associated to which person, right? So we can do that based off the email coming in. We can do that based off domains as well. If that could be a route, we can also do it off of keywords in the subject or the body of the email, right? So if there's any keywords in it, but, yeah, and then the automation gets kicked off, but we just need a way on our end for the automation to know like, okay, this email just came in and this, you know, this needs to go to Cole because it's associated to this property.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Right. I see. And.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Like I said, we have different ways we can do it by email by domain… and we got a lot more coming as well. So we can figure that out. Okay. Yeah. So that's just something we'll figure out. And then also if you did partner with us, you do get onboarding where we're going to help you set this up. You get a dedicated account manager here. You have a lot of support. So we would help you set this all up, of course. But yeah, we're going to obviously before we partner, we'll figure that out as far as like how we want to figure out the automations. But, yeah. So that's kind of how the automations work there. Okay? And then how are you doing on time? Do you have like another five, 10 minutes here?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Yeah.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Five, 10 minutes. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Me too. So then the other thing you'll see here is this red lightning bolt. So these are the slas standard sops that you mentioned that can be applied to these emails. So it can let us know if you know if anyone's responded to this email within a certain time or if anyone's resolved this email within a certain time, so that's it. And then you can also tag these emails so you can categorize them. So this can, so not, so the executives can not only see the amount of emails that have come in but they can see like what types of emails. So they can say, okay, you know, we got, you know, last month, we got 100 emails about, you know, missed payments or an invoice, et cetera. So there's that. And then there's also a note section down here. This is where they can actually collaborate with each other. So if somebody on the accounting team gets an email, they hit the add mention button. Everyone in the account pops up and they can go back and forwards and communicate with each other, which is fairly helpful. They can also reply to emails directly here. In hiver. We have email templates that can be shared with everyone for those reoccurring emails that they have set up. We also have an AI like chat gpt feature just conveniently in here just to make it like fix the grammar et cetera. And then we also have an AI co pilot which can actually draft replies for them as well. So for teams that get a lot of volume, this is quite helpful. It's going to ask like a three to four prompt question just for accuracy purposes. And then it will actually go ahead and draft a reply.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Oh, nice.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And this part right here, it learns the AI learns from the emails that you're getting, but it also can learn from any documents that you have. So if you have any documents on how you handle things, we can upload those in there and then snippets as well. So it can actually reference different contextual information when drafting up these replies. And then more importantly, so there's that, right? The emails come in, we'll figure out a way to get them routed to the right person, make sure nothing falls through the cracks. And then there's the team view which allows everybody on the team including managers to see all the open emails, right? So these are all the emails that are not finished. They still need to get done. There's 46 open emails. And it also shows you who's working on what. And also in the red lightning bolt here, this is showing us which emails are late. So in this view, I can see all the emails that still need to get done. And I can see which emails are late. And let's just say for instance, here that Cole is out today because he's sick. I can just click on his name. I see all the emails that he's working on. I can see all the back and forwards he's had with this customer. I can see any notes et cetera. And I can work on it. I can reply to it. I can close it out or I can easily take his work and just go ahead and assign it to somebody else on the team.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  OK, nice.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. So this way you can see all the open emails, easily see which emails are late, and then pick up for any employees that are out of office et cetera.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  I see. And then I see that there's escalations. So, is that where it's late? Because the email is being escalated?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We could do something like that. This is, this is honestly just a category that was added to, this accounts, you know, a demo account, but essentially, we can do that. Yeah, where, if it gets violated, it can get escalated as well. So yep. So that way you can see everything here. So then, yeah, the last couple of minutes here just want to show you the analytics.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, in the analytics, you select the mailbox that you want to see… you select the time frame you want to see could be like 30 days, 90 days custom.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And the executives are going to see things like, OK, in the past month, our accounting team got 31, 31 emails this month. I know you're going to be much higher than that, right? And it's up 35 percent from last month. In the past month, we've resolved, you know, 10 emails and you can slice and dice this data however you want. You can break it down, filter it et cetera. But they're going to see from a high level, how many emails they're getting, you're going to be able to see the workload across the team, right? So, how many emails have been worked on by each person? How many emails each person has sent out? The performance of each person? How long is it taking each person to respond to an email? How long is it taking them to resolve an email? And then with the tags which can be applied via automations as well, this will show you like, OK, in the past month, we got, you know, 50 emails on invoice questions, or we got eight emails about, you know, this property, right? So it'll also allow you to see what types of emails you're getting. And then with those standard operating procedures that you want to set up where, you know, people have to respond in a certain time or people have to close out email on a certain time, this will show you how well the team's doing with that. So, how many times did they, how many times this month? Did they, the accounting team not respond in time, right? And it's showing us, okay. 27 people didn't respond in time. And I can even see like who those people were, right? So, Alex here, he didn't respond in time five times this month. And these are the emails where he didn't respond in time? Okay?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Yeah. I was just getting ready to ask if it can be drilled down to the actual employee?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. Yep. You can drill almost every view here. Has that this the analyze view where, yeah, you can drill it down by person… you can even take it even further down as well by employee.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then all this is exportable to a CSV file as well… right? So if I just want to see Alex?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  To just CSV or can… it be imported to other types of files like excel or?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Just CSV? Okay?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You can filter by employees there. It also showed the compliance as well. So like how well we, you know, the good things as opposed to the violations. We can also include customer satisfaction surveys at the bottom of the emails.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Oh, interesting.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And there's the ability to build custom reports or anything custom you're looking to see. And then as I mentioned, this can be exported into a CSV file. You can choose different filters for what you want to see.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  And then.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  there's also the ability to create custom dashboards as well.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  But as the dashboards, the dashboard, will the dashboard just be, I would imagine that the dashboard… is actually for the entire department to see or are there certain access levels that you can actually there's exactly?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There are certain access levels for who can access the reporting and who can't oh,

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  okay. Okay. Good. That's good. Yep. Okay. And so, is there a dashboard per employee?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, like.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Each email address, right? So, like each individual in the accounting department, will they have their own dashboard or is it just like one dashboard? It?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  This, this is a dashboard for this is basically across the department dashboard for more of like, your managers or supervisors to access.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Okay. Yep. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Most of the employees are basically just going to be logging into hiver to answer the emails that have been assigned to them. Gotcha. Okay. You know, right? So you can actually see there's a tab here called assigned to me, so fairly easily, you know, I can come in to hiver every day. I can say, okay, these are the emails that have been automatically assigned to me. These are the ones that are late that I need to work on right away.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Right. And then if something was odd, something, if an email, excuse me was incorrectly assigned to them, they should be able to reassign it pretty.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. Super easy. Yeah, they can just take this and assign it to somebody else or they could even hit that, the direct message button, right? Let's just pretend Cole was my manager be like, hey, this got routed by accident, you know, please reassign. And so I could do it or I can mention my manager, you know, have clear paper trail here. And then the manager can reassign it.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Got it. So it sounds like really the only thing that we would need to work on or consider is the automation.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Totally. Yeah.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Automation, it looks like Scott is actually off today and Rihanna unfortunately was tied up. So I will certainly follow up with the both of them and see if we can get another meeting on calendar so that they have an opportunity to… see this and be able to ask questions, you know, because maybe they may have questions that I haven't… thought of.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Course, of course. Absolutely. Yeah, sounds good. So, I'll email everything to you everything we talked about. And then, yeah, the last thing I'd say is we also offer 24 seven support… instant chat support directly in the account you get goes to a real person here at hiver.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, we'd help with the onboarding, the training of the team setting up the account as well. So you get all of that too. But yeah, we'd love to set up another call here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'll just email you and then if you want to just let me know when for everyone, is it like, are you thinking maybe next week or later this week? What were you, what are you thinking maybe?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Probably next week? OK. Yeah, just with coming back after the.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I know. Yeah.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  After the holidays and everything. Like, I have a feeling that they would like likely be more available next week, however, I can't really speak for them but I can certainly follow up with them to see if they are interested in meeting again this week or if they are open to next week.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  And if so, I can work with them on identifying some dates and times where all three of us are available and I'll probably attend again just so that, yeah, just so that I'm present and aware of, you know, their questions and just kind of sense what their fill is as it relates to. Yeah, this solution absolutely.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I forgot. Are they using quickbooks by chance or Netsuite or anything like that?

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  No, we're using entrata.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Entrata. OK. Yeah.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Entrata. I believe it's ENTR a T a. Okay. Entrata. Yeah. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes. So we don't have an integration with that, but if it was absolutely needed, we can have our engineering team look into it if needed as well. So just a potential possibility. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure how heavily it's needed in these emails, you know, maybe it's not needed too often, but yeah, that's something, we could discuss as well. Yeah.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  I think that it's definitely positive that it integrates, with Microsoft outlook. And so, maybe that's something that we can talk about a little more in our next call, right? Because we're using Microsoft suite and I would imagine the integration there might actually be even more important than the integration with entrata.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Okay. All right. The pleasure meeting you. Thank you so much for your time today, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It was great meeting you. I'll email everything to you and hopefully we'll get something on the calendar maybe next week? Yeah.

Lentice Carter (lcarter@blvdresidential.com):
  Sounds good. All right. Okay. Thanks, matt. Okay. Bye bye.
