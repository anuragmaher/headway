Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's up, Steven?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Hey, how's it going?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Good. So I talked to, I think her name was, let's see what was it pretty?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Pretty. Yeah.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Pretty. Yeah. Okay. So I talked to her yesterday, you know, and to kind of explain to her, you know, look, you know, we have a lot of internal processes in our company that are highly email dependent. One of my goals for going into 20 26 because I've kind of split off and created a new department and my department focuses on architecture and delivery in the company. And part of the architecture responsibility is to start bringing our internal processes into the 20 first century. Yeah, because, you know, our, you know, we are a var, a value added reseller, you know, we deliver technical solutions. We work with, you know, dell, HP, lenovo, all the major oems, we focus on virtualization cloud, you know, security, we, I mean, we have different silos in our division that, you know, architect design and implement solutions. But internally, you know, it's almost like it is back in the nineties with our sales folks relying on excel documents, word, documents that they leveraged as they call forms, but they're not really forms and just highly dependent on email to track it. And, you know, coordinate daily activity which becomes chaotic and it's been a mess for quite a few years. And part of the issue is culture in our environment and resistant to change. So, I've been looking at tools that would number one help use… leveraging AI to help take action items and activities out of the email and leveraging AI, help us, you know, maintain that a little bit better through integrations. And specifically, I was looking at hiver and another email management tool out there. I can't think of the name of it right now. But these two tools to see if it makes sense to introduce, a AI enabled email management tool and integrate on back end of that, you know, kind of like a work like an Asana type thing type solution, right? So that's kind of where I'm at I'm interested to understand a little bit better. You know, what other companies are doing with hiver and how they're leveraging hiver to improve their integrations and integration capabilities are.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's perfect. I appreciate that insight that's super helpful. And just to understand further, Stephen, how are you managing, you know, email communications today, internally, externally, are you leveraging like distribution lists, shared mailboxes?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yeah. We, we recently, in the past year and a half switched over to office 365. Most of our customers or most of our users are E3 few E5 users out there. We have both, right? We have the distribution list that, you know, where you have, you know, accounts, payable accounts, receivable, quote requests, things like that. Some of those are also shared mailboxes, where like the admins for these sales folks have are always monitoring that and tracking, you know, requests that are coming in and it gets, and it gets even further silly because like depending on the admin or the sales group, they want the emails formatted in a certain subject name to track the request. You know, it's just, it's madness. So, so, yeah, I'd say it's definitely a use case, of distribution groups, shared mailboxes, individual mailboxes, and, you know, critical action items that are only being processed in email and tracked via email.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And how many distribution lists and shared mailboxes? Would you say you have within the organization? I?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Can get you that number, but I don't have it right now. So I mean, I'm an admin for our Microsoft 365. Yeah. And they're kind of pull list but I don't have that. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. We don't need the exact number now. Just kind of curious how much you were, I.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Would say probably anywhere when it comes to distribution groups, anywhere probably from 35 to 40. And then when it comes to shared mailboxes, let's say 10 to 15.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. That makes sense. No, this was all super helpful. So just to also quickly introduce myself, my name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiversteven. So I'll just be your point of contact as you're evaluating the solution. But how we, you know, work with clients even as we help them with the management of those shared inboxes, distribution lists, ensuring that, you know, people are handling the workload that's coming in, it's being distributed effectively, nothing slips between the cracks and that we're providing, you know, a great experience whether it's internal or external requests, right? So that's like really where, you know, how we work and how we help companies. So I can share my screen real quick and jump into the demonstration.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Sure. That'd be great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And just kind of show you what we're talking about. So taking a look at my screen here, you know, what's nice about hiver is you're going to log in with your normal Microsoft sso. So we do have that integration where you can just use your current, you know, sso login password to get access to this hiver application. And on the left hand side, there's going to be a couple of different things that's going to help us manage the intake of your communications. The first is the integration with your, you know, outlook inbox, your personal inbox, and then below that is your integrations with those distribution lists, shared mailboxes. So we're going to treat all those as shared mailboxes in the hiver platform, right? To create these collaborative folders for your team to manage and work through. So the assigned to me section is an aggregate of all the shared mailboxes. So as you can see, I'm a part of four distribution lists, HR, healthcare, sales support. This would be an aggregate of all those conversations that's been assigned to me from all those mailboxes or distribution lists. But let's take a look at the support shared mailbox here. For this example. So when I click into this support shared mailbox, it's going to open up sub views beneath it that helps us manage the intake of communication. The first is the mind view everything that's been assigned to me. The next is the unassigned view, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be distributed. And then there's the team view. So understanding, you know, within this distribution list or shared mailbox, what is everyone currently owning on that's outstanding and that needs to be completed? Okay. Just want to pause right here. Any questions so far?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  No, that makes sense?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. So going into the mind, I've been assigned these two conversations, I'll click into this email and we built hiver to be very similar to an email client. So from a learning perspective, you know, just very similar. And on the right hand side, there's going to be a hiver tab that's going to help us manage this communication itself. So on the right hand side, you can see a couple of different things. The first is the assignments. So being able to assign conversations to people that's the first way that we can do that is manually. The next way is a round Robin automation that can equally distribute the emails as they come in amongst the team. And then the last way is skill based routing. So identifying maybe where the domain of the email is coming from, what are some of the keywords or phrases in the subject line or the body of text of the email and then routing it to that specific person.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yeah. I don't think a round Robin use case would really be applicable to us. It would be specific assignments.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah. And that's something we can 100 percent do is create those rule based automations for those specific assignments or cues, right? And then we can track like the status, whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks, you know, with email heavy companies, this just helps them track the volume, making sure that everything's being worked through to a resolution. And then tags. So helpful for creating views, creating folders based on these tags. We can also report on these tags on the backend to understand why people have reached out over a certain time period.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  And so under like activities, do you see like all? Yeah. So it gives you a summarized history of all the activity.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Whatever, what's who's been assigned? The email reassigned tags, applied, slas, applied. These are some notes so you can have internal notes. So right now, I can just be like, hey, you know, matt, can… you help here? And this will live on the conversation like, you know, on this history forever. So it will always be on this thread and you can have conversations on the right hand side.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  And then on the slas that's the other key area that attracted me to this product because, you know, right now, of course, how things are managed, you know, there's there could be a lot of days that go by for a particular request and there's no visibility as to how long that request has been in flight, right? So this would monitor requests and you can create rules around let's say a quote request for and our goal is three days, you know, we can configure a SLA to say new quote request, three day SLA, and if it's not closed, it gets flagged, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. 100 percent. So let's just take let's… actually start with the automations, right? We can create like an automation where it's like, you know, new conversation comes in. We've identified in the subject line of the email that there's the, you know, keywords, billing and quote. We're going to assign this conversation to Rakesh, and then add the tag billing. So this will assign to that user to own this. And then we can also put it to the billing queue for just the general team to be aware that it's there. And then from this automation, we can trigger off an SLA. So it's been applied the billing tag. We're then going to apply this billing SLA trigger for a first response goal of one hour and a resolution goal of 72 hours. If we can't hit these goals, choose who to escalate to.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So kind of that safety net to ensure that things don't slip between the cracks for certain request types and if they do the right people are getting notified and alerted about it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we do have some good analytics as well. So just understanding, you… know, within that distribution list, let's say the support one, let's say we want to see the last 90 days of data. We can see like active new resolve conversations… some of those key performance metrics like average first response time and average resolution time… per user metrics. So emails assigned per user email sent out per user, understanding that workload distribution across the mailboxes, and then the individual performance metrics below. So it's taking me 395 hours to respond to an email. When it gets assigned to me, that's not a good look on my part.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yeah. This is great. I mean, this is exactly kind of what I was looking for because I have tried for years to introduce, you know, like a professional… services automation platform for our company and adoption has just been poor, right? This company, there's people who have been here for years and they're so like stuck on the method of email. So, my focus has now been to change. Okay? I haven't been successful introducing like, you know, like the Trello's the Asana's right? Mondays?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Com, traditional project management, right? Right?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  That's been a complete failure trying to get that into the company. So, I'm like if I can put in a tooling platform that would not really alter the way that they're doing their work today, but yet give us the visibility to quickly identify where we're not hitting our marks. We're not turning around quotes fast enough, you know, and providing those metrics that you were just reviewing without having to alter the way they're doing their work. That's the benefit of this, you know?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly exactly like they will be working out of this like hiver application. But again, it's like very similar to an email client. Yeah. And it's making their job easier to track their tasks too.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. It is because today, they have multiple mailboxes in their outlook client and they don't really have visibility like you would here as like a dashboard. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And how many people would be like using something like this at the company?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  So here's what would have to happen, right? I'm very much interested… in hiver but I don't have the internal time and resources to do this under like a free POC. It would take me probably about three months to architect how hiver would work with my team first. And my team is newly created and I got an open fte out there for a senior principal architect to be hired by the end of the year. So my team is going to be two people starting this year, three people next year including myself. And then I would implement this tool with my team first. And then I have to sell it to the other teams. I have to figure out, you know, how this tool could benefit our pre sales team, which would be, you know, about people and how this tool would benefit our pmo team and then our finance and sales team, right?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  So altogether, if I can get full adoption in the company, we would probably be around 45 50 users, but I have to do that methodically and I have to sell it to the company because everything that we do at eastern, the first thing I'm asked is, how does it make us money? How do we save money or how does it make us money? So I would like to start off with like two license month to month for about the first three months so that I could work on this tool, you know, and build the workflows and build it to how I want to use it with my team and my request.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yeah. And then as I get comfortable with using the tool, you know, I'll start to build the use cases for the other teams and explain to them how this tool has saved me time, how it has enabled me to deliver faster and to bring visibility into csat issues and build those use cases for the other team to get their adoption and get it implemented. Because, because at the end of the day, you know, I, like I said, for two and a half years, trying… to put in a psa platform has just not been feasible because I can't get the people's mindset of, hey, I work in email. This is easier to do an email. I'm like, OK, if you want to stick to email, that's fine. I'll find something that's going to give you the email look and fill, but give us the ability to track and report.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. OK. No, I think that's a good idea kind of build out that proof of concept, Roi value proposition of hiver over the next three months. I also have a resource that you can work with who can help you with this. You know, over that time period, who, you know, I'm sure, would, you know, love to make sure you're driving towards success.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yes. Yeah, that would be 100 percent appreciated because I do know in order for the features that I'm looking for, it would be the pro version. Yeah. And, and so when it comes to integrations, let's say that, let's say I am successful down the road to implement a more robust psa tooling. And what about the integration capabilities with hiver and a tooling like that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we do have an open API. So we have the ability to create custom integrations and we do have some out of the box ones as well. So let me just let's… look in here.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Because I think the integrations is only available in the pro version.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes. So the integrations are only, for some reason, I don't have them permission on this, but I can send you a list of the integrations that we have after this. There's not permission. Yeah.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  That's fine. Yeah, that's totally fine.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But we also do have, the capability to create custom integrations as well. So if there's a system, you know, that you'd be looking to integrate with that's not on like the app list, like we can scope stuff out as well.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yeah. I do know that we integrate today with Netsuite as our primary service sales tracking tool. And connectwise is another one we use because we work through a distributor Ingram for all of our solutions that we sell. So I have to kind of better understand the workflow, but that could be the potential integrations needed up front. And then, you know, the future integrations, I would just see what you're what your capabilities are, and then probably evaluate tooling based on the capabilities of hiver. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. No, that makes sense. And then you mentioned also AI too. So I wanted to touch on some of what we have to offer now in our roadmap. Sure. Do you have the ability to like generate like replies using knowledge base articles, information that we feed it. So using an AI co pilot to draft responses with internal documentation that you feed it, which then we can, you know, put it into the conversation itself.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yeah, that's yeah, I was looking at that feature. I think that's definitely going to be one of those options that's going to take quite some time to build out. Yeah, very cool. Yeah, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, you know, we just have the general classic, you know, AI compose and then AI summarization, if you want to get up to speed on the, you know, threads really quickly.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yeah. And that's another great option too that AI summarization.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, cause sometimes email threads can be, you know, really long it can, you know, waste a lot of time. It'll just get you quick to the points driving efficiencies.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yeah. So, you know, I think my script subscriptions expired again.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  I don't see like the ability, to just like most of the time when you're when you have a product like this, you go to your subscription management, put in a credit card, subscribe month to month, you're done. But, with the high versus contact sales. So, what is my next step to activate to license month to month?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I'll actually let's do this right now since we're on the call, I'll just create a contract real quick for a month to month commitment. And then what we'll do is once you sign it, we'll send you over an invoice for a monthly rolling contract.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Okay. All right. So you guys do it kind of more the E signature, and then separate billing for outside of the tooling. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Cause we do like, we do want to speak with our clients as well to ensure that we're pointing them in the right direction, answering any outstanding questions and like stuff like.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  That understood? Yeah. I think, the pro version, is good and I think it's what? 55 dollars per user per month? Yeah?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, it'd be 110 bucks per month, you know, on a rolling monthly contract?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  And then if I can't if I do decide to cancel because I can't get adoption… you know, well, I'll be able to come down to a decision point either a, I, I'm just being transparent here. Path number one, the tool works great for my team and it brings me value. I would keep the tool regardless even if I had to eat the 110 dollars because if it makes my life easier and improves my performance workflow, it's worth it. If I can't get adoption for, from the company, I'll just keep, my two user license and eventually a three user license next year. So that's path option number one, path option number two is that, you know, I, I'm successful in getting this sold into the company, and we keep growing it month to month and possibly switch from monthly to an annual contract for a broader group of users to save that 20 percent… possible. Path number three is that it doesn't really fit the eastern culture… and I have to cancel. If I have to cancel, is it a 30 day notice to cancel or is it effective immediately?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, it's, it'll be a 30 day notice cancel?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Okay. And on path number two, if I am successful in expanding this into the other teams, can we switch from monthly to annual?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent. So, if like this is something we want to expand out across the company, we can work towards an annual contract in.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Terms. Okay, awesome. Yeah. Then send me over the, I'm assuming the contract will be sent over to me via email, accept it and, get it rolling because, like I said, I, you know, I'm excited to kind of build this out and, cause I think it's going to really be a game changer, without having to change the culture here at eastern.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, I think so too, and you'll have some good resources as you're testing as well. You'll have access to, you know, an account manager as well as, our technical support team, who's available? 24 seven, three six five. So, as you have, if you have any workflow questions, integration, questions, things of that nature. They'll be able to assist you?

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  All right, perfect. That sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, I, actually, I can send this to you right here. I'm about to create this one second.

Stephen Blake (stephenblake@ecei.com):
  Yeah, it might be a little bit later this afternoon before I actually execute and pay for it and all that stuff. Cause I do, got a call coming up here at three 30.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So, I'll just shoot this over to you via email and then, yeah, we'll just get the ball rolling. All right. Sounds good, man. Appreciate the time. Thanks, Stephen. Take care. All right, bye.
