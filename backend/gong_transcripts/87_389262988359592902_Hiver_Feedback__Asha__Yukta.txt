Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  so, everything, it is going… from Lina itself. So this is like, because before, also, we have worked in fresh test. So I feel like it is similar to the fresh test. This is basically about the ticket management.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Absolutely.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah. So only for the ticket management. If you are going for the first time, then I think like this will be more useful to us. So actually we are looking for something more advanced than Lina AI. Okay? So that is the reason this is also be there in our queue because our first preference is like the email management only. I will keep it in my priority list also. But I think like further, we will review other tools and technologies then I think like I will get back to you as soon… as possible. Okay? In case, if we are taking this also. Yeah. And the Monday com integration and sap integration is also there, right? So that is also, you said that you will check and come back to me?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes. I mean Monday. Com and sap is something that we can do. So that is not a problem at all.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That is something that we have as native integration. So we can achieve that. The problem was just with the chatbot, like if you could replace it from current whatsapp, wherein you could reply through the AI agents. I think that was missing. And I think the form that you showed me on Monday that you were going to create as well?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  These two things. I mean, if you are like you yourself said like if you are looking for a ticketing software to just emails and incoming traffic there, I think, yeah, for that, it is too little work. And for the AI agent, I know that you are not looking for a like a live chat, but to integrate it within your ATS that you are using so that you can easily refer and get answers. I mean we can set that up there. Also. It is up to you where you want to set up the live chat. And then whenever someone reaches out or asks any question, we will be coming up with the AI agents as well, wherein through AI agent, the first answer that a visitor get or if I ask something as per what you feed into the AI, it will sort of be able to answer on behalf of a human. So that is something that is still in place that we are working on and we will be launching it also very soon.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That will be covered. But for the forms and customer portal is something that I checked from the product team as well. That unfortunately will not be supported at this point at least.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Because why we are getting into the chatbot, whatsapp in the sense like most, probably because not most, probably almost all the members will be using whatsapp right? It is easy for them to. So you wanted it, whatsapp… chatbot?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, the chatbot, you wanted whatsapp only and not anywhere else?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah, only in whatsapp? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, that is not going to be possible then. Yeah, I thought you want chatbot otherwise to be there as like a live chat?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  No live chat. It will not work here because we cannot put respective person to sit and do the chatting. So, and also, it is Saudi based, right? Saudi based in the sense, we are also looking for Arabic conversation also over whatsapp?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. Yeah.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  That is also there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, no worries. I think Asha, let me know. Whatever the feedback is. You can always reach out to me on the email if anything changes. And if it aligns with what you're looking for, we can always reconnect at that point.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah, sure. Sure. Definitely. I'll reach out to you. So any, which ways it is there in my queue also. So, if only for ticketing management, then we can think about it. So, because my management is like they wanted to go beyond what we have currently, right? So that is the reason, no problem. Any, which ways, nice talking to you. No worries.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Pleasure talking to you as well. Asha and I'm so sorry, I could not join initially. I think I did join, but there was, I could just couldn't get into the meeting. So I had to change the meeting link. And then I was no.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Problem.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No problem. Anyway. Thank you for the update. Yeah, take care.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Take care. Yeah. Bye bye.
