Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  morning?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  How are you doing?

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  I am well rested. I woke up about 30 minutes ago. Oh, fantastic. Yes, Mondays tend to be my late day. So, these are usually, I get started a little later in the day. Lewis Cox was not on the invite for this call. I think after it got updated, can you send him an invite? He may or may not be able to join? But I want to make sure because it's even earlier for him.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Sure. Bear with me a second. I'm just going to go ahead and send an invite.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Miles most likely won't be joining because he is traveling today, right?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So, Lucas, this call, I mean, while we had discussed previously, right? That we would be starting with your account set up and onboarding, but I believe there has been a slight disconnect when it comes to what is currently available with your hiver subscription, and what is not, if you had a chance to look at the email communication?

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Yes, I took a little bit of review there. I mean, as I mentioned last week, I have been swamped,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  No worries. I'm just going to give you a, you know, a one liner summary here. So, we had discussed, right? That, if you receive emails in your personal inboxes, there is a possibility to automate that and bring it to your shared mailbox, right? So, now, that is a functionality that is available on elite, right? That we had also discussed on the call. But having said that, I think there was some communication, wherein this was not perhaps discussed prior to this. So, what I, what we've decided internally is that Cole, who happens to be our accounts manager here, and he was the one who was, you know, leading this, the sales conversation from hiver side. He has joined the call today, and he would want to have this discussion with you to explain exactly what is part of your hiver subscription, and what isn't, so, you know, we're all on the same page. And of course, this call is being recorded. So, you know, we're all on the same page and we are all aware of, what's available, what is not, what are the next steps forward? So, before we get started with the onboarding account creation, et cetera. We thought maybe it would be better to clarify any doubts or any questions that you might have. So having said that, I'll take a step back here, Cole, Lucas over to you guys. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  What's going on? Lucas? How are you?

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  I'm doing well. Like I mentioned, we're a small shop here. So we get, very busy periodically in the last month has been, and by a small shop, I think we're two to 200, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  So, we handle a lot. So I think a big part of what may have happened was the, was that first word which is automation of independent to shared inbox, which may have been misunderstood as implies there is a, manual approach?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, there is. So that's where I think the disconnect was. I thought you just needed the ability to manually assign it. And those one off cases is to the shared mailbox. You still have that capability to do that. If you need to pass things through the shared mailbox, if someone reaches out to you individually. So like you can still do that through that function, you just can't do it through the automation, side of it. And I think from my side, so, when you reached out to me, being like, hey, we're going to, you know, go forward with the grow plan. I thought you growth plan. I thought you were aware of that, that's my fault for not clarifying this further. And I apologize for that. But what kind of makes the most like, is the automation a must have or is it more like for one off situations when you want to push things to a shared mailbox?

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  So when pushing, I just need more information on how that flow works. Cause, the biggest component of why we're looking for a solution is, for I don't know the past couple of years, the company started expanding in terms of our tech team and tech stack. So things like emails used to live heavily in both personal and shared inboxes. We have customer relationships that run many years. They have essentially built relationships with specific people now, which is great for business. Bad for KPIs and visibility. Because what is in John smith's inbox is not visible to anybody other than John smith. So if John smith goes and takes time off, nobody can be stamped to do those communications. If John smith retires and he's got a customer that he's built a relationship over for 10 years and they email him and he's no longer working there. They may not know where to go. They get that bounce back email. This account doesn't exist. Da. And that can ruin the customer relationship.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Now, we can address that with email mappings and all that stuff and setting up outbound rules, but it's those kinds of things. The visibility into inboxes is really the main thing. And I think when we were evaluating the plan, the difference between the growth and elite plan in terms of relevance for us is a single feature. It's a 60 dollar a month price bump.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. For the.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  One thing that we need now, it's one of those ones that… we do need it. But like what does the automation do? Is that everything? And I think that's one of those like a tech demo on the difference between the two would also help.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I can give you just like a difference right here. So the manual way to do it, right? Just sharing my screen. Actually, I think that's the wrong screen there. Okay? Perfect. So one way you can add it to the share mailbox and this is included in your plans just clicking on this and choosing which mailbox you want to add it to. So right now, I'm in my personal inbox. So you can just click into here and go. You know, I'm going to add this to support let's say, and now it's living in that support share mailbox for the entire team visibility. And then the other way that it works, Lucas is through the automation where it's like, you know, if any time walmart, com reaches out to you individually, Lucas, it's going to automatically push it to the share mailbox.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Okay. So that would be like external domains pushing in, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Looking for client domains, us identifying them, and so ensuring that every time they reach out to someone personally like you're getting that visibility and stuff like that. And it sounds like that is the direction you'd want to go. Because like you said, if people are out of office, you know, they maybe can't be there to manually add it from their mailbox. So, I think the pi to SM is definitely the more beneficial one.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  It is also like it's incredibly important. I mean, that's pretty much like lock stock and barrel the whole reason we started shopping for a platform.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. 100 percent.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Because.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  so, I actually have like a proposal for us here. I did speak with my team. I let them know about this situation. We're not going to three extra costs that's just you need one feature, right? It's just the one feature you need in the plan. So, essentially, you're paying 35 dollars per user right now, we would just ask to go to 45 dollars per user. So just an increase of 10 dollars per user. And that's going to give you the whole kit and caboodle as well. So you're getting the whole platform for that.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Okay. So that would be basically the entire elite platform for 45 dollars. So I can clarify.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly 45 dollars per seat. You're paying 35. Now, it would just be 45 per seat going forward.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  And that's pro rated for indefinite or?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we can sign if you want to sign like a long term contract, we can do that as well or if you want to, just like for now, I think we can go to month for 45 dollars per user per month and then work towards a longer relationship. Once you deem it, you know, valuable.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Yeah. So if we have product fit, we can revisit and then look into a long term contract.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. One year, two year, three year, like, I think this is a good path forward for us like, you know, let's minimize the increase in license costs or just bumping you up 10 dollars per seat instead of bringing you up to, you know, what was it? 99 dollars per seat? Per month? It's.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  90 95.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 95. So, yeah, we're not going to do that like we, you know, we understand that you're a startup, you know, you have a lot going on. So, we want to do best by you as well. Like we're not just going to like increase prices like crazy.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  And, I could definitely get that, I can almost certainly get that one approved at 45 dollars. It's, especially. And the big thing is as well, we'll also have time to get product fit because that's a big one with us is user adaptation and onboarding is… because we're such a small shop. It could take a while.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So, like, I think this is a good path forward like so I can reach back out to my support team just to be like, hey, like we're going to upgrade you to the elite package, and then put you at that 45 dollar per user per month cost, you know, once we deem this a fit, like, you know, you want to move forward for a longer relationship, we can start talking about longer term contracts.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  All right. Yeah, I think that will definitely solve our problems, okay? Because that's one of those ones that's wait because we have another, we have a whole platform we use for ticketing. So we would then be ballooning costs exponentially.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  right. Right. Yeah. No, that's the last thing we want to do here.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Yeah. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, should I reach out to my support team to ask them to upgrade you to the elite at the 45? I think I would just need your written confirmation and then we'll be good to go.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  If you can write that up especially with the, long term lock in reevaluation at a later date. I don't know, set that like six months out.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So, I'll send you over an email being like, hey, like, you know, we're going to give you the pi to SM automation like we're just asking for 45 dollars per user per month, you know, and then, you know, you'll maintain at that price rate as we work towards like a long term relationship.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, I can send that all over in, a detail message after that.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  All right. And then I will get Lewis and Miles because I am the it Guy, I deal with setup configuration and training. They're a bit more on the finance heavy side. So I can definitely say that I've been working with them for a while. I don't think the 10 dollar price bump will be an issue. But so I'll talk to them after this, Lewis. Unfortunately, and Miles both couldn't be here. Miles… is traveling. Okay? He lives on planes. So, if you can do that and then just send us a formal document of some sort. We can look at going ahead.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. And then, does it make sense for you to continue the setup call with udita today or should we just like kind of reconvene once we have this all squared away?

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Does the setup process change between the two?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Platforms, the process is not going to change. Sorry to jump in like that, but we only have like another three odd minutes here. So might not. I think, let's wait and connect another day or something, if that's okay. I,

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  think that would probably be best because, I mean, you're how our introductory call went. I do have a question because, you know, our calls are going to run a little long next time because we're going to need to catch Lewis up. And all that, calls around this time are probably like the earliest. And when I was looking at your schedule, do you usually have anything that's, longer or a little bit later?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I can offer you longer, on Thursday and Friday, a little bit later. Unfortunately, I work eastern times, so it's going to be a little challenging there.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Yeah, because, I'm on the east coast myself. Lewis is on the west coast. So, and I, just, when I was looking at your schedule, they kind of like stopped around like 11 a. M, and I don't know if that was, just you were full or if that's where you stopped your business hours.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. About, I'm okay to accommodate till about maybe, one, one 30, one 32 P. M, east eastern if that works.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  All right. Yeah, I mean, that would be, that would be great for us. Like I said, I work a lot of, you know, the Asia desk as well. So, super… early days start turning into 16 hour days, very quickly. Oh, God, I,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I think you mentioned that on the last call, yes.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  And… Monday is, you know, because Asia slash Australia, Monday is our Sunday. So, Monday is kind of like catch up because, everything has to be queued up. Otherwise, you don't have a full work week. You don't have a full work week anyways.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Completely understand that. Completely. Understand that Lucas, I was thinking how about let's do it this way. Now that, Cole and you have had a chance to discuss this, and we have more or less an agreement on the way forward. You will be receiving an email from us. Cole, will you be sending that email, today?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. I can shoot that out today with all the details.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. So, Lucas, in that case, once, Cole sends the email, then perhaps yourself, Lewis and Miles could take a look, let's give it a day and, once we reach an agreement, all parties are in agreement today's, Monday, let's give it Tuesday. Maybe we can set up a call for hiver setup, et cetera, on, Wednesday or Thursday. What do you think?

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  That should be good. Wednesday, Thursday. It all comes down to scheduling. But… I handle a lot of stuff. I can get approvals and things if needed. So, I hate to speak for other people's schedules when I haven't looked at them.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Trust me, I.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  I have always, I'm always above and beyond considerate when dealing with scheduling, because, you know, an empty calendar slot does not mean somebody's not working.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, 100 percent. Yes, yes.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  It's not. So, yeah, I don't see that being an issue, later this week, I'll make sure that is, reviewed as quickly as possible. And then we can just, you know, I don't think it'll be an issue, but, you know, in an off chance, it is, we'll have a decision where we're another by the end of the week.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  No, absolutely. We completely get that. So, in the email that Cole will send you, I shall include my scheduler link as well so that you have ready reference to my calendar and, you know, whenever yourself, Louis, Miles, you know, whoever's responsible and, required to be part of the setup call whenever you guys are available, it could be just yourself also, you know, we don't have to have everyone on the call and that's when we can go ahead and set up your account, set up the mailboxes at the users and so on. So we can get started that way. Yeah.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Yeah, that sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Perfect. And apologies for this confusion, Lucas, this is like the last thing I ever want to do. Like I always try to be as transparent as possible, with everyone I work with. So, I appreciate, you know, your guys' understanding and, you know, hopefully this is just a low enough cost increase, to give, you know, the whole hiver platform. That is going to be worth it for y'all.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  I think, I mean, like I said, I think it's reasonable. I mean, at… this price plan, price point, it's I think it solves 45 dollars a month worth of problems in my mind. So… but again, I'm not in customer service, so I don't know, right, right? But, yeah, so, no, I think this will be a nice little mid ground for us to work off of, and go from there.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Awesome. Well, no, it was, great to, you know, reconnect with you, Lucas. I'll send over those details right after this, and we're, we're looking forward to getting y'all up and running.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  All right. Sounds good. Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Take care guys.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Thank you so much both for your time. Appreciate it and have a great rest of your week. Take care now.

Lucas Hearn (lucas@shopharbour.com):
  Would you bye, okay, bye?
