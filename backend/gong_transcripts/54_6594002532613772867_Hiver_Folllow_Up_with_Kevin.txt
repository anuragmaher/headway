Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Kevin. How you doing?

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Hello, all good, Matthew. How about you doing?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Well, doing well. And I also have minaj on the line too. He can just help out with any product questions you might have. But yeah, just wanted to see how the trial is going, see if you had any feedback so far.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  So far is really good. I've been using the digital tool to get everything organized. So it's working out pretty well. I already got the hang of it, changing the views and looking up all my pendings. It's easy to make up reports whenever I go to the closed ones under my tag. So I know which things I really took care of and could give like a brief to my boss of what was done today and also even like a rundown of pending stuff for tomorrow. So that's pretty useful. Also there's the team, I got two of them already working with this.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  And today, I'm going to like do a walkthrough of everything because they only, you know, like get to the exec shared inbox that's it. So I would like to go over all the features and how to set it up correctly. So they see it friendly. I will have this meeting like in an hour, I think. And I would like them to adopt this system. So so far, I've only been using the assigned buttons, status update and notes. Whenever I need to mention someone in a thread, they'll get this email under their mind folder. The other thing is they already made up some tags. We could put more subjects on each email. So far. We have only set four. I told them we could automate this by putting up some rules, but I don't know. I don't remember if this was in the free version and they all got that notification that the trial.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  The free trial is ending today. So we would have to sign up to any tier. There's a free tier as well. And I told them depending on what are we going to use to end those. So that's it. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So, yeah. So then we have the different tiers… would recommend at least the growth package. So basically the, you know, the free one is very limiting.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  You.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  basically, you can't really use tags in it.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  You.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  know it's free for a reason. So I would recommend at least the growth package there's an annual or a monthly plan. So if you just want to keep, you know, if you prefer the flexibility of month to month, you can do that or there's the annual plan as well. Some of the things that we talked about such as the slas and the reporting are all part of the pro plan. And with the pro plan, you also get, you know, onboarding help as well. We still have 24 seven support, but those are kind of the benefits here. So I would really recommend either the growth or the pro.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  All right. What are the limitations in the free version? Like what of what we're doing right now, is… locked behind the growth or any tier?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it's actually all listed on our pricing page here. But let me see here. So the main thing is the usage limits you can only have on the free one, you can only have one tag. So you can't have multiple tags. You can only set up one email template. You can only connect one shared inbox, which I'm not sure how many you have. Is it just one?

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Yeah, we have another one, but it's from an external domain, like another company. I don't know if we can bring them in but it's another one that they are using, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Now, oh, okay. So that's it. And then, so you can only set up like one tag and, there's no automations.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  All right. Can we go over the top of the list?

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  And I.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  can actually, I'm going to put this in the chat too. So, you can have it on your screen too. You can look through it after the call if you want or share it with them?

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Great. Perfect. All right.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But… I would say those are pretty much the big things here is just the amount of inboxes, you only have one. So that's fine. But really the limitation with tags and automations.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Yeah. All right. Okay. So what happens after, the trial ends?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It'll just suspend the account.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Got it. And like if I want to run it for another week with the whole team under the free version, go to the sign up button.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, if you want to convert it to the free version actually just shoot me an email.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Got it. And.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'll have them convert it to the free version.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Yeah, because they haven't used it that much. The only one who has like in the whole thing, it's me and that's why I was going to do the walkthrough today and get them involved into using just this for the week… and then move to Chrome. I think.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So what I can do is actually, I'll just go ahead. I'll get, you can keep using the paid trial. I'll go ahead and get it extended for you. The best I can do is until February fourth. Perfect. That's.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  great. It works.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, yeah, you can keep testing it with them now that you have it in the account. You should be, it should, if you refresh, your hiver instance or Gmail, it should be updated.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  All right, bless you. Thank you. All right. After, after I send the link and they go over… you know, running, the extension. How did I change the view under? When whenever I go to share the inbox, and I want to just see closed pending and all views, remember?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Can you share your screen? Yeah.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  So, before it was just this three unassigned mine and team and you added this three? Yeah, how do.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You get, what, how?

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Do, how do I get them to display this got?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It got it. So you go back there.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  All right. Let me go all.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Click all views, you see under pending all views?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You see how you have stars? The stars, the star is yellow next to close and pending. Yeah. So that's how they do it. They'll have to click all views and then star all of.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Them. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, they see a little bit different views than you, but, yeah, they'll just need to do that if you want them, to see those as well.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Oh, I can make new views, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And you can also make your all your own views. You can make new views as well. Yep. Based on tags.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  All right. Okay. Perfect. That's the thing, I wasn't doing before this also.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  These are open and tender. All right. How do I say this?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Upright save as, yep. All right. And just call something. And then before you hit save before that, you can see, you want this visible to everybody on your team, right?

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Oh, okay. All right.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, you want to click so that now it's only visible to you to.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Me. Yeah. All right, perfect. And if I go back, you'll be displayed here. All views in here, right? And I have to start it to have a, I think we need to do it… maximum. O… okay. I have to eliminate one… and then get it fixed… there. It is… perfect. Is there any way to get more views here? Or I just have to go to all views and manage it from there, right? That's.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  the best way, yeah, that's the best way. Yep.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Got it. Okay. That's something I missed that last time. I think they're going to like this. Any other thing I'm missing there? Like we need something here that hiver set up. Wait, no, and I really don't… or it was just like first time for visibility, we were new here. What's the roles are we already set up?

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Here's where I add more users. Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  So far that's it, we have the rules and automations that we haven't done yet… but that's it. Okay, good. I'll talk to them today like half an hour, I think, and I'll let you know, okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Yep. And like I said, I extended it for you until February fourth, so you can keep testing this out. And, yeah, you could actually purchase directly in the account when you're ready. Also. Yeah, you or anyone on your team can talk to anybody on our support team. In the meantime. If you have any questions with automations, how to set things up? Any issues at all? Our support team will talk to you 24 seven.

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Yeah, I tried it yesterday. One of us of the team tried to run it yesterday, and they told me that after clicking on the Chrome extension set up and loading up the Gmail, it started crashing. And after talking with the support team, they gave me like a direct link and I shared it yesterday. We're going to try it today. That's why I was wanting to go over the setup or things they might have to do at the beginning… like just after you click on the link, but yeah, if I need any help, I would just go to my chair.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Yep. Awesome. Kevin. Well, then you're all set? Let me know if you or the team have any other questions?

Kevin Chavez (kevin@buildqm.com):
  Perfect. I will. Thanks.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, thanks. Bye.
