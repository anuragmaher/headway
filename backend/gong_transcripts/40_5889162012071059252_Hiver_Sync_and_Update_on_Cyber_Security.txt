MXS10:
  hello?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Marco. Good morning. How are you doing?

MXS10:
  Yeah, not too bad. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well. Thank you for joining me sir.

MXS10:
  No problem. So still don't have cyber security clearance. We chased them a couple of days ago and chased them again this morning. Don't know what the issue is. Have you had any contact with them? Have they been in touch with your guys?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, I did look at everything. I could even see if they're directly contacting anyone of our support or it, which I could not find. So, I don't think I've got any conversation with regards to the security or compliance as such. Okay?

MXS10:
  When I try tomorrow, then I'll just chuck into the conversation that if they're just doing it as a desktop exercise, using the access stuff, the records and things that you provided through those links that's fine. Okay. But if not, then I'll just drop in that, you know, if there's supposed to be some communication, how come two weeks later? There's not even been a questionnaire or something sent out?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. I understand. And otherwise, I mean, even if you happen to talk to them and should they want to be introduced to hiver, info security, you can just maybe introduce them to me. I'll put one of my security officers in line and they can have a direct questionnaire. But yeah, if these are just those regular questions on basis of security and privacy documents that I've shared, most of the customers are able to find their answers and everything onto it. But yeah.

MXS10:
  I suspect it's just a case that they haven't actually started doing anything with it yet. I think that's the issue. So I'm copying, you know, the CHRO, and everyone that was on the original decision. I'm just copying them in on everything I'm sending. So at some point somebody's going to realize they're next on the block, so they'll make that decision.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. All right. No worries. Can I move ahead? This meeting on to next week? And we reconnect maybe on tenth or eleventh by Monday or Tuesday?

MXS10:
  I wouldn't do the Monday because I'm not sure that there's going to be much progress by then. Let's say Tuesday?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. And how about the same timing just for 10 minutes, quick check up?

MXS10:
  Yep. That's fine.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. I'm going to be sending an invite real quick and if I hear back from anybody in your company, from your company, and with regards to the, it or compliance, I'll let you know, yeah.

MXS10:
  Just.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  give me a.

MXS10:
  Message or something. That'd be fine and that at least tells me and especially if there is somebody, if you can give me the name, then I can.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Ask everyone.

MXS10:
  Else and just contact them and say, really appreciate your help. You know, when do you think this is going to happen?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Definitely. I have already flagged this account. Noatum logistics one of those favorite accounts at this point in time that I'm talking to. If I hear back from anybody in your team, I will definitely let you know and have contacted otherwise, I'm expecting you to even have a quick talk internally and see if there's anything that's stopping them. They need more assistance. We're right here for the assistance.

MXS10:
  Yeah. And if I get anything today or tomorrow, I'll ping your message right away.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Definitely. You've got my email address. Feel free to write back. We are scheduled to catch up next week. There is an invite already sent out to you. You can go ahead and accept that. Please. Thanks very much. Have a good day. Thank you. All right, Marco. Thank you so very much. I look forward to talking to you again. You take care bye.
