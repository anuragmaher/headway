Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's up, Ken?

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  All's good, my man. How you doing not?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Bad. Where are you based out of?

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  San Luis obispo. Have you ever heard of it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, where's that.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  So, if this is San Francisco and this is la, it's literally smack dab in between two and a half hours from boat, right on the coast.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, awesome. That's a good spot to be.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Yeah, cannot, you know if you got an extra 1,000,000 dollars lying around, I can't complain, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, my goodness. But I appreciate, you know, hopping on though, Ken. So just to set a quick agenda and hop into it, would love to do a quick round of introductions… understand your role kind of what got you interested in hiver, then we can jump into a product demo and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps. But I can introduce myself first. My name is Cole miller, senior account executive here at hiver, been in the email management, customer experience space for over six years. And yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can help y'all.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Awesome. I love a concise man. But so, yeah, it's funny. I'm the co founder and CEO of a new product meetsona, it helps you figure out what makes you unique and create a week's worth of LinkedIn content with 110 minute interview. So super simple, you know, taking my experience of like running and selling to SEO agencies and just kind of into one product. And the reason I reached out is pretty simple one, we don't have a customer support solution in the product and my co founder is thinking through building it. And I'm thinking through what can be fast, easy, cheap and insightful to help our customers in the short term. And just as I was thinking about that, this is the second thing on LinkedIn. I got this little pop up that said get a gift card or something for a demo. And then I checked your site. I have no clue beyond that, you do something related to support or experience. And so it's an easy yes for me for the demo. And our conversation today. Is that insightful?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, that's perfect. That gives me some good background there. So currently not using anything today. From a customer support perspective, you're just managing it all from like an email inbox or how are you kind of managing support today?

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Yeah, we launched to the public, what 29 days ago. And so I just have basically a link to my email in the bottom right hand modal that says like ship me this email and I'll get back to, you know, because I have time, right? Very unsophisticated.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And just kind of curious, are you leveraging Gmail or outlook today?

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Gmail? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Gmail. Okay. So I can give you a little background of hiver here, Ken, kind of how we differentiate the market and, you know, how it functions. So I'll hop into that. Now, feel free to stop and ask any questions kind of as we're going through it and just curious how big is the company today? It's like what? Like five to 10 people, you guys are just getting off launch?

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Two people. And as of today, only one paying customer. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. So we do provide Ken a customer service platform that lives within the Google workspace. So, if I click on the admin panel here, we have different channels like email chat, whatsapp voice, knowledge base, customer portal. And then this is where we'll create integrations, leverage AI, service level agreements, automations, and all that stuff.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  So, I mean, that is really slick. I didn't realize it was native to the inbox. Yeah. Who knows? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It's a cool product because a lot of people are just already in Gmail, right? They're invested in the Google workspace. So just why not just make it even easier and consolidate it under one roof?

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Very cool.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, so that's the admin panel, then you have the channels on the left hand side. So, you know, email support, whatsapp chat phone, but we turn emails into tickets that is like our foundation. So clicking into the unassigned here, this is where we can do things like assign conversations, track the status, whether it's open pending or closed track custom fields and data, and then also collaborate on the side of the conversation.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  So, in theory, I could have a field that's like has a happy emoji, a sad emoji or neutral that the customer doesn't even get populated here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that's our AI sentiment analysis that shows whether the client is happy or unhappy. Cool. So that's kind of like the gist of it though we offer a couple of different plans. So just to go into the pricing, we have our free growth pro and elite plan for what you'd be doing and getting up and running like you'd definitely be between the growth and the free.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Okay. Makes sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The difference between the growth and the free is you get rule based automations. With the growth, you get a customer portal service level agreements custom fields, and some of these other additional analytics and integration capabilities.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Oh, it directly integrates with slack, man, you guys know, your icp because that's exactly what I was thinking in my head. I was like, I wish that this could just go directly to slack from my inbox. So anyway, kudos again.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Send notifications to slack. That's another way to alert the team when something's pressing. Oh, yeah, go ahead. No, no, you go ahead.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Yeah, I'm just so I'm looking at these real quick. And again, I did very little research. I actually like to be sold if it's a good solution. So, I was like coming into this with an open mind. How does this actually look like inside of the product? Is that configurable through like an API? Is it, I click a button and a chat bot appears from you guys? You know what I mean? How does that work?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  In terms of within like our product?

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Like does this integrate directly in our product's interface? Is it something that's external? Like how does it integrate with our product?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we don't have mobile sdks today… so, but you can add like our chat like for instance, this is our chat that we use here for our clients. So this is in our product technically, it can just deep link to this.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Okay, perfect. Sweet.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But no, I appreciate, you know, taking the time here though, Ken, I can follow up with some more information after this, if you want to schedule another call after this, you know, maybe with the owner, we can do that as well or the CEO, we can do that as well, but just kind of keep me posted on what makes sense for potential next steps.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Yeah. I mean, I don't really like looking for multiple things. And so the fact that you guys have a free plan will sort of take care of itself because I want to deploy this pretty quickly. So if that goes well, I think the next steps sort of make sense and will make themselves known.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, and I can send you a link to sign up.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  So, let me send this to you. Yeah, Marty's going to love this. This is even, I was like, I don't know a lot of people make it very hard to get value out of their products, but this actually sounds very straightforward.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. It's straightforward. It's easy, it's light, but it gets, it's effective at the same time. So, I just sent you that link so that's where you can sign up for hiver right there. But it was, you know, it was great to meet you, Ken, I'll follow up with some other helpful information after this and I hope you have a great weekend.

Ken Marshall (ken@meetsona.ai):
  Thanks a lot Cole. Yeah, I really appreciate you taking the time cheers man. All right, take care cheers.
