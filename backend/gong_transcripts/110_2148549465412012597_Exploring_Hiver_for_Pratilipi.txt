Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hello?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Hey, hi, Raghav. Hey.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  How are you doing?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  I am all right. I'm just recovering from a cold.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  tell me about it, man. I just got out of a cold and a flu last week.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Yeah, same. I was on sick leave for the last two days.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Looks like something's flying around in India huh?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  This is the worst weather.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I know, right? Tell me about it. It's you know, what? Everything is haywire. Everything is either too hot or too cold. I hear there's.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  snow, where are you based? If I can ask?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. I'm based out of Chennai down south.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Oh, no wonder. Chennai, yeah, Chennai, extreme temperatures. Bangalore has weird weather conditions. So, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Are you in bangalore?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Our head office is in bangalore.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That makes so much sense. I used to live in bangalore till like 20 22 23. And then I'm just like the traffic is just abysmal and the flat rates are going up. I'm just gonna come back home.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Yeah, yeah. I guess everybody has once lived in bangalore and then they eventually move back home, they're like not worth it. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, definitely. But hey, jayantika. Hopefully, bangalore's weather is kinder to you. I wouldn't hold my breath against it, but hopefully, you know, fingers crossed for, you see, I mean, for today's call considering you're just recovering and everything.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I don't want to keep you for too long. Yeah, I noticed that we've now got the sales team as well that we last spoke about.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Yes. So it's not so much everybody but it was just the admin first who I wanted to add. And today, I've added like three more users from printing team. So we would require like three more shared mailboxes, that is, and we have currently operations and design and PPS. So like post publication support team was able to make like a shared mailbox. But, you know, the rest of them were not able to, because it said you're you know, you've limited speech. So, so, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So, jayantika to keep it straightforward, you basically need about four additional mailboxes over the three active ones that you have like, So I'm just trying.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  To look at technically three, three more mailboxes?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So realistically six mailboxes total, right? Yes, six more mailboxes. And I'm sure automations and everything as well will be required additionally down the line. Got it. So, jayantika as it stands.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Sorry to cut you off. But like currently, every, everything else that are that we're using that is basically the same for everyone, like no specific automations or no specific, you know, everything that we have right now with regards to custom fields or slas and things of that sort. That at all is going to be same for all of the departments or shared mailboxes. It's just the shared mailbox that we need so that every team is there and we can internally assign and, you know, set slas and things of that sort.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Now. That makes total sense. And in terms of the user count, how many people do you think will be on hiver with these three new mailboxes?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  We're going to have at least one, two, three, four, five, six, six more people from sales, then we would have three more people from sales… marketing and distribute, sorry marketing, PR marketing, and two more from so around like 11, 12 people more.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  11 to 12 people, right? Got it. So the reason why I asked this is right now the you're on the growth plan, yeah, the next year up is pro and that has a cap of five mailboxes total.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For anything more than five, we're realistically looking at the elite plan in terms of just the number of mailboxes in itself, right? Okay. And that also brings me to why I asked you about the total headcount because right now you're on monthly, I know it's just like a month and a half since you subscribed as well. Yeah. So what I can do is if, you know, you're open to sort of confirming pricing on all of this by the end of this month or a little before the end of the month, I can go talk to my leadership showcase that you've grown by almost more than 50 percent in terms of user since you started. Yeah, and that you're predicting another 10 to 12 people another, you know, 50 percent as well to grow in the team. I can get a discount on an annual contract for hiver and make sure the pricing is as close as possible to at least the pro. Because on growth, you're at like what 27, 30 dollars per person? Yeah, pro is at 45 list price and elite is at 75 list price. And these are annual prices, right? Monthly is definitely higher than this. So, yeah, I know where you're coming from. So what I can do is try to get a price closer to the 45 to 50 per user per month mark including discount and everything. But this will be looking at an annual contract. Will that be something you're open to doing just from a general budget perspective? I?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Would also definitely have to speak to, you know, the higher management to see, you know, yeah, because right now we were on a monthly plan because just wanted to, you know, just have everybody on board and explore and actually see how useful it is. I mean, the… what do you say like the testimony here is that we have so many people now on hiver because it has proven to be of use like assignment to slas. Everybody's pretty happy with how hiver is working and, you know, we're able to use more things. We have actually like our, you know, ease of work has come with hiver. So definitely, I feel like, you know, hiver is something that we all needed and I mean, it was a very better late than never sort of a thing for operations and everything else. And it's very nice. So I can also speak to my higher management and see if instead of a monthly plan, we would, you know, be like if the annual plan will make more sense to us considering there'll be a lot of users and, you know, per month like invoices and things are also very hard to maintain. So let me speak to them also like I can definitely like speak to them by this week itself and give you like, you know, heads up to if we are, you know, but the question is that even if we switch to pro for these many, so the users is unlimited or whatever that it shows there, right? That tags are unlimited and everything. So you can keep like a headcount of 15 more people joining the hiver team. I just wanted to know that in that case, you mentioned that the highest shared mailbox number would be five. Still would we have? Like, because like we have six departments there's, sales there's, operations, design, printing, and PPS, yes, marketing also. So six departments would need a shared mailbox. Three of us already have. So the three more we require. So would that also be a part of it? Like would we get an additional mailbox also? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So on that front, the kind of discount that I'm going to be discussing with my leadership team is going to be on the elite plan directly. Okay? So I'm not even going to discuss the pro plan only because, you know, if you start, if I give you that we negotiate, we do the whole thing and then if one month later you're just like, hey, it.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Doesn't make.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  sense, excuse me. So that's primarily where I'm coming from and just looking at headcount right now, you're at 19 people and you're like approximately 12 more people. So would 30 be a good number?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  15 also because there would be editorial team also, but that's only two people instead of giving them a shared mailbox, because they don't really require if it's two people, there's no need for a shared mailbox. Technically, they can just be a part of operations and, you know, just assign things to each other kind of that. So in operations, I can just add two more people for that. I don't need a shared mailbox, but otherwise I would need three more things. And considering how, you know, your elite plan may also have like more, you know, things that like dashboards and things of that sort. Then maybe the PPS team can, you know, customize to their benefit and similarly other teams, can, you know, use other things that the elite plan may also have. So that is like, you know, added benefit of shifting to that plan.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant, right? So basically the elite plan will give you unlimited access to all features.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay? Even the pro has a limit on the number of automations that it can create number of mailboxes. Obviously, there's a couple of other things that are limited as well on pro elite is basically you're unlocking everything hiver has without any limits on anything. So it's basically full fledged hiver package as a whole. And because you're effectively looking in the 30 35 user kind of ball range if pricing makes sense, is what I'm hearing. Yeah. So that's what I'm going to be going to my team with, I definitely need to talk to leadership to understand the level of discounts that are possible. What that looks like? Yeah. So that way, what I'll do is let me have that discussion. Let me send over a proposal to you. Sure, right? And then hopefully that gives you more details that your leadership team. I'm sure will ask you. Yeah. So let me get the first bit done for you. And one more thing I want to highlight is jayantika, if you know, if it's easy, we do offer half yearly payments as well on.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  An annual contract. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So if it does come down to cash flow at the end of the day, just let me know. I'm sure we can work something out.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Sure. That is a discussion we can probably have once you have a proposal, exactly. Yeah. Exactly. All right. Yeah. Sure. All right, then.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. Jayantika. Let me get something over to you by tomorrow before you start your day in Indian time. And that way we can continue the discussion, see what that looks like and effectively go at it from there.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Definitely works.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. All right. So, anything else for now?

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Nothing, there was this one query that my PPS team had, but I did tell her to reach out to the support from her system because it would be able to share screen and tell. So, for her, there was a default SLA, which was set for resolution and response time and, you know, the due soon is not reflecting for their mails. It's only overdue which is, you know, getting tagged, the mails are getting tagged. So, due soon is not visible to them. And with PPS considering it's like support, they need to be on their toes with respect to the time that they have given to the author that, okay, this website would be up by, so, and so time. So, therefore, they keep, they especially need reminders for what has to go up, when and things of that sort. So, for that, she had a query, but I think she can definitely reach out to support and, you know, get that sorted through like probably share. She would probably have to share her screen or it's some, things she wouldn't have checked or something of that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  That we can probably solve it's. Not a big issue. Otherwise, right now, everything is, I mean, technically on track, people are enjoying. I keep giving, as, and when people are added, I have to give like, you know, courses to other people, but they all get a hang of it pretty soon because it's not that complicated. That's the best thing. And a lot of people have also been enjoying the, you know, phone app version of it. So it makes things easier. So, love it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And hey, jayantika. I do want to tell you that if you ever add new team members on hiver and you want to give them training or like guidance or whatever, just let me know. And I, you know, we can schedule something like one.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Or two. Yeah, sure. Yeah, the way we had when we got onboarded, right? So, yeah, sure. Sure. If there's anything that is required, I would definitely reach out.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Love that show. Sorted. All right. Okay. Then, thank you so much for your time, jayantika. I'll get the, I'll get an offer over to you so you can start discussions on your side.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, hopefully we can wrap it up by the end of the month.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  Yeah, sure. Sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Take care, jayantika. Bye.

Jayantika Bajpai (jayantika@pratilipi.com):
  You too. Take care. Bye. Yeah, you too. Bye.
