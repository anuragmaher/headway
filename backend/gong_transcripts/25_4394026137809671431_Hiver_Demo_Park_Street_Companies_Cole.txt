================================================================================

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Flavia.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Hi, Cole. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you doing? Well. Nice. I appreciate you hopping on the call here today.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  No, thank you guys for taking the time so quickly.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, of course. So, just to set a quick agenda here, Flavia and I'm saying that right as well, Flavia. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah, that's right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, just to set a quick agenda, would love to start with a quick round of introductions, I saw some of the contacts you just sent over. So I appreciate that, but maybe just kind of further understanding that a little deeper would be helpful that we can jump into a product demo and save some time at the end for any questions?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah, yeah, for sure. Do you want me to just jump right in? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That'd be perfect. Okay?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Well, I reached out to you guys first and foremost, a colleague essentially let me know about hiver and so there was a conversation that was kind of floating around at the executive level about essentially in 20 26. How are, how do we communicate? I mean, we know how to communicate our workflows in terms of communication. We're looking to streamline processes, standardize a lot of our workflows when it comes to external communication. And we understand that, you know, we may need more of a ticketing structure, you know, with some more of like a ticketing platform feature rather than just kind of individuals messaging externally with our account base or we do have shared inboxes, but they're managed very sort of just email Esque, right? So we're essentially the project came to me because the executive team wanted me to start to just do a little bit of a discovery phase in terms of platforms out there? What features do different ticketing platforms have? And sort of, could we essentially move into a structure that was a little bit more ticketing Esque rather than just emailing back and forth, right? We would need big ones, you know, status, custom fields… shared analytics, things like that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  So that's kind of where this whole discovery phase kind of came in. And so a colleague mentioned that you guys do have a lot of those features that we're looking to see? And that's essentially what I reached out to you guys. Okay? And,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  is it primarily around the shared inboxes that you're looking to have this for? Or where do you see that fitting in?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah, we definitely want, I mean this is very preliminary so I can only, I can give you my imagination where I imagine we would like to go in some future. We definitely want a, I think a system in which we could integrate. I don't know like a customer portal, right? People could fill out a form. It lands in the appropriate inbox depending on, you know, different fields that they plug in and then essentially be routed to the correct team and just have different an Omni channel approach. We would have our inbox is a form, a chat, right? Or a portal, all of that kind of integrated and funneling through to an organized ticketing structure that's where I think the vision is going to go. But again, right now, we're just looking at different platforms that may have ticketing features. And, you know, how robust is the AI, things like that? Okay? Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Cause I know I last was meeting with Mario and Cyrus. Are those the people that introduced hiver to you?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So I know I was speaking with them in August about a potential front replacement or is that, would we be replacing front as well? Cause I know they do offer a lot of those capabilities. So kind of where does that stand today?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Sure. Well, there's two aspects of it, right? I'm not sure the aspect that Mario and Cyrus were reaching out to you guys about, they're definitely, I think leaning more towards an internal organization. So how things funnel within park street, they deal a lot with internal communication. I deal a lot more with external communication. So I think we probably may run into sort of, a hybrid. Some teams may stay in front, some teams may move into hiver. We have a lot of different aspects. So like I said, they work internally and we have maybe five or six groups which they work a lot internally. And then we have the majority of our base here is external facing, right? So dealing with our suppliers, our accounts… I could see some folks maybe staying in front. I could see some folks coming over to hiver. But what I'm looking for in my perspective is definitely from the external communication perspective. So I am looking to see what workflows we could do within hiver, that would facilitate external communication. So we're talking, our entire account base vendors that we work with on a daily basis… you know, compliance agencies. So again, it's all external.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So I can hop into a product demonstration here. If that'd be helpful just to kind of give, you know, the grand tour of hiver and some of our capabilities. Does that make sense for today? Yeah?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah, that'd be great. Okay. Cool. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Taking a look at my screen here, Flavia, what's nice about hiver is, you know, we are a certified Google partner, right? We live within that Google workspace. So you'll just log in with your normal credentials and you'll have your personal inbox up top, and then the shared inboxes below that will help manage as an organization. So clicking into the finance shared mailbox, you know, this can help us manage those external communications by managing some sub views beneath it, right? So the first on assign section, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be distributed either via automation or manual assignment. The next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me that I'm working on and I need to complete. And then there's the team view. So what is everyone currently working on within this, you know, mailbox itself, what's outstanding and what needs to be completed from an email perspective? Want to pause here? Any questions so far?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah. This view right here. So I can see you're there, right? So this is a view that essentially everybody has. You can click on anybody's name and you can see kind of their workload. Is that correct?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So I can, you know, Alex's name and see, hey, what's he owning in real time? What's he working on?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Got it. Would you be able to restrict that view or is this kind of native and everybody would have this?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So it's native. If you're a part of this mailbox, you'll be able to see it. If you remove people from it, they won't be able to see it.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Got it. Okay. So if you have access to the inbox?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, exactly. Okay. But going to the unassigned, right? I'll click in this email, you have things like sentiment analysis to track, you know, how clients are feeling via AI with the tone of the message, the email, whatever it might be?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  And we.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  have the ability to assign those conversations. So in this case, I'll assign to myself letting the team know I'll own this communication. The next side of work is like a round Robin automation. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So identifying request types and making sure it goes to the right person who handles that specific question.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Makes sense. We.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  also have something called personal inbox to share mailbox automation. Flavia. I'm not sure if that's something that would be interesting for park street, but essentially with… hiver, we're able to understand emails that are being sent to personal inboxes and then route them to the shared mailbox for visibility analytics and tracking purposes. So maybe if you have certain people or certain clients reaching out to people individually, and we can ensure that they're always being sent to a shared mailbox for that visibility and collaborative aspect.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Okay. That would be incredibly helpful. We do have that instance, right? We do have a lot of folks who, you know, for some reason may have a contact, a personal individual email as a contact from. I don't know, maybe eight years ago, right? They've been a partner with us for over 10 years or something which back then we didn't have shared inbox spaces. We definitely had just individual emails. And so that communication kind of even though you tell them time and time again, please email, you know, operations at parkstreet. Com. We're not seeing that behavior. So what's… the fix around that or how does that work here at hiver? So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We can do it a couple different ways. The first way we can do by identifying individual email types. So we can be like, hey, whenever this email reaches out to me, directly to my personal inbox, let's route to the shared mailbox for visibility and tracking. So we can either do by individual email identifiers or we can do it by domain, you know, anytime walmart reaches out to kohl's individually, let's route, you know, that communication to the mailbox.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Got it. Okay. So it's essentially like an automation that you program.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Okay. Gotcha.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Because a lot of customers like you like have that issue where they just keep reaching out to the individual, no matter how many times you tell them things get lost in the sauce, you lose the context that's where we kind of mitigate that. Got it. Then we can track the status of the tickets, right? Whether they're open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks. We're working through these to a resolution… adding tags for organizational purposes. So helpful for putting conversations in buckets folders or views. We can also report on these tags on the back end to understand, you know, why are people reaching out? What are the hot topics we're seeing amongst the team?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah. Kohl, I have a couple of questions here. Yeah, go ahead in terms of status. Is that adjustable, could we create different statuses or is open pending closed the default?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, open pending, closed is the default where you can create custom statuses though is in the custom fields, right? So I created a payment method, drop down field or if you want granularity around where it is in progress, you can do that.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Gotcha. Okay. So you can do custom field, but you can't do custom status, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. That's correct. So where people want more of the, hey, where are we in this conversation? They'll leverage the custom fields and they treat the status as just like, hey, have we worked through this? Let's close it out. Got it. And then we have that ability to collaborate internally, right? So collaborating back and forth, I'll send this notification to matt. He'll receive that notification in the bell icon. He can click on it. It'll take him right to this thread. We can kind of keep having that back and forth. But maybe we need more information. We can also leverage our co pilot to draft replies, and our co pilot can pull from our knowledge base notion internal resources, whatever it might be to help your team find information, craft responses more efficiently and effectively.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Gotcha. Is this is the AI and hiver, is this a gemini based AI or is this a different aspect here that you guys have an open AI? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So this is based off of open AI. Got it. Okay. Makes sense. But I want to pause here. What are your thoughts on this so far? Flavia?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  I think this makes sense. We've seen we see this in front obviously in a different aspect. So I am pretty aware that the custom fields, is not new front also has custom fields. It's just divided up a little differently here in terms of the custom fields. How custom can you get? And what I mean by that is in front, you can create custom fields based as like a, the entire instance like the entire account would have the same custom fields. Is that something that you guys, we can program via inbox? Like client vendor name is displayed under the finance inbox only.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's exactly correct. So, every custom field will be predicated based on the inbox you're involved in and you can have different custom fields based on the inbox you're associated with and what that inbox is trying to accomplish?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Makes sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then in terms of analytics, so we do have some workload and performance analytics as well. So just identifying, you know, how people are performing and where the volume is coming from. So let's take a look at like the last 90 days of data. We'll take a look at the, you know, support shared mailbox… here. We can see active new resolve conversations over the time period, what our average first response time was as a group, our average resolution time… individual metrics. So emails assigned per user, emails sent out per user, and then individual performance metrics below from an average first response or average resolution time.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Gotcha. Okay. Is.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  there anything that you would be specifically looking for?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah, custom field analytics is one that we would be looking to add. Is that something that you guys have? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we can create custom reports on that, right? So if you want to see like all resolve conversations that are associated with, you know, this assignee, Alex, that have these different custom fields, we can drill down into these below.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Got it. Okay. And those are kind of the custom fields that you guys have. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  These are all the different custom fields that we have that we can drill down further into.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Gotcha. What about, are we able to export this into some sort of CSV file?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. So we can export this. We can schedule them on a daily weekly, monthly basis wherever it might be via CSV or Aws S3 bucket.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Gotcha. Okay. Makes sense. And then I guess for the next part, maybe you're going to get into it, but AI is a big piece of twentytwentysix. I imagine many people's piece. I've seen some of the AI. Obviously, you showcase some of it here, just wanting to know obviously the sentiment for sure. And then what other pieces do you guys have? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we have the AI tagging. So being able to automatically categorize in conversation with the right tags, they flow in helping, you know, triage and route them to the right people. Also providing those tagging analytics to understanding request types over a time period. And what the team is facing, we have AI quality assurance that can automatically check for gaps and responses, suggest fixes, highlight support trends and quality, the sentiment analysis we discussed. Yep. And then we have the AI copilot, AI summarizer, which I also showed. So these are the main ones right here that we have released. But then on the docket for the rest of the year, we're going to have an AI agent that can end to end, resolve conversations over email.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Gotcha. That AI agent… is that only like internally, like it would be for internal users and they could ask the AI based like a like, you know, hiver employees. Are we talking externally as well? The, we get emails and then we, this AI chat would reply externally to our clients.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Externally. We teach the AI agent to respond to queries to help resolve them without human interaction.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Got it. Okay. Makes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Sense. Yeah. So that'll be the next iteration. And then you also mentioned a customer portal. We do have that as well. We kind of track tickets, log in track from an organization, organizational perspective or an individual perspective. And then you can submit the ticket here. We can also have a customized dropdown fields and information that can help streamline and capture the data that you want to intake.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Gotcha. Would this be connected to our knowledge bases? Cole, could we do that? Is this like a help center, customer portal style? So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  This is more of a dedicated logging customer portal. We do also have a knowledge base as well. Okay. That can be internal or external, but you can link the customer portal to the knowledge base for easy access and also submit issues from the knowledge base as well.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that would probably be more of the aspect that we're looking for kind of a help center style with ability to submit something to us. Yeah, obviously, when they can't find an answer, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent. So we can offer that as well.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Okay. I did see online, Cole, you guys had the restrictions to the amount of knowledge bases. I think depending on plan, I was wondering which plans offer, you know, the multiple knowledge bases, I.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Think, as of right now, we're only able to have one knowledge base. Okay, each account can either, yeah. So we can have one knowledge base at the moment and it can either be either external or internal.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Gotcha. Okay. And that's for the entire account, right? That's not per like a, yeah, exactly.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Are there a couple of cases where you'd want like additional knowledge bases based on department or something?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah. We have different knowledge bases. I mean, we have two specific like account bases. One is our supplier account base which they're essentially in the we're in the alcohol industry. And so they are the manufacturers of product, right? So we're talking distilleries and importers, and they're the ones who take care of the product. And then we do have another side of the business which is essentially the retail aspect which those are the folks in which we communicate with that actually sell it to then to consumers, right? So it would go from a supplier to the retailer. And those are different aspects of the industry, and therefore different knowledge bases, right? For us right now, we're functioning with both knowledge bases externally… but I understand that you guys offer the one. So I'll keep that in mind. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then in terms of the shared inboxes, right? So this is where we'll create the different shared inboxes manage them. And this is where we can create that personal inbox to share mailbox automation. Okay? For instance, this is one where it's like actually I'll start from scratch here. We can do this in bulk as well. But I'll just do like a single example. So, you know, new conversation comes into the member's personal inbox, we've selected everyone on the team and if it falls, you know, within this criteria set. So if it's from an email, you know, let's just say the email is like Cole at grexit. Com… and it's going to add it to the… shared mailbox for visibility. Got it. Makes.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  sense. Or?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We can just do it by general domain as well, but we can bulk, upload this. So it's not, you know, you don't have to do it like ticky tacky one off, like we can do this with a massive list.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Okay. In terms of the automations, Cole, we can create obviously inbox level automations. Yes. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So this is one right here, right? New conversation came inbound actually. Let me find a better one here. New conversation, an AI sentiment was updated in the inbox, right? And we've identified that the AI sentiment is negative or very negative. We're going to send a proactive email, you know, with like this information wherever it might be, customize, it, assign it to a user for escalation and add the L, three escalation tag, got.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  It. Okay. That makes sense. Could you also pull analytics from tag school or just the custom fields?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep, tags as well. So going back to the analytics is where we can see those tags. Let me click on the.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you request based on tag type over the time period? Okay?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Okay. Got it. Okay. Makes sense. Pretty… simple. Yeah, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Pretty straightforward. I know we are coming up on time here though, but in terms of your evaluation process, like, so what does it look like from here for you? And like will there be other people getting involved in this process as well?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Gotcha. Yeah. So in terms of the evaluation period, I'm thinking we'll probably take most of, I mean, I can't believe it's already the end of January, we'll probably take the most of Q1 in terms of evaluation and just seeing what is out there, what are the different abilities that we can do. Then after that, what would happen is I would probably take, you know, initial research findings over to our executive team just kind of showcase to them, what I found out, what's possible, what's not possible? And then from there, we're probably, I think at that point, maybe more of the, we would have at least another person kind of get involved in the process if we were to move forward and then the decision making after that, which obviously would lead to then implementation. So it's just me, I would say for a while until I can get in front of the executive board back and kind of showcase them my findings. It's just, it's going to take a while. I just started recently here and it's kind of already been two weeks. It just flies by when you're just doing initial research. So it'll probably take a little bit of time, okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then I also extended the trial until the end of March just because I know you said that was like your timeline. I want to give you plenty of time to evaluate us as you're kind of working through it. Okay?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Perfect. Thank you. And.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then what was I gonna say… for next steps? Like what would make sense for us in terms of like touching base to see how your testing is going and answer any questions that you might have?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah. Sure. I was thinking I would probably take about two weeks to, just because I also manage our customer service team. So this is kind of like a side project for me at the moment. Yeah. And so I'm thinking I think within two weeks, I should have enough bandwidth to kind of get in there and play around. I have to think about however not just from my customer service team which is kind of where this whole thing or originated from, right? Where the first line of defense. And so we really need more of a ticketing structure but the, this one, this needs to be expansive across all of park street and all of our external facing teams which I told they're quite a it's a huge feat here. So I have to think about hiver and kind of how it fits for them from their perspective. So I'm putting my, you know, my multi department cap on and I gotta, I'm gonna test for customer service then I'm gonna test for our operations team then for our compliance team, then for our accounting team, which they do a ton of communication externally, right? So I have, you know, some pretty big departments. I gotta think about it, how they do all of their work and make sure that it fits or at least find an answer for them that, you know, it's not identical to how you guys were doing it, but this is how hybrid does it and, you know, it brings if not, you know, equal amount of value, you know, extra value in this way.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So,

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  that's why probably at least two weeks so I can get all of the testing and then we could probably, I know connect maybe the second week of February. What do you think about that? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And if it works too, I could do the, just to give you that additional week as well in case you get bogged down at the same time. Okay?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Actually, do you think we could do Friday the, how's that? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's I can do same time on the as well. Okay?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Yeah, I can do the same time, on that Friday. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Cool. So I'll just send that over but just based off of your feedback so far, like do you see this being a potential fit like any red flags so far?

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  I think for sure potential fit. I mean, the only restriction obviously is that one knowledge base right now, but that, that's not that big of a deal. We can definitely work around. We could do different, you know, settings or different sections depending on. So there's definitely workarounds for that cold that's the only thing that popped up for me. Everything else looks pretty normal, pretty. I think it fits with what I'm kind of looking for right now. Okay? I'll let you know I'm going to work through some of the testing and I can well, you let me know. Should I email you if I want to do something, you know, particular, and I can't find a workaround or who would be the best contact? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Honestly, we have a technical support team who's available 24 seven, three six five. So you can, I'll show you how to reach them too over a live chat, so you can click on this hybrid button top, right? Okay. Go to instant chat support 24 seven and engage our team over the chat.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Perfect. Okay. And.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  they'll answer any question, hop on a call, whatever works best.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Perfect. Yeah. There's just sometimes there's tiny nuances that, you know, you can't get around and you're like I just need the key, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, totally. Get that. All right. Perfect. I appreciate the time. I'll follow up with more information after this as well like setup guides, training videos in case you want to review them. I'll look forward to touching base with you in a couple weeks and I hope you have a great weekend same.

Flavia Segatto (fsegatto@parkstreet.com):
  Thanks, Cole. Have a great weekend. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Take care. Bye bye.
