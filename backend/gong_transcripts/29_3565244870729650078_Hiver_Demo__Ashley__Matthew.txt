================================================================================

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  hey, Matthew. Nice to meet you. Hey.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Ashley. Nice to meet you. How are you doing?

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  Doing pretty well. How was your New Year's.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  it was good yourself.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  It was pretty quiet which was nice.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I was going to say mine was pretty uneventful but yeah, not bad.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  All right. Hey, Derek. Hey, Patrick, I think we're maybe just waiting on Andrew from our side, and,

Patrick O'Gorman:
  Ashley, he might be on a call so we can probably get started without him and have him join whenever. Okay?

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  Great. Sounds good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Well, I can set the agenda here. So my name is matt senior account executive here at hiver agenda. For the call. Ashley did share some information about, you know, the purpose of this call, but just wanted to spend the first two minutes or so.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Just getting an understanding of exactly, you… know, the search and the reason for having this meeting today. And then from there, I can tell you a little bit about hiver and walk through the product and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good? Sounds great? Awesome. So from my understanding, this is for the operations team.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  It is yep. So a segment of Patrick's team for operations is our customer success group, and they're currently working out of two different shared Gmail accounts, and they're very lean but very efficient team. So we're looking at different AI opportunities to be able to empower them and come up with things like suggested responses, maybe pre drafted responses just to make their lives a little easier.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. That's exactly what hiver does. And then how many people are on this team that would need access to this?

Patrick O'Gorman:
  So, it would probably be three to start with. And then we may look at kind of as we see how effective it is, look at rolling it out for one of our other shared inboxes, which would be a couple of additional users. So I think three for one inbox to start with?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. And you said there's two inboxes you want to use hiver for, right? Yeah.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  Potentially, I think we're going to start with just the first one with the three people.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Okay. Makes sense. Perfect. Well, yeah, definitely sounds that hiver could be a good fit here. As you mentioned you're using Gmail, right?

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  Yes.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Well, we're a certified Google partner and just a little background about hiver. We've been around since 2017. We are a help desk platform. We have over 200 employees. We have over 10,000 paid customers in over 50 countries with teams using our platform ranging from small businesses all the way up to some of the largest enterprises in the world, companies such as capital one and open AI, just to name a few. So hiver, you know, the reason people choose hiver is that it's just, it's really fairly straightforward, easy to use, but at the same time, it can be quite powerful and, you know, as I said, we support some very large enterprises with, you know, managing, you know, over 100 mailboxes in hiver with over a 1,000 users. So it is very scalable and easy to use. So, a big difference between hiver and these other platforms out there is that we're a certified Google partner. So you just simply download the extension. Once you download the extension, you're going to see these yellow icons in the top right here and then down here on the bottom left. So it's conveniently in your Gmail inbox. So you're going to be able to answer, your personal emails just like normal, they're not connected to hiver. They're not shared with anybody. And then now you're just going to have easy access to those shared email addresses. And then the notifications come through right here. So down here on the left, you're going to see, these folders are tied to a shared email address, right? So if you want to have one folder tied to one, you know, support is going to be tied to, you know, support at husk, com operations, however you want to set it up, this is just an example. But basically each folder is tied to a shared address.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Then how it works is whenever somebody emails that shared address, it's going to land in the shared folder… right? So, and then whoever has access to this folder is going to see it. So everybody can see all the emails coming in. You're no longer going to have to log into that shared address. That's another key part with using hiver is you don't have to log into that address anymore. It's just going to be connected to hiver. Okay. And when it comes in, you're going to have this panel on the right hand side. So essentially, what hiver does is hiver takes these emails here and just kind of conveniently turns it into like a help desk for you to use. And it starts in the unassigned folder. And from the unassigned folder, a couple of things can happen. So the unassigned folder is basically just letting you know, like, hey, these are new emails that I've not assigned to somebody. And that's one of the first things you need to do in hiver. So the first things you need to do is assign it to somebody on your team to be responsible for that email. So if I assign this to matt here, matt will get notified up here in the notifications. And you'll notice that there's only seven emails unassigned emails now, and I have one in my mind folder. So everyone's going to have their own mind folder where they can see all the emails that are on their plate. And.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  Are there, is that configurable by like round Robin or specific workflows? So if we have specific clients or specific like email addresses, yeah, reach out, we can assign them to certain people.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. We have a ton of automations, very a lot of different automations. Actually, another big reason people come to us is just the amount of automations that we have available. But yes, we can set up by domains. We can do automations based off keywords. So you have a lot of options there. Great. Yeah, like for instance, if Derek was responsible for all the Amazon com people that come in, we basically just create an automation that says anytime somebody emails this address and has the domain Amazon com, it should automatically get assigned to Derek. Great. And then yeah, we can also do round Robin as well. So that's also an option too. And then the other great thing too is if you have multiple folders set up like each folder can have separate workflows. And, you know, maybe one email is round Robin, but the other one you don't want round Robin, you want to do it a different way then that's totally fine as well. And then there's also tags. This, these are customizable. This allows you to categorize these tags. These can also be applied via automations as well. And can also be applied via AI too. So essentially on the backend, you just tell hiver where, like what kind of emails to get, what kind of tags? And then the AI learns and we'll start doing it… and I'll get to the part where, you know, we automate the responses too. But this is kind of core features of hiver too. So I'm just walking through it real quick. And then there's also statuses right? Open pending, closed. This lets you know, if something's been taken care of or closed out… there's also custom fields here. Anything custom that you're looking to track, you can add, you know, dropdowns text fields, et cetera. And then there's a note section down here. This is where you can put notes. You simply put the at mention button here. Everyone's name in the account pops up. It could be like, hey, Cole, can you help? And then Cole here would get notified that we've asked them to help on this email. So you can have those internal conversations back and forwards. Awesome. And then to reply to the emails, you got a lot of options. So first of all, it's not AI, but we do have email templates that you can set up and share with everybody on the team. So just for those kind of repeatable emails that you get a lot of, you can have those that are conveniently available. We also have an AI compose right here. It's kind of like an AI chat. Gpt built in where you can easily, you know, fix the grammar, make it more empathetic, make it shorter et cetera. Just conveniently there. And then we have an AI copilot which can actually draft replies for you. It's going to ask a three, four to four prompt clarifying question for accuracy purposes. You select the prompt that you want, and it will go ahead and draft a reply for you. Now, where the AI is learning for these emails is different sources. So it learns from the emails that you're getting, it can also reference hiver's knowledge base. So you can build a knowledge base in hiver. You can also upload documents into the backend of hiver. So any operating procedures, you know, any kind of documents that you want to reference. And it can also reference snippets as well and notion articles if you're using notion.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And… you can make adjustments with it. You can make it shorter et cetera. And then it will just go ahead and get applied right here.

Derek Paterson:
  So that will I'm sorry, go ahead Derek, how well does it handle adjustments based on what sort of tone we want to shift to?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Sorry, you cut out there. The first part, what'd you say, how?

Derek Paterson:
  Well, does it handle adjustments based on like changing the tone?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You can adjust the tone. Yeah, it's well… we're using gpt five which is the most powerful processor… for it. So, yeah, you can adjust tone works well.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  So, I think one of the use cases and I'm not sure if this fits in your stack, but I think it's an example that it's worth talking through is, and Patrick correct me if I'm wrong. But one of the use cases is we get a lot of emails from users where it's the same questions over and over that are very easily found in our faqs. Is that something that we could train the agent to do is just automatically reply with responses versus us having to have our customer service members actually go in and draft them themselves?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's on the roadmap. It's not available right now for email. There is something available for that for chat but not right now for email. Got it.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  Okay. But to clarify there, it can still, we can still train it on the faq documents and have it essentially draft. The email just needs to be reviewed by a human before it's sent.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Okay. And I,

Patrick O'Gorman:
  think honestly, Ashley, at least at the start, I'd be a little more comfortable with that until we kind of, I'm sure we're going to have to refine the training a few times before we get it to a point where we'd even be comfortable with it sending on its own. So that's not really a huge concern for me right now but would be great to have in the future for sure.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  Makes sense. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's definitely on the roadmap, you know, as we all know AI is huge now too. So it's our highest priority and we've been shipping new AI features very frequently, especially over the past six months. And that's a big one as well. So there's that the responding to it, can I ask?

Patrick O'Gorman:
  One other question Matthew? Yeah. So all of the emails are being sent from your personal inbox here, right? Are you still able to set an alias, like instead of it saying, you know, it came from Ashley at husk, have it go through as support at husk?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, basically, you just make the settings in Gmail, but yeah, as you can see here, I can actually reply from my personal email or the support email.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  Okay. Cool. And then.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There's also this team view and this allows you to see all the open emails that are assigned across the team just to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks… right? So, I have 23 open emails here. It also lets you know which emails are late. So we can set slas for these emails. They can be applied to all the emails. Or maybe you just want to apply slas to certain emails. And it's like, hey, if nobody replies to this email within three hours, we want, you know, we want the supervisors to be notified that it's late. So we can have notifications go out to people. And then also you're going to see this red lightning bolt here, letting you know, okay, these emails are late. And then you're also going to see this sentiment analysis. This is just the AI sentiment analysis just letting you know the sentiment of the email. So, you know, if it's if they emailed in and they're unhappy, it'll let you know that. And we can also create workflows with that too. So basically… if anybody unhappy comes in, you know, we can have it get automatically assigned to somebody on your team. Okay? And the great thing with this, right? Is you can click on anyone's name. So let's just say Yukta's out today. I click on her name. I can see all 15 emails that have been assigned to her that she's working on. So I can click on any of her emails. I can see all the back and forwards she had with this chain, right? I can see all the history when it came in changes that were made et cetera. I could answer it for her from, you know, the support email from my personal email. I could close this out for her. Or what I could do is I can even take all of her emails and just assign them to somebody else.

Derek Paterson:
  Does the extension integrate with the Google calendar? So for example, if someone is on the support team and they have an out of office flag set, can that avoid like being in the round Robin queue, or would that have to be manually set up?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That would, so it doesn't sync with the calendar. There is an availability within hiver for the round Robin that you can set. But yeah, unfortunately, it doesn't sync with the Google calendar.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, there's that the sentiment analysis… and then I would just say lastly, is the analytics, right? So you can select the mailbox or the mailboxes, you want to see, you select the timeframe could be custom, could be the last 90 days and you're going to see things like the workloads, you're going to see things like how many new emails did you get in that timeframe? How many emails were resolved or closed out? Now, you can filter this information for person category, custom fields, anything custom that you're looking to see? You're also going to see the workload across the team. So how many emails you've assigned to each team member in that timeframe, how many emails they've sent out… and the performance of each team member. So how long is it taking, you know, Cole here to respond to emails? How long is it taking him to resolve these emails? We can also include things like customer satisfaction surveys to go out at the bottom of the emails. And then those tags are super helpful because you can look back and say, hey, last month, you know, our support email, we got 111 emails asking us about billing questions, or, you know, 40 emails asking about AI, etc.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  I love that because that'll help us in product too with our focus areas of where things might need to be made a little more clear. Yeah, I.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  Love it that's an Ashley feature for sure.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  Yes.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  Great then.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There's also SLA reporting. So if you have those slas set up, it'll let you see like how well you're complying with them or how often you're violating those slas, right? And you can even analyze this further. You can see it by person. So last month, right? We see you have violated the first response 21 times. And these are the emails down here that you can reference, et cetera. Then there's the customer satisfaction surveys. If you wanted to include those, the sentiment analysis will let, you know, the sentiment of the emails that are coming in.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  So really helpful insights that I don't know that we have a lot of right now. So that's promising, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then you could do custom reports again. So if there's anything custom that you were looking to report on and you can save this based on, you know, response time, new emails, active emails, custom fields, et cetera. All this information is exportable to a CSV file. So you could set different filters for it. You can export all of this. You can set it to be automatically emailed to you. And then there's also custom dashboards as well. So.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  I have a question about, I guess permissions levels. Is it possible to set someone as like, you know, the admin who can set up those workflows and round robins and run the reports and everything, and then have other people just be kind of standard help desk users? Yep?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. That's. Exactly how it works. Okay. Yep. So yeah, you choose the users and roles, you decide who's the admin, the admins have access to the backend for the workflows et cetera. Is.

Derek Paterson:
  that feature available on all of the plans? Or is that just elite? Because I see the custom roles in elite? Yeah, so.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Custom roles is something else. But, yeah, this is the roles admins member that's standard that's available in everyone. Okay. Cool. Yeah, custom roles is one honestly that doesn't come up too often but basically just like, yeah, it gives you the ability to create different custom permissions for different, certain users. Okay?

Patrick O'Gorman:
  Yeah. I mean, I think just the manager and agent is probably all we really need there. Yeah, the admin and agent, but I wouldn't want like agents being able to go in and, you know, set themselves to be skipped in the round Robin so they don't have emails coming to them or.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Something, of course, not, they won't have access to that. So, yeah, no problem there. Yeah. And then lastly, I'd say the other huge thing too is we also have 24 seven support, right? So 24 seven chat support goes to a real person here at hiver. They're also able to get on the call with you fairly quickly as needed to. So if you look at the online reviews for hiver, you're going to see a lot of positive reviews about support especially even for, you know, even for smaller teams like yourself, you're still going to have access to this 24 seven support, which is, you know, we bring over people from these larger platforms all the time and, you know, it takes them, sometimes it takes them days to hear back when they have an issue as opposed to hiver, you know, you'll get to speak to someone almost instantly. Awesome. So.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  I guess then question on my end would be just kind of what does pricing look like? Is it based on licenses, how many users we're offering or?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So there's an annual plan. And then there's a monthly plan, right? If you want to do month to month, you can save, you can save money. Obviously, if you pay for the year front to 20 percent, the different plans have the different features, right? You know, one of the main features that you're looking for is the AI to draft replies for you. That is the copilot feature. So you would need pro to have that. And pros are most popular package as well. But yeah, there's this package, it's 65 dollars per user per month. The only caveat here is it is sold in buckets. So the first bucket is two users. The second bucket is five users. And then it's sold in increments of five. So 510 1,520.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  So it's 130 bucks a month for two users.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yep. That would be billed annually. So you'd pay for the year front at that rate, yep.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  Okay. I mean, I don't have any other questions right now, Derek Ashley, anything on your end?

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  I think the only one that I have is if we could go back to the integrations, I'd like to understand the Jira or atlassian integration if you guys have it because I saw it on your website and I'm just thinking that this is another time saving opportunity Pat for your team is if there is something that needs to be escalated to dev instead of Andrew having to go manually, create that ticket. If there's a way that we can create those from the email responses and notes, that would be awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So, I don't have Jira on my computer here, but I can show you that. Basically there you just pull up the app. So when you're next to an email. So right here's the help desk platform, you just click the apps button here. And one of the ones you can do is create a Jira issue directly from right here.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  Awesome. That could be useful. Thanks. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And speaking of integrations, we have some other ones too. Let me pull this up. Not sure if you guys use any of these other platforms as well.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  We use Hubspot, but mostly.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  For marketing, yeah, not so much for customer support that's more marketing and pipeline management. Okay. Got it. So, yeah, I think Jira would be helpful for sure there. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And so I'll just show you how the Hubspot one works basically is when somebody emails in, if that email is already in Hubspot, let's just say it would show if there was a deal associated with that email, company, info, contact info associated with that email, right? So it would just show the information associated with that email directly from Hubspot in hiver. Okay? And then we have a two way sync with Salesforce but not with Hubspot at this time, but coming soon, you'd be able to like again… I don't think this is huge for you, but like as right now we can create leads contacts opportunities straight from here. So the ability to do that within Hubspot as well as soon?

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  Cool. Yeah, we're not a Salesforce shop right now, but it's good to know that it's there. Yep. Awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But great. That's it. And then the last thing I'd say too is we also, you also can try it out. So we offer free seven day free trials. You'd get access to all the features. You get access to our 24 seven support during it as well. I'll email you everything, our pricing page, what we talked about today. And then I'll also email you over our help center too, where you can, you know, we have tons of different walkthroughs, anything that you're trying to get set up? When.

Derek Paterson:
  you email us pricing, can you check and see if there is an existing agreement with hiver from either constellation software or the valeris group? Those are our. So valeris group is our parent company, and then constellation is the parent company of valeris group. So it would be helpful to know that information.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I will, I just want to make sure I spell it right? How do you spell those? Just to make sure?

Derek Paterson:
  Yeah, I'll put it in the chat.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. And then,

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  one other thing I'm not sure if you're able to share this demo recording, but one of our colleagues, Andrew wasn't able to join and I'd like to get his opinion on this as well if you don't mind.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I'll share the recording. Thank you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Those names, these names seem familiar, but no problem.

Derek Paterson:
  Constellation is a pretty big company, so.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah… definitely. I'll double check on that and I'll email it to you. And as far as your timeline goes, when were you looking to like have a decision or want to get something like this set up? I think probably.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  In the next month or so is when we'd like to kind of roll it out with whichever solution we're going with. I mean, this is a really busy time of year for our support team. So it… exaggerates the need but also reduces the amount of time that the support team will have to kind of get it set up and do the trainings and stuff. So I think that's kind of the timeline we're looking at, but maybe plus or minus a couple of weeks. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Well, I'll email everything over to you guys. And then if you were interested in starting the trial, just let me know when you're interested in getting that started and we can put something on the calendar, you know, maybe like 20 30 minutes here, and just either help with the setup or answer any questions that you might have?

Patrick O'Gorman:
  All right. Sounds good. Sounds.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, appreciate it. And, yeah, and let me know if you guys need anything else.

Patrick O'Gorman:
  All right, we'll do. Thank you for your time, Matthew.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks so much. Thank you.

Ashley Morton (amorton@huskwellness.com):
  Bye.
