Call: Hiver Demo | Kate <> Matthew
Date: 2025-11-11T04:31:03+05:30
================================================================================

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  I will just see me.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Well, yeah, as, this meeting is being recorded so I can share, you can share it with you after. Is that all right?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Perfect. That'd be great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. Well, yeah, the agenda for the call today, one, let's just spend the first five minutes or so helping you determine if hiver can fit your needs. And then from there, I can walk through the product and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Yes, that sounds great. And sorry, my internet's a little spotty. So I turned off my camera.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No problem at all. No problem at all. You absolutely do not have to have your camera on.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  They want me to. So, but you absolutely do not have to. So yeah, if you can tell, you could start here, tell me a little bit about what kind of motivated you to look, what's motivating the search right now?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  So I work with a pretty small team and we wear a lot of hats. We basically do onboarding throughout the rest of the customer journey. And so we're kind of we're in this place that we're getting a lot of support requests that are taking us away from a project and we're having to jump to that kind of log into their account and it's taking a while. So we're looking for something that can help us automate a little bit without going fully off automated. We still want to write customer responses and stuff, but, we would like to find like an AI tool that can help us draft responses right in an inbox and make sharing tickets a little bit easier and be able to kind of tell what each other are doing. So we're not duplicating responses or missing anything… that's kind of where we're at.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yep, those are all things that hiver does, very well. And are you using Google suite?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Yeah. Right now, we're using Gmail.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Perfect. And so, so, yeah, hiver works predominantly with email. So do you have like a shared email address that these people email into like a support ad or?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Yeah. So we have our direct emails and then we have a support ad that we're all getting forwarded to. I guess. So we work out of both and clients reach out to us on both?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Great. That's that's also exactly how hiver works. So I'll show you that today and how many people manage this or would need access to this potentially on your team?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Probably four.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Awesome. Four to five.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So we do sell in buckets of five, but it sounds like you have close to five. So that's great. Perfect. And as far as your timeline goes here, is this something you were looking to get up and running fairly soon here? If it was a fit or?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Great. I want to ensure my screen. Can you see it? Yep. Awesome. Well, hiver is a certified we're a certified Google partner. So you simply download the hiver extension. And once you download the extension, you're going to see these yellow icons on the top right here. And then you're going to see these yellow icons on the left here.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And the benefit of that is you can answer your personal emails just like normal. And then you're going to have really easy access to the support emails right here in one screen without having to hop to a separate application. It's all conveniently in your Gmail account.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then once an email comes into that support email, it's going to land in this unassigned folder. And then you and your whole team can see this folder here. So an email comes in. And now, when you open these emails, you're going to have this panel, this hiver panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you're going to be able to assign the emails to each. Other. So if I assign this to matt here, matt would get notified up here on the right with the notification. And everyone's also going to have their own mind section where they get where they can easily see all the emails that have been assigned to them.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We can also set up automation so that they automatically get assigned to the right person too. We could do that based on keywords or domains. So like for instance, if you handle all the, you know, billing questions that people have, we can have it so that anytime an email comes in and mentions the keywords, invoice, taxes billing, then it will automatically get assigned to you. Okay? Statuses open pending closed. So you'll know the status of these emails. There's tags so that you can categorize these emails. There's custom fields, anything custom that you're looking to track there's. A note section where you can add notes. You hit the add mention button. Everyone's name in the account pops up and I can, you know, be like, hey, Cole, can you help on this, right? And then Cole would get notified… so you can go, yeah, so you can go back and forwards with your team on these emails and help each other as well?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. So if multiple people would need to get involved, you can kind of pass it back and forth, correct? Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. You can, you can exactly have the communication down here, that happens all the time with us, right? If any of my customers start emailing into support, usually, our support team cannot mention me and they might add mention my manager as well, right? And they're like, hey, can you guys help on this, right? So, so absolutely, you can get multiple people involved and go back and forwards.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. And then from here, you know, obviously, one of the main reasons you're here, we can do as well. So first of all, we have templates that you can set up and share with each other. So those are just like static templates that can be shared amongst you guys. We have a chat gpt feature as well where you can fix the grammar, make it shorter, make it more empathetic. And then we have an AI co pilot which can actually learn from the emails that you're getting it'll. Ask a three option clarifying question. You choose which one you want and it will actually draft a reply for you.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, this can also reference emails. It can also reference, documents… and URL websites as well.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. And then do you have to set it up with the documents ahead of time? Like load? I don't know knowledge based documents in there for it to pull from?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yep. That's how it works. Yep.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay, cool.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. But it's quite easy to do.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You have the different sources here. You can upload them et cetera. And do you have like a knowledge base already built?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Right now, it's on our website. We're kind of planning on redoing it. It's pretty old. So we were actually looking at, I think scribe to help us build some newer material for that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So yeah, you can put the URL there. Okay? Then hiver… the other thing we could do is also, you can also make a knowledge base in hiver as well.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, like here's ours, obviously, you can have your logo and things like that, but all the articles, search, et cetera.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'll pause here. Any questions so far? About that folder? Does that all make sense?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  I guess for the co pilot, do we have to train it or is it like pretty sentient and like, will it recognize natural language and draft responses on its own? Or is it all us training it on the backend? How to say it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it's a bit of both, right? Like, it can prompt responses without you doing anything. It can learn… from emails and do responses kind of without you training it. But of course, you know, the more a little bit of more of a training that we do initially, right? The better the responses are going to be.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. Got. It. Makes sense.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. So, yeah, it's basically built from openai as well. So that's kind of the LLM that we're using with it?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay, perfect. Okay.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  When you were in an email and the window opened up on the right, where you could like open and close it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Like the status at the top? Is that the tip? Like, can you close it when you're done with a task? Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. And.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Then if you like scroll down, are you able to see like the history of what has been going on within?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Everything's tracked when it was received, changes, notes, tags, anything? Okay. And also, you can run reports on all that information as well.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. Perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then in this team view here, this team view allows you to see all the open emails across that address and who's working on them, right? So in our support email, I have 20 open emails, right? Yukta has five. I have three et cetera. I can click on anyone's emails here. I can see all of Rakesh's response. If he's out, let's just say Rakesh is out today, right? I can come in here. I can see all the emails that Rakesh is responsible for, all the timing, the back and forwards. I can reply on them. I can reply to them for him. I can close them out for him, right? I could even if he's going to be out all week, I can even take all of his stuff here or some of his emails and just assign them to somebody else.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  And those are not the emails going directly to him, right? Those are the ones that have been assigned to him from the support.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. These are the ones from the support. But the other thing too is let's just say you get a personal email to you, right? Not to support… right? So I got let's just say, I got, I know this is a random one. But if I just got this email, okay? And what you can do is if you get a personal email, you have the ability to the top right here to add it to the inbox. So if this was an email that I thought, you know, I want everybody to have visibility in or we want to assign to somebody, right? Yeah, I can just simply hit this button here. And now it's going to be in the support folder. Everybody can see it.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. And you can still like assign it to yourself. But that way everyone.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. I can assign it to myself. I can assign it to somebody else et cetera. But yeah, this way, it's part of the support folder. Everyone can see it. Okay? So basically, yeah, so basically, that doesn't.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  like change the thread at all or notify the customer just not.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  At all. No customer is going to know that you're using anything like hiver, okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You can also set up slas, so it could be like if nobody responds to an email within X amount of hours, then we want to be notified that, that's late. So, I know here that these emails right here are late.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah. So basically, yeah, I wanted to show you that you can easily share these amongst your team. We have the ability to automate and draft responses through AI, and you can also see the visibility of what everybody else is doing as well with hiver.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. Awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then these little Smiley faces here are AI sentiment analysis. It's just letting you know the sentiment of these emails coming in. So if it's a negative email, positive email, et cetera.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Oh, that's cool.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then basically, yeah. So how we package the AI, it's all conveniently, you get access to all of our AI features. So you'll get access to those, the responses, the AI chat, gpt, the sentiment analysis. We also have AI tagging as well where it can actually automatically tag these emails. So you basically just describe on the backend which type of emails you want for these tags? And then the AI can start doing it automatically for you.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And where that really comes into play is the analytics. So we got reporting as well. So you click on your support email, you select the timeframe, could be custom, could be the last nine days and you're gonna see things such as how many new emails did you get in the past month or so?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  How many emails have you resolved? Is it up or higher than the previous month? You're gonna see the cumulative average first response time of everybody? How long has it taken you to resolve these emails? Again? Is it higher or less than before? You can see things like the workload across the team, you know, in the past month, we assigned 128 to Cole. We assigned 71 to matt, and also gonna track each person's response times and resolution times. We can also include customer satisfaction surveys. And then with those tags, you can look back and say, okay, in the past month, we got 90 emails about billing issues. We got, you know, 50 emails about an AI feature.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay? And then with those slas, you can also track the compliance and violation of them. So, you know, in the past month, how many times did we violate these slas? And is it higher or lower than before? How much time did we comply with these slas? Is it higher or lower than before customer satisfaction surveys? Is also a report? And then the AI sentiment analysis?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. And a cool thing we can do with these sentiment analysis too is like, you know, we can create automations. This is all throughout hiver really… and we have dashboards and custom reports. This is all exportable as well. But a big part of using hiver is with these automations.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, what the automations are? It's like if this happens, then we want this to happen, right?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, in the instance that a new conversation is received?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  If… I want to show you something else actually?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  If a new conversation is received, and in the body of the email, it mentions the word these following, if it mentions these words.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Then we want it to automatically get assigned to Nicole, and we want it to automatically add a… billing tag and it will summarize it. Yep. So basically, when the, so you can imagine there's a lot of different scenarios we can set up, but it'll summarize it. So when a first email is received in the support email, if it mentions the words billing related terms, then assign the conversation to Nicole and add a billing tag and you said save. And then now moving forward, that's what's going to happen.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. And I noticed that you integrated with slack, I believe.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we have, yeah, we have quite a few integrations. The one with slack. It's right now, it just sends you notifications in slack.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  So, are you able to set up a flow like that? Like if it mentions like the site being down, can it notify or set a notification to someone in slack? Letting them know like rit or development team or no?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  That's kind of an extra, but we were like, we're not sure if we need to add him into that inbox because we mostly communicate with them via slack.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So I think it can notify it could notify a channel in slack. And if he's part of that channel, I think he would see that or they would see that. I mean, double check on that one, but, I believe so, yes… because how it works, is it'll go to a channel?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Yeah.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Or Jira too. Either one of those would probably work.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, it'll notify a channel there. And then with the Jira one… I think it will work with slack. I think it will work with slack. So, yeah, I think we're good there. I'll double check though.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Because, yeah, you can also create, this one, do it automatically, but you can create, Jira issues from hiver as well.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Very cool.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, if you got an email like that, you can create a Jira issue so we can do either.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  I had one more question about the reporting. Is there a way to like separate the reports from like onboarding emails versus customer support emails? If they're they have a tag in them?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can. Okay.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Cause like sometimes it takes us much longer to complete a onboarding task than it does for support. And so, I didn't know if that would largely skew it or if you could separate them.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, exactly. So you can, first of all, you can build custom reports based on those tags.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, we can do, you can call it what you want and it can be based off those tags that you have. And then also with the prebuilt, reports here, you'll see in many of them, you can filter.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Oh, okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You can filter.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. And then from here, also, you can group them whether it's by. You can also group them by tag, but filter would work better in the scenario that you displayed, but I'm just showing, you can also like do these other, ideas here, but yeah, absolutely you can.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Awesome. Yeah, those are the only questions I had as of now.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Absolutely. Yeah.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Is the pricing all on your website? And if there's different options, which one would you recommend for?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can go over the pricing. Yep, the pricing's on our website, I'll email everything to you. So, you mentioned you have about five people, right? And you have one shared email address you want to use. Support?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Well, we'd have three to five people, cause we were kind of, we were debating about the development team and then, yeah. So the one shared is support.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. That's fine. So, basically, there's a couple of things here. So there's the growth, and the pro version. You don't need hipaa compliance, do you?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  No.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So there's then you're looking at growth and pro. The main difference. It's easiest if we just look at pro just to show the differences. Okay. Right. So, if you want customer satisfaction surveys, you're going to need pro. So, basically, everything in here is all the extra stuff that comes with pro. So, customer satisfaction surveys, you need pro, if you want to be able to set business hours for your mailbox. So basically, that way, if you, so, for the instance, if you have an SLA, and you get emailed at 11 30 at night and nobody responds in two hours, it's going to show it as late.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Then basically, if you have business hours set up, then it won't show it as late because it, but you got that email outside of business hours.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. So, if SLA reporting and stuff is very important to you, that's another reason that people will go pro, chat feature. This is a chat that goes on your website that can also be handled here within hiver.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Do you have any?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Our inbox here. And, okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, there's a separate section down here, sales chat… and it can get assigned to people, tags all that as well, very simpler. And it just comes from, the website, wherever you want to put it. Yep. So that's another reason people will do pro cause they want the chat, load balance around Robin is basically, if you want to set up around Robin, where the emails come in and just gets around Robin amongst your team, it can round Robin it and then also take into consideration the load of each person has. So, like if you already had five active emails on your plate and, you know, somebody else in your team only has one, then hiver will sign it to that person, the other person.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Custom dashboards is the ability to create dashboards, data exports. So, scheduling them, having them instantly emailed to you, customer satisfaction analytics, and then also the SLA analytics as well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, those are all things that, come with the pro. If you want any of those, then, you would need pro.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. The reporting that you showed me today was that, so, is that all the pro, the analytics?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, so the csat and the SLA ones are both pro. So, which those ones, are so not everything I showed you is pro in the analytics. So, this SLA reporting is pro, this shows you how many times people violated it. Okay, right. I can say, okay, last month, 85 people, we violated SLA, 85 times. These were the emails. And then these were the people who did it. Okay, right? So that is one, anything to do with the customer satisfaction surveys is another pro one. And then the ability to create custom dashboards is another pro feature.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay. Does it come with one already or are they all custom?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  The, the dashboards are custom. Okay. Yeah, but they're fairly easy to set up as a prompt and you just select the ones that you want.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But yeah, that, those are all things there. And then the only add on that we have is for the AI. So you, we include all the AI in the same package. It goes across the entire account and it's an additional 20 dollars per person.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, if you're looking at pro, you're looking at about 65 dollars per user per month billed annually. And if you're looking at growth, you're looking at, you know, about 45 dollars per user per month billed annually with the AI. Okay.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Thank you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then it also comes, we do have 24 seven support.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You can instantly chat with someone directly in your account. Also, they'll get on the phone with you as well. But, yeah.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  All right. Well, that answers everything I needed to know unless you have something else to share.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, I would just say, you know, at the end of the day, you know, a big reason that people sign up with us is not only that, you know, obviously, it sounds like we can fit all your needs. It's just, but also, it's just easy to use, right? You just download the extension, you connect that support folder to it and, you know, then you're basically, up and running at that point. So it's fairly easy to use, but it's also very powerful. And then, you tie that in with our 24 seven support. And then you'll be good to go.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. It.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Looks, it looks easy enough.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep, definitely. And we have a help portal, everything.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Yeah, I like that. It's right out of Gmail. We're we don't want to have to change to a new inbox. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yep. And then awesome. And then as far as your, yeah, you mentioned that, you can move, you potentially, would want, to move kind of fast on this one maybe, when makes sense for us to kind of reconnect here?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  I think let's say like Thursday or Friday. Okay. That'll give me time to connect with my boss and talk to her about it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. You want to do the same time as today on Thursday? So three PST?

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Me check my calendar.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Yeah, that works.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. I'll send you a new invite for then I'll email you in a little bit here, just kind of all the conversation, everything that we talked about today, and then, yeah, we'll talk on Thursday, but let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Okay, great. Thank you so much.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks, Kate. Bye.

Kate Swenson (kate@sendsites.com):
  Bye.
