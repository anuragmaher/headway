Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  the european?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you. I take care of sales at the european territory at hiver and I'll be your point of contact today. We'll run the show. I've been with the company like I said for about four years personally onboarded beyond 500 teams. So, yeah, we'll go through your needs that you did mention on your email. Yeah, we'll look into how hiver fits all of those. And I'll give you a quick walkthrough as well.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Amazing.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Anything in particular you would want me to be sure of. And then I'll put that in consideration and I'll walk you through the platform. Okay? Perfect.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  No, I think I sent the main points in the email yesterday. So if we kind of cover that and then I'll see the demo and if anything else comes up, I do have a list of aspects that we would want to know if it's capable. But I think in your demo, you'll cover that. So. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Yeah. Just, one thing that I do want to cross check is you said you have Microsoft as an email exchange provider, like you host emails on outlook today?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  No. So we use dynamics which is a product from Microsoft. It's like a CRM platform. So we were using that for a number of different reasons in the business, which is why our contact center reservations team was then also onboarded. So then our contacts and database was all in one place. But as we have off boarded now majority of the business into other platforms. We also want to do the same with our reservations team because at the end of the day, they're really just using it for email management of the shared inboxes. So we want to find a better solution. That is, you know, its main purpose is that like hiver, so we are just looking now and comparing what there is. Essentially. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So all I wanted to cross check is the emails are still processed through the Microsoft servers, right? Yeah. Okay. All right. And I'm also hoping the reservation team members have their logins for outlook because that's the interface they use. Do they have outlook logins or not?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Yeah. So they have their own email addresses and things. Yes. So they would be logging in for hiver, we would expect each individual to have their own email and log in, however the mailboxes they were applying to, they're like shared generic mailboxes because it's from, you know, our guests or clients that inquire in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. That's how it's going to be working. So, yeah, I will go ahead and give you a quick presentation on hiver. So give me one quick minute. I'm going to be sharing my screen perfect, all right. And anything in particular, like why are we looking at a solution at this point in time? Like you already had dynamics? I mean, is there any specific, you know, trigger that happened? Like you stopped using it altogether because of a specific reason or you always wanted to have a tool which is more easier than the dynamics ERP, yeah.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  So, as I mentioned, so dynamics was being used in the business across different functions, even sales and things like that, not for email management for other reasons, but we have been changing our tech stack and just putting in place more out of the box products that make more sense for the specific function. So, you know, a sales and catering platform for sales and so on and so forth. And when it comes to reservations because the reason they were using dynamics was because the rest of the business was on it essentially, but their main purpose for them is really the email management side. It doesn't make sense to maintain commercially dynamics because it's a much more costlier platform per user and also in terms of storage. And instead, we just decided to look at options that are more fit for business purpose, and also improve a bit on reporting because that's something a bit of a pain point at the moment. And they also want to have a bit more visibility on who's working on what, and have a better auto assignment as well. So that's one of the two kind of main key pain points that we have at the moment. But overall, it's mainly commercial reasons and to make sure we pick a fit for purpose platform.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, when it comes to the reporting, auto assignment, better like having to have a better visibility. The slas, email classifications, is that all possible in your current tool or was that a challenge or were there certain things we were not working? And I would like to show that to you in hiver as to how do we do that?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  So it was all possible. However, it was all custom built. So because it wasn't necessarily all of them functions that are native to the platform. At times, there have been some issues. At times it didn't work as well properly. So we're hoping that with a platform that has these aspects as more native as part of the product, we won't have as much uncertainty in terms of if it's working properly or have as much kind of error, I guess.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Let me quickly make a note of it. And you said this reservation team is a team of 15 people all in all today?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Correct. So there are 15 today and that includes both management supervisor level as well. However they are planning to expand to potentially up to 25, but that is within the next 12 months. So the reason why that's key is more we obviously want to start a plan with maybe your platform, maybe an upfront one. But we also want to make sure that we can then, you know, move up or ensure that the plan that we pick makes sense for our future as well. So of course, when we talk commercials and the options that we have, that's something that we want to just consider as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. Yeah, I get it that, hey, whenever we are looking at any of those solutions, if we happen to choose one, it should be scalable enough. We're just not looking at 10 to 15 people today, but we're looking at scaling it up like perhaps from the commercial standpoint, the efforts, the onboarding or whatever it takes, right? So I get it. I understand your point. OK, fair enough. Now, any timelines on this project? Like when are you moving away from dynamics altogether? When are you expecting a new tool to kick in? And so that your reservation team should be like all good and ready to, you know, start working on it. What timelines are we looking at?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  So we are planning to decommission dynamics altogether. At the end of February. We don't necessarily expect to already have the platform that we pick up and running because we know those are short timelines. But ideally, the sooner we selected, the sooner we want to start the process with the vendor we choose. I am having two calls with two other vendors as well. I had one this morning. I have another one on Monday. So within the next week or so, we would want to kind of have all the demos in place, have all the information so we can discuss internally for selection to be honest. So I would say in the next couple of weeks, so we want to move reasonably quickly. So we avoid that gap between decommissioning one platform and onboarding to the next. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. Yeah. I mean, you're saying in case we're able to make a decision by February, nothing like it. It's a good timeline for you to kind of pick all the threads and, you know, connect all the dots fair enough. And in terms of decision making on a tool like this, could you tell me which team in particular would be making a decision? Would that be directly coming in from the CFO for the budgets approval? Or do you already have budgets in place or would that be like a manager from the reservations team? Because I know you hail from product management. I know you'll be like a lot technical in terms of setting them up or maybe try and see if these platforms, do, you know, pick all of those, you know, button marks or not. But are you involved in decision making or somebody else is going to be along with you?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  No. So I'll be involved as long as you're the CIO. So we're discussing already, he knows exactly who I'm meeting with and we obviously already looked at the website. So we have a sense of the commercials that are involved. And then the final decision will most likely sit with our CEO if for just for final approval, that, that's the platform we're going with. So the approval process should be reasonably quick as well. Yeah. Oh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. All right. I'm glad to know that you are your CIO, you said CIO, right? Information officer already knows about the platforms and they personally sent you to have a quick look at it because that's your project, I believe.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Yes, one of them, yes, correct. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. All right. Great. So basically, you'll be the, you know, catalyst here, try and see if this works or not present it internally. We'll work together to kind of see if CIO or, you know, CEO probably have any more questions we address all of that. Everything looks good. We'll be talking to them to kind of have a decision. So it's not a huge long process or a hierarchy. It's like a straightforward thing and you'll assist. Yes, exactly. So.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  We've decided we want to move away and have something else. So it's really fit for purpose and see which of the three vendors make the most sense. Yeah, all.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. No worries. I mean, I think I have pretty much everything that I needed to know. I'm in a good space at this point in time. Let me quickly go ahead and share my screen. We'll quickly go ahead, look at how hiver functions. And should you come across any more questions during the presentation, maybe you could just park the questions or ask me immediately. We'll answer all of those. If I don't find the answer, I should be able to have one of my support engineers join us. I'll take care of your technical queries as well, but yeah, most of it, I think I should be able to do that. Lovely, please confirm if you're able to see my screen here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes. Okay. Now, right on the top, if you notice I'm in app, hiver, it's a web interface, doesn't matter which browser, where exactly your team is sitting, which corner of the planet, anywhere. All we require is the access to the internet. I'm logged in into my hiver account using my outlook test login. So that was the reason to understand. If your team, your reservation team already has their individual logins. We don't have to create anything as such in the ecosystem for outlook. All we do is just simply use those logins authenticate their login once and as per their availability, as long as they are keeping themselves online, they are ready to work on the tickets. And on the top here, under conversations, you have your personal inbox. So this inbox has all those tickets and emails that are sent to me personally. So if Carolina writes an email to Rakesh at hiver, I would see those emails in the inbox. If I write an email to you, if your boss writes an email directly to you. So these are my private emails. The way we manage them in outlook, it's pretty much the same.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  But these.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Emails are not shared amongst the team because that's private to me right at the same time. If you notice we're going to be taking this example of reservation support, a shared inbox setup right within the one screen where you have all brand new requests coming in. The unassigned. Hiver is able to tell you whether these are resolution overdue. Are we delayed already for the responses? What email is this about? Is this a warranty, something to do with the refund request claims, these tagging? And on top of it, hiver also is able to read the exact tonality of the email and give you a sentiment analysis stating it's a Smiley on the email. It's an angry customer, positive customer. I'm not sure if I did not turn it on at the back end, but I'll show that to you. Now, let's say these are the brand new requests. Nobody looked at it in your team. You open the request, look at what it is about. And from here, you either choose to assign emails. But on top of it, you had a request, where can we auto turn on the assignments and make sure hiver round robins, these emails, we can absolutely do that wherein emails would never go to unassigned but always be assigned into the mind section directly. So all I would do is care to log in into hiver with my logins, be available for emails and straight off go into mind section and see these are the emails that I need to work for a day?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Great. And just a question on that. Could we say who can work on what type of emails or some sort of type of categories or specific mailboxes because I think they have about maybe 10 if not, or something like that. So just want to make sure we can.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I tried to refrain not to, you know, take people into the admin inbox directly but you come from product, you definitely understand a lot more than a lot of people that I talk to. So, yeah, I mean if you look at the back end of the system, when I go into the automations, workflow, create one for you real quick. I would say any email that has a quick subject that contains refund, or any email that has a specific body that contains anything to do with the test keywords, can be assigned to a specific set of people, right? I can say assign it to Rakesh because these are the emails he's supposed to work on. And you automatically also add a tag that it is a billing email for that example, or when we receive emails from a very specific vendor that contains hiver, you know, anytime anybody contacts from hiver, you always need to assign emails to Carolina. So you could do all of those, right body to CC subject and all of that. Now, this is a very specific conditioning that can work. And no emails will then land into the unassigned. But apart from that, even if there is a new email which does not meet any of these criterias, you can still go ahead, turn on the auto assignment and make sure to exclude the supervisors and managers who are not supposed to work on the regular emails on operational day. And then the remainder of the emails will still get automatically assigned to the rest of the team members as long as they are online. Like when I showed you the online availability on the round Robin fashion. So we know at the end of the day inside our conversation panel here. When I'm looking into the support for reservation, the team section clearly tells you how many members are working on what sort of emails. So have a complete visibility and a distribution of workload. So it tells me Rakesh is working on these four tickets. Now, imagine Carolina, if I take a day off, my boss can see this four emails which are absolutely important without dealing a response, can actually go ahead and say, Cole, can you take this up? And that's how simple it is to just kind of allocate and triage the workload without forwarding these emails to each other. And otherwise, also if there is something which Elias is working on and it's super important. I look at the email, what is the context? I summarize the conversation because I don't want to go through all the chain of email threads. This is real quick for me. Within one second. I can literally see what's happening. I can be the owner of the ticket, reply to my customer. On behalf of Elias and I would say, hey, Elias, while you were away, I took care of your customer query. Don't worry whenever you're back. Just have a look at it. And from here, I could just say looks like a refund query, right? So I can just go ahead and hey, thank you for contacting me. We'll be working on it. This is a reply. I can go ahead and maybe improvise on or off, maybe make it more professional, whatever that I do want to do it, right from here. And then from here, I can send the conversation. Now close the ticket because I've worked on it and I've resolved it. The resolution is done. It then moves into the closed bucket for us. Now, anybody in your team can go into the closed, do a quick search the way we search for any conversation and you have a complete visibility in all the closed conversations. Now, imagine if this customer again responds probably in three months down the line, two days down the line, you would still see those emails coming up opened up in the mind section automatically because I was the owner, it was assigned to me and we have an ongoing conversation and a connect with the customer.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Okay. Amazing. Yeah, that's going to be, that was going to be my question. So you could see the historic information conversation and it can be assigned to the same person.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. And I assume if the,

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  person left the business, you would just assign?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  To the next absolutely. Absolutely. And even if I need to step into somebody else's job because they are not available, I still have the option to summarize the conversation instead of poking, I could just, you know, call my colleagues say, hey, Jeevan. Do you know what's happening or I would just summarize it right? From here, pick the conversation up and simply reply.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And how?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  About, sorry. Go ahead.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Go ahead. Sorry. Oh.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  How about escalations, let's say I need to check something with my supervisor before I send anything out. Can you talk people or how does that work?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Now escalations can work for different customers in a different fashion. For me. An escalation could be resolution overdue. Nobody has responded, customer has been waiting. We have not been able to resolve it. Now. Such emails could be looked upon from the analytics or I would just go into the views section and I would see what all escalations are right there. So I can just tag those conversations and create a view for myself. A lot of my customers say another escalations could be not just that we are dealing the response, but also when we need to coordinate internally with my boss and I need to get something approved while I do. So I reply to this or any of those emails, but I have an option to save a draft. So when I save a draft and I just add mention my boss, hey, Cole, do you want to just look at the draft saved? Is that the right way to look at it? That's when my colleague Cole, my boss, Cole will get a notification on the bell. We'll get an option to simply look at the drafts, also make further changes to the draft, save it for a cache I can build on top of it. And then I can send it over to the customers. Excellent. So there are multiple ways either I talk to them on chats here, without forwarding emails to them or I just simply draft a response. And I would say this is a type one or type two, whatever the email is. And then I save it and add mention my boss and that's when they can actually go ahead and make further changes and I am able to collaborate internally, right?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  And I assume we can also save let's say documents. If we have proposal documents and things like that, we could save that into attach.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. When you do the templates, you create the templates, you give it a name. You have all of those options to kind of go ahead and do the attachments as well. So you can go ahead and do all of those. You can create these folders, share these folders with your team. As in when you receive these emails, your teams should be able to just pull these templates right from the support itself. Like when I'm replying, I have the option to pull the templates from here. So these are the sales. Okay. This is a reminder for my customer and it can have attachments also.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Okay. And we could type those in different languages ourselves.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. As long as your keyboard has been supporting different languages, you can use these, you know, comments here in different languages. You can save these templates. Your customer communication can happen in different language. Only thing that may not really change is the admin setup that says the assign status, all of these custom fields, which is like, okay, what's the escalation type? Is that an email about warranty problem? Or is that something to do with, you know, pre sales query, who is the vendor we are working with? All of these are the custom fields. This may not really change because it's the admin part of things, but the interface with regards to the customer communication can be done in a native language.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Okay. Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Apart from that, when I'm done, I close the conversation. Like I move on, I simply look at all the closed in the closed bucket right here. And any conversation which is deliberately kept on hold, it is right there in pending. So we have got a status called pending, imagine a use case where I requested a refund because I wanted to cancel a service and Carolina is trying to save the deflect the sale because you don't want to cancel it. You want to understand if there is something that, we could do better and for that, I could use this stage called pending. Neither we are keeping this conversation in open nor we are closing it, but it's something to do with on hold like for a time being I'm getting it approved from my boss if we could just do a 10 percent discount and customer agrees to stay back. That's what the pending stage is for. Either we are working on our end to respond back to the customer or I ask customers some documentation and they're yet to get back to me. So I would say pending use a tag, maybe customer I'm awaiting a response from the customer. So I could use a tag called awaiting response, give it a color. So that when I'm looking into the pending view here, I know why exactly people have kept tickets in pending. So this is an escalation, client number one for cash is working on it. Let's just check out what's happening, and then again summarize the conversation. And you get a zest of why we have kept it in pending. Okay. Again on pending, when there is a new response from the customer, it again automatically triggers into the open section. So I know in the mind section, if I were waiting for a customer response and they respond back, the pending stage would automatically be changed to open. So I have everything in the mind section to work on it.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Perfect. And can we categorize emails based on importance, urgency, have slas and things like that? Yeah, these.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Are the tags that were supposed to come to it? However a lot of my customers use different labels to categorize emails, triage, emails. We can absolutely do. So one, we can use these tags. These are the test tags for me. But it can always be anything that you require because you would know what category of emails you receive today. And on basis of it like we have basic mine, unassigned team views, you can always create a very specific view on basis of the tag. Let's say any email assigned to anybody in your team has a very specific status either open or pending because the teammates are working on it. And this is about the refund request. So I know all my refund requests can actually go into a specific view and I prioritize my view call, this is a refund emails. And that's when I would be able to categorize this under a specific folder. That, hey, these are the refund emails. So that's where I will be able to simply manage my exact workflow. But otherwise you want to ask me how many refund emails are there? You don't have to go talk to your team. All you do is you simply pull a tag called refund. It will tell you these are the four conversations. How many escalations? Can I just simply see? Okay, these are the level one escalations, and these are the level two escalations. So you have a complete visibility on sorting your data, literally, looking at how you exactly want to organize the information. And the best part is it's not just controlled by the administrator. Any individual operationally can try and make their own views. They can try and look at how they want to manage their days because everybody would have a different style of working. So it's just not one person's you know, like management is trying to do all of that. It is completely flexible solution. Okay?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  And could we have some sort of like dashboards, for example, an agent dashboard, a supervisor dashboard? So everything is already there? They don't have to keep going to the views?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes. Now, when you see the dashboards, I'm assuming if this is just the analytics and reporting, I could show all of that. But if it comes to, on a regular day basis, when I need to work on the tickets, I would just go into the support inbox and just keep looking at the mind section and the team section. So for me, there won't be a dashboard here as such for me, it would all be reflected right here. I mean, all the mind tickets that are opened up, all the tickets which are not even assigned to people. These are the ones just lying in the table. Nobody looked at it. And the ones in the team section that are opened up for the entire team. So for me, that's going to be the entire dashboard like a agent dashboard. Okay?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  And what if you want to place a follow up? So let's say you reply, send a reply, you want to place a follow up and it's now in pending. And if you want to come in the morning and see how many things you have to follow up on?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, for that, all you do is just simply go ahead, create your own personal space view and say the ones which are assigned to me, enter the pending. All I want to do is just simply save a view and say this is Rakesh's pending.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Okay. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. And that's how I would just simply go ahead, look at the ones which are just mind pending every day. I look at mind section and the ones which are mind pending. So that's how I get to see that these escalations are super urgent. Let me just get done with these ones. Okay. Yeah, apart from that, there is a quick automation trigger. I can think of. Maybe if I could just, you know, suggest my recommendation will be more like when I know that I need to follow up. Maybe I'm waiting for a customer who hasn't responded in about two days, what I can then do is if there is no change in the response from my customer and the external conversation, okay, status is updated and the status is let's say, you know, pending. And then what you also see is there is no response from the customer. I would say, I mean external reply received. So there's a quick condition that says, if there is no response from the customer in about 48 hours, then can we literally go ahead and select a trigger? And that could be something like you want to send a response, you want to send a notification. All of that is also very much possible. Then you add an action and say you want to send a quick response to the customer that, hey, we're waiting for 48 hours. Is there anything else that you or that you are, you know, longing on to? And that kind of helps us with the quick follow up without manual interventions?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  And then.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Regularly, how you set up SLA is like what is the first response time? How long do you take to kind of wait for customers emails to go out, sit on, you know, four hours for the first response, 24 hours to close a ticket. And if there are any specific conversations with regards to the escalations, you can always say these escalation tickets should not wait for four hours. These are like 30 minutes conversation no matter what. So you can always choose to have different SLA's different policies on different emails. That's how you could just say notify the management users, whoever gets delayed. And then you have a due soon notifications. This is like a reminder that you have got two more hours to go on this sort of email because you have an SLA of four hours and all. So you could just set up all of that again, something to do with the customer satisfaction. I'm not very sure if this is important. Like whenever you close a ticket automatically, it triggers a quick satisfaction service, something like this, whether you're happy, sad or not or you just want to have maybe, you know, a text snippet, are you open to recommend our services? So this will be more like a snippet at the bottom of the email, which is very handy when you actually trigger a customer satisfaction. For an example, this is how it would look like when I reply to the customer email, right? From the email, there is a quick insert of a customer satisfaction at the bottom of the email. Now, this is me manually doing it, but whenever I close a ticket, it can also trigger automatically.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Okay. I don't think it's one of our requirements, but if it's included in the plan we end up selecting, then it's always nice to have.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Anything else in particular? I mean, I want to make sure that I keep revolving around your use cases and we don't look at so many other functionalities which may not really make a lot of sense because there can be a lot of tools doing 100 things. But this is what you wanted and let me know if this is in line with your requirements. Yeah.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  I think, I just want to understand when you close a ticket. Is there a section where we can add some sort of notes in terms of what was agreed, was kind of everything exactly?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And this is one of those notes where you can add mention and talk to your colleagues also. But here in these, you know, custom fields, what I can show you is something which is very specific to your need, but I'm actually into the reservation support and I go into the custom fields. I can add a custom field and choose a text and this field could be.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  So you could do like closing remarks, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Specific. Yeah… customer note or whatever that you want to just say, you know, closing note or whatever. Okay? And when I turn this on, you get to see it right on the ticket that you can just, you know, use it while you're closing it. And people can actually make sure that they keep their information handy while they're closing it for an example like this. So you can use make use of this section.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  I think the only other thing I would maybe want to just have a quick look at is your analytics. So the reporting that's out of the box and, you know, can we create our own version of reports or is that only a specific plan? So just.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Trying to understand that you'll be amazed to see the kind of reports that we offer. It is so vast right inside the analytics dashboard. You go ahead and search for the date range. Let's say, I'm looking at last 30 days, I care about the reservation support, basic conversation report under workload will tell you how many active new resolved emails do we have for the entire support team? What is the first response? How long we take to assign emails response and resolution time? Now that's a holistic report. Now, I can still go ahead and analyze it further and say, can I find it as for the different tags, what category of emails we've been getting and who has been working on all of these reports? So this is very much on the conversation level. One step deeper. When I dig deeper and understand what my users are up to, that's when I would see the users report assigned emails versus worked upon by these folks. Now, can I see what Rakesh is up to in last 30 days? He got 11 conversations only worked upon five. First response is 263 hours. Definitely a concern. So this is where you could just literally see the performance of your customer agents. On top of it. What category of emails we've been getting? Is that a cancellation refund escalations requests, proposals? Whatever, right? All of those are active, new result under different tags. Remember, we talked about the different tags and we automatically categorize those tags. So this is exactly what you could see and see how long we take to work on these escalation requests.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then on top of it, the ones which are already escalated, the first response violations, where we haven't been able to resolve the conversations, first response, compliance resolution, compliance. Now, while we miss to respond to these emails, can I understand what emails are these? And I can go ahead and say, help me understand with the tags now refund escalation, and these kind of emails violated the first responses. And I could literally see all of these emails as well. Like when I click here, it takes me to the same email in conversation. Okay, perfect. Anything to do with a very particular report which is not available out of it, you could go ahead and create your own report so you have got all the variety of actions, new conversations been assigned to anybody in your team, has a specific status because we want to just find out reports on the closed ones even if there is an email which is removed from your support inbox, but you still want to know retrospectively what happened in the past. You want to find out if this conversation was inbound or somebody wrote an email escalation, is there or whatever delivery date? These are all the custom fields by the way, on basis of how you can customize your own reports, you can further export these reports. It could be done in CSV and you'll be literally amazed to see these are the level of, you know, depth to which you can actually look at the reports. Perfect.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  No, that's great. I think it covers the reporting the business needed. So that's.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  really good.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  I guess my last question is on… integrations. Not that it's something that we necessarily want to go with directly straight away. But if we want to consider in future, is it just the ones you have that I can find on the website? Correct? In terms of phone platforms or CRM platforms, they're all listed there?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  These are the ones which are readily available, but should there be any new integration we're looking at, which is not a part of the list, we can always go ahead and request a one. We have the apis available. I have solution engineering team that we can look at, scope it out. If it is easy to go. Just maybe, you know, plug and push in the information. I think we should be able to do that. Okay?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Great. Yeah. As I said, it's not really a requirement or we wouldn't disqualify you in any shape or form. We just want to understand in terms of absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We have a, we have a technical support and development team for about 150 people all in all. So, it is not something, that we can think of not doing it as long as it's a valid use case. And a customer's like a lot of customers been asking for it. I don't find it's a problem. We, we do custom build also.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Great. Let me just see if I had anything else. I guess I don't know if it's in this call, if you want to arrange a separate one, but I would like to talk about more in terms of commercials plan that you would be suggesting. And also kind of implementation timelines from the date we'd sign, how long it normally takes, what supports and kind of onboarding you provide, and obviously after, and what support is included based on the plans and things like that. Absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, if you do not have a hard stop, we can go over for a couple of more minutes. Yeah, the pricing is super straightforward basis on what we discussed on the reports and functionalities. We can look at the pro plan annually which is priced at 65 dollars per login. And if you look at 15 people login, it's going to be 65 by 15. Now, this does include everything when it comes to set up your account, the onboarding, the team training, which does not include any additional cost as such. We have got a very dedicated onboarding plan. Let me just quickly share with you as to how what the onboarding would look like. Give me one minute if I could just pull and?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Can I just check is the growth? Would it still apply for the number of users we have, if we want to compare it or?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Now, the growth plan offers the eligibility up till the 10. So it's a ballpark at 10 people team now because if you're looking at 15 people team, we need to look at this plan. So that's number one, number two, the reporting is very limited in growth. You can just only have the reporting on conversation but reporting on slas, the tagging, the different level of criterias, the customizations of reporting is not possible within this slas, and business hours are also possible within this, which is not possible within the growth. So growth basically is like you and I are friends. We are starting a new E commerce and then all we want to care about is just not missing on conversation. We're a team of two, three small people team. So that's where, I would look at growth plan. But since you are already a 15 people team, I would say we are looking at a reporting, we are looking at a scalability, more integrations. All of that is a part of pro and also, the functionalities with regards to the auto assignments and the workflow, automations. No.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  That's fair. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And then with regards to the onboarding, we do like a complete onboarding from setting up the account to understand the use cases, to bring your team onto the table and then train them. We will assign a dedicated onboarding manager that will be the point of contact. And it totally depends upon when your team is available. When you are available to set this account up, the amount of efforts it may, you know, take two calls, three calls, totally depending upon as, and when we set it up. And then again, I have had teams like your size, get started with hiver totally onto it in no more than a week or two. I mean, that's how simple the solution is. It's more like a login plug in start go even, if you notice the interface, it's one of those easiest you would look at. Yeah, I.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  guess it's just the time to set up our rules and things like that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Which zero learning. Yeah. And that's the admin side of things. And that's where my onboarding manager will come into play where your team does not need to learn anything, right? And.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Then onboarding. Okay. Amazing. Okay. Yeah. In terms of, and then I guess because it includes the full onboarding, you would also be training the team. So you wouldn't have to do some sort of train the trainer. Okay, great. Absolutely.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Perfect. And that is annual. Okay. That's the annual building. Okay? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's the annual.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And, this is how the complete onboarding would look like. I can share this with you when in the phase one, we do kickoff and scoping try and con, you know, do configure your hiver train, optimize onboarding completion. And then this is exactly what it would take and we are just not going to be limiting to our, these minutes. I mean, this is just like a benchmark.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Of course.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But it does take care of the complete team training and then check ons on monthly and quarterly evaluations, try and make sure that your team is actually making the best use of the platform and then we recommend the best practices also.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Right. Yeah. If you could share that.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  And I guess my only question is because we're discussing the pro pack and because onboarding is included, I assume you don't have any sort of one off implementation fees. It's just.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  There is no hidden cost at all. Yes.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Amazing. I.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Wanted to be very clear about it. There are so many players out in the market that would have the onboarding cost that would have the implementation cost. We are none of those, ours is like a plain subscription cost. Onboarding is no cost additional. There's no setup cost, no setup fee at all. No installation also. Okay. Perfect. And,

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  that is, I think that makes sense. I guess my only question is on sort of data retention and storage. Assuming that pack that plan, do you have a specific limit on how much we can keep for how long and things like that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, if I go fundamentally point zero, the actual emails are still going to be processed on your outlook servers because remember, we talked about the shared email box that's yeah, it's just a mailbox setup. Now when it comes to management of your emails, when it comes to, you know, having to have notes, comments, you're processing emails, there is as such no limitation on data storage as long as your outlook is processing those emails, you're using hiver as a functionality for communication management, there is no limitation on data storage as such. Okay?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Perfect. Great. And I assume you just have any sort of, you know, basic support if we ever have any issues. And so on the subscription plan includes support as well. Yeah, we are.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The only vendor, in this domain that does offer 24 to seven even if it is the support that you require early morning during your breakfast hours, you have got online agents available. So we do offer 24 to seven support. I'm yet to find support which is 24 seven with Zendesk folks. I did sell a quite close competitor to Zendesk back in 2011, 1,213 14. But, yeah, I mean, I take pride in it and I can share a lot of reviews from our customers that absolutely love.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I mean, a lot of customers been transitioning to hiver because we are a support people of more than 24 people. At this point in time. They're just doing 24 seven support. Be it customer coming in from Philippines versus us or the UK? Perfect?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  No, sounds great. I… think those were, I think there's like the initial questions that I have at the moment. Yeah, perfect. Lovely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We'd like to share the recording of our conversation with you. Should you wish to go ahead internally, have a discussion with your CIO and CEO, also share a couple of customer testimonials from your same space as to how they love hiver on onboarding, talk bit more information on the pricing again.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you want to be very sure of things in case this happens to be a product of your choice and you are having to have a set budget? Do let us know we are open. We are flexible to discuss that for my customers. Pricing always happens to be the last point of concern. Should not be a benchmark. I would say even if it comes to, you know, some sort of flexibility, I'm open to look at it because we're just not looking at one, two or four licenses. We're looking at a team of 15 with the potential of having to have a team of 25. So I'm open to have a discussion around that part also.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Great. That's good to know. Perfect. Amazing. Yeah. So as I said, I'm just having a few additional conversations beginning of next week. So within the next two weeks, if not next week, I'll come back to you and we go from there, absolutely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And mind telling me who all are we? We're going to be looking at it? I mean just curious, yeah.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Sure. So we're talking to missive, and we're also talking to front got.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It very clear. Yeah, missive. Honestly, I mean, I hear about front and missive almost every day. Missive is not even a company of 10 people. So kind of imagine the support and onboarding you might expect or receive towards the end of it. Just keep that in mind. We are a series B funded company with over, you know, 27,000,000 funding front. Yes, a very good product, a little complicated because I've used front in the past, but I would go ahead and have a quick look at. It definitely will come to a conclusion. And of course, it's going to be our decision. I'll help you facilitate it, help you with the resources. Maybe I can share a quick help article also like how we compare ourselves to front people, if that comes to it.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Sure. Sounds good. Perfect. Is.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That, is that okay? If we set up maybe a quick 10 minute meeting sometime next to next week? I know by next week, you'll be having your own time to look at some competition. But maybe if we could connect in the second week of February that'll give us a good idea about where we stand with. Yeah.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Let's say that maybe on the Tuesday and then if for any reason I have information earlier, I'll just drop you an email and we can, I'm.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  going to be giving you access to edit the invite pre, pone, the meeting, suggest me a new timing. So you'll have the control and the flexibility. But for now, what we're going to do is maybe put the same time for about 10, 15 minute of a quick catch up on Tuesday, which is tenth of February, if that sounds okay?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  I have something at two PM, but either from three onwards or from 11 to 12 works for me. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I think pretty much the same time as now or maybe 15 minutes earlier than this?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Right now, no, because I'll have a call between two… and three.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. We can connect earlier. How about one UK? Yes?

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  That's fine. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Let me quickly check. Yeah… I can do one. So let me just quickly push for a quick meeting for about 15 minutes. I'll say hybrid placeholder feedback meeting. Perfect. All right. Should there be any more questions? Like I say I am the point of contact for you? Just an email away from you. Feel free to write back right after this conversation. I'll, sum up the conversation, do a quick summary for you, send you the recording along with the onboarding document and bit of pricing also. Perfect.

Carolina Sarmento (carolina.sarmento@edyngroup.com):
  Sounds great. Thank you so much for your time, lovely.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you so much for your time as well. Enjoy the rest of your day. Have a good weekend ahead bye.
