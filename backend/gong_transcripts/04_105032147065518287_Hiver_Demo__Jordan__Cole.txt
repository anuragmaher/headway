Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Jordan, Jared naughty.

JordanF:
  Hello?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  What's going on guys? How are you?

JordanF:
  Good. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Doing well, doing well. Apologies for the delay. I had a call that ran a bit over. Hi, Cole. Hey, what's up? Adi, great. Thank you. But I appreciate, you know, you guys hopping on the call here today. So just to set a quick agenda for the call, we'd love to start with a round of introductions, understand, you know, everyone's role kind of what got you interested in hiver, then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions.

JordanF:
  Okay. You know, I'll just, I'll start. So we're an international moving company and we deal a lot of, with emails whether we're emailing internally or emailing externally, and it's gotten to a point where I felt like it's a lot of emails and just did a… and actually found another company. And then I don't know somehow it led to you guys. So yeah, we just wanted to see what you have to offer, see if it helps, see if it makes sense for us because I'm sure if we, I think we need a system that does something like this, but I'm sure it'll be a big learning curve and it'll be a big, you know, kind of shock to the system if we change things up, but I'd like to hear what you have to say.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, that's I really appreciate that insight that's helpful. And just to understand further, you know, what how many different emails are you managing as an organization today? Like whether it's distribution lists, shared inboxes, can you kind of shed some more light on that?

JordanF:
  Yeah, we have… just under 20 people here. And to be honest, most of it is other than an info email, most of it is actually they're all kind of private accounts.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So they're individual emails?

JordanF:
  Yeah. So let's say we have a rating department. We'll have three people on the rates team and the three of them use their own emails instead of like a generic instead of like a shared account. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, you're looking to be able to manage people's personal emails and understand like how they're performing individually, like response time and all that stuff. And like what they're working through workload. Is that what you're trying to understand better?

JordanF:
  That, and also, I think that we can, I mean, the three let's say if three people are on our rates team and they each have their own emails, I really think it could be a shared account. And I think there's a lot of disconnect and problems by not having that, you know, it's a lot of like, oh, did you answer this or can you answer this? And there's no real tracking. And… yeah, also, there's also some of the emails we get there's a lot of communication regarding those around those emails. So currently, we're just kind of like, you know, taking out somebody who shouldn't be in the email and then typing, then writing emails back and forth to each other, and then finally going back to the original email to reply to them. So I want to see about, yeah, getting rid of that concept.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, are you trying to move towards a shared mailbox model? Because just how hiver works? Is that's really how we foundationally help outlook clients. We're helping them manage distribution lists, shared inboxes, or those types of accounts to provide that collaborative environment as well as tracking mechanism. And I can show you what that looks like. Let me share my screen here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And y'all, can see my screen, right?

JordanF:
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So how hiver works is you're gonna log in with your Microsoft sso, okay? And it's gonna give you access to our platform where we're gonna help you manage, you know, one, your personal email communications, and then also your individual email communications. So on the left hand side, once it's finished logging in here, you're gonna see my personal inbox. So these are just like personal outlook communications that are being sent to me individually. And then we're gonna have those shared inboxes or distribution lists below. So customer support, team, sales, healthcare, HR operations. So teams use these because it just helps you consolidate that outreach effort to one spot. So it makes it easy from a tracking and processing perspective. Want to pause right here. Any questions?

Adi:
  So far? Yeah, yeah, I have a question. So the personal ones. So if, how would, how do you create the environment where someone is trained to answer personal emails and keep them in that folder versus shared?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, pretty much if you're just like, you know, if you just have your own personal company emails that you want to manage, that's essentially what this is for the shared is more for your team, for your teams that are working through like whether it's like accounts, payable accounts, receivable, an operations team, whatever it might be.

JordanF:
  Okay. But let's say an email comes to me to my personal email, but it should be in a shared let's say, in a shared sales email, can I then switch it out of my personal and bring it, into the shared?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I can do, hey, I'm going to take this personal email right here and add it to the support mailbox.

Adi:
  Okay. I'm going to take it, this question a step forward. Is there an AI that would identify certain language and move it, to a rates request box?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, not yet, that's eventually where we want to go. It's a great question but not currently in the product today.

JordanF:
  Okay. And let's say, we get a request that comes in and it's in a shared mailbox. And so, I'm assuming I can now tag somebody or I can assign it to somebody. But how do I now? Let's say we want to talk back and forth about this email? Is there, is there? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So on the email itself, right? I'm in the unassigned view. So when you click into these shared inboxes, there's the mind view, everything that's been assigned to me, the unassigned section, the emails that need to be distributed out. And then the team view. So this is where you can see what everyone on the team is working on in real time, what's outstanding and what needs to be completed.

JordanF:
  Okay. So, I understand that you don't have AI that can automatically recognize and say, hey, this should be in this shared mailbox, but are there rules that we could set, that if there's certain language, it goes to a certain mailbox or no, if?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It's from your, if, is it going to your personal email first?

JordanF:
  Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, there's no rules that we can do today, that is on our roadmap, just not something we can do today.

JordanF:
  Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We have it. So, we have another product for Gmail clients, where we have, we call it personal inbox and shared mailbox automation, right? Where it's like certain clients reach out to your personal inbox, it's automatically push it to that shared mailbox for that tracking, visibility and analytical purposes.

JordanF:
  Huh.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But, but not in, the outlook solution today, but definitely on the roadmap.

JordanF:
  So, wait, so, so you have it, for it's you do have it for Gmail, or just not or just not in general, we.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Have it for Gmail. And this product is catching up to me in parity with the Gmail product?

JordanF:
  Got it. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then we can do things like track assignees, track the status, whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks. Adding those tags for organizational purposes, to put these conversations in buckets, folders, or views. We can also provide analytics on these tags to understand why people are reaching out, track custom data like dropdown fields, date, range, fields, or text box fields to find to, you know, report on additional information and collect it from the clients.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I.

Adi:
  have a question. So, when you have, let's say an email that came in and you need to keep track, of everything that happened, in that particular subject matter. So, let's say there's a rate request that turned into a move, the move, had went through, you know, all these different logistical, operational, hoops until it got to the very end, and then you want to get just kind of a recap of the whole conversation in, you know, vertical, and horizontal to just grab everything in one shot. Can you grab all those emails that are related in all the internal messaging?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, the way that we're able to do that is with tags. So, are you saying like being able to like organize conversations and search for them based on status or, where they are in progress?

Adi:
  So, no, basically, so, let's say, I'm going to take you, through a process. Okay? So, let's say a lead came into the company and, after some time, a salesperson reached out to the person and, you know, started communications with them back and forth and, let's say they closed the deal and they decided to do some logistical activity with us. Then it would go to the operations team. They would, you know, do all these different rate requests, and book all the different freights and form all the agents, involve, you know, steamship lines and everything, because we're in the logistic business. And at the very end, I'd like to see, to grab a file. Let's say this particular move, let's call it, move X and see all the communications that happened, in this. So I can see when, it came in, when did we respond? When did we do certain activities? How fast did we respond to all these different things? So I can examine that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, from an analytical perspective. Okay. Yeah. So, once it goes into the shared mailbox, we can provide analytics on those, tags or conversation types. So, for instance, like let's… say, an ap request came in or, you know, yeah, let's do an ap request here's, where you can see, you know, what was our average first response time to these requests? How long is it taking us to, overall respond throughout the conversation? And then the average resolution time, how long from start to finish to go through this request type?

Adi:
  But if I, but let's say, because, we have some, regulations, compliance, and they would actually want to see the emails and they would like to see the communication. So, if I wanted to see all the communications within one, shot that I can navigate between all of them? I'm able to do that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So see, this is every single associate conversation associated with the tag below over the last nine days and these, I could click into all these and see the threads?

Adi:
  Yeah. Okay. Jordan, go ahead.

JordanF:
  No, I was going to say, is there a way to save an individual conversation? Like, is there a way to download it or drag and drop it somewhere or have a link, to each conversation?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, right now, the best way to do that would just be to organize these conversation by tag types. We don't have a linking conversations tonight.

JordanF:
  Got it. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But just want to pause right here, team, like, what are your thoughts? I know the personal inbox is a huge, you know, a huge part of your evaluation, is that like a deal breaker for us, at this junction?

JordanF:
  No, look, we're trying to get away from, you know, certain, types of emails that we get a lot of, we, they should be in a shared mailbox, and I want to be able, to, communicate internally with the teams to talk about certain emails, you know, so, that, that's, why, I was led here. It, it's, I, it seems like you guys do it a little bit, but, you know, less on the automation side, and I don't know, I guess you work more based on, tags, I guess.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And we do have the collaboration too. So, if you want to collaborate internally on the side of a conversation, you can do that as well. So I shot this notification to matt, right? He'll receive that notification up top over here, click on it. You can use our AI summarizer to get up to speed on the conversation really quickly. And then even use our AI co pilot to draft a reply to the conversation.

JordanF:
  Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And our AI co pilot can pull from your internal documentation, to help your team respond more effectively efficiently. And I'll just insert this into the draft.

JordanF:
  Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, in terms of the admin side of the house, so, this is where we'll set up the platform, right? So, taking a look at the support share mailbox here, this is where we'll manage the members who are associated with the mailbox, the general round Robin, auto assignment that will equally distribute the work. And then automations. So we can create skill based automations, rule based automations, to do things like, you know, new conversation comes into the mailbox, we've identified in the subject line that there's the keywords, billing and quote, let's assign this to Rakesh and add the tag billing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, being able to leverage these automations to assign work, add tags for organizational purposes, send customized replies, and much more.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Any questions on, the automation team?

JordanF:
  No, I don't think so. Okay. You a D?

Adi:
  Excuse me, no?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, the last thing I want to touch on team, I know we're you know, we are coming up on time shortly is the SLA policies. So just being able to track your first response times and resolution times and seeing if we're meeting the goals that we have, you know, in logistics, I think speed and responding within an according amount of time is really important and this gives us that measurement to do so. So, let's say new, new conversation comes in and it is a high priority shipping request or a high priority logistics request, whatever it might be. We are going to have a first response goal of one hour and a resolution goal of 24 hours because this is a time sensitive situation and we can then choose people to notify if it is slipping beyond our slas?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, just a way to ensure that we're driving a good experience, we're meeting our deadlines and if things are falling between the cracks, we're escalating it to the right people.

JordanF:
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But, yeah, that's pretty much the main things I wanted to cover today. Team. We also do offer a free trial, that's what I do typically recommend as a next step. What are your thoughts on potentially kicking off a free trial next week?

Adi:
  When you're seeing a free trial to what degree like, is that like in a test environment?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It would be a live environment where you can actually test your own emails and set up your own inboxes and have live data.

Adi:
  Jordan, do you think we're ready for that?

JordanF:
  Next week, maybe not, but eventually, yeah, I'd want to do that and how does it work? We just, is it, does somebody walk us through how to, yeah. Yeah, yeah, so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For, for next call that's typically, what we'll do, I'll help you set it up with my solution specialist, and, we'll do a kickoff call. So, so next week wouldn't be good, but what about the week after? Let's say, same… time on the 20 fourth?

JordanF:
  I'd have to, I'd have to check and see if, if it's going to work, then, okay, yeah, I definitely do eventually want to, test… it out. So, I just want to be ready for it, and, have a lot of time.

Adi:
  You have a, is there a test environment where, we can try this instead of going live? Because let's say, if it's just, I want to play with it a little bit with Jordan and see how this thing works, how this, how it works instead of getting the whole company on it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that, that's fine. I can, we can create a sandbox too, that works and I can get that to you.

Adi:
  That's I think more appropriate at this stage.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's perfect. Why don't we do that? Could we touch base next week? Let's say, same time on Tuesday, so I can like walk you through the sandbox?

Adi:
  All right, Jordan.

JordanF:
  The Tuesday, what time is that? Three 30 Ish, sorry?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, three 30 to four esd?

JordanF:
  I think that should be fine.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, I'll just, I just sent it over for, same time on Tuesday for a quick sandbox sync. Okay. But I appreciate, you know, the time today team, it was great to meet you all. I'll start working on that for y'all right now, and I hope you have a great weekend.

JordanF:
  Awesome. Thank, you too. Appreciate it. Take care, take.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Care.

JordanF:
  Thank you. Bye bye.
