Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, hey, Iker, how are you?

Io:
  Good, good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I appreciate you hopping on the call here. So just to set a quick agenda, would love to do a quick round of introductions, you know, understand your role and what got you interested in hiver, then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and steps.

Io:
  I only have about 20 25 minutes before my next meeting. Okay? I am looking for, I am interested in combining communication. So I am looking into missive and hiver, the two competitors and I'm trying to make a decision today or tomorrow to pick a platform and start testing. Got it. We are an insurance agency, mortgage brokerage, like a small business with six, seven employees total with different business areas, different business names, all same, six, seven people. And we have different means of communications. It can be the text messages, phone calls, voice over IP with the webhooks available as well… emails, office.

Io:
  Communication platform. So we can track like assign, you know, tasks, do stuff like that for our clients, insurance policies on the standard as well. So, what I'm looking for is me in the I've seen the mr web demonstration. I want to see the competitor as well before I make a decision.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, are you looking to consolidate all those channels under one platform or are you really just looking for more of an email management platform? All?

Io:
  All under one channel.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So that's not something we can offer today. We're only able to manage chat and email today as a solution?

Io:
  Like chat as in whatsapp and telegram or something else?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So like live chat, so we can just do email and live chat today within our outlook solution?

Io:
  Okay. I'm not looking for an outlook solution I'm looking for like an external solution that gets everything together, right? So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that we're just not going to be able to do that today. So we're just transparently just not a fit for what you're looking for, but, I'll keep you posted as the product develops and I'll let you know once we're able to consolidate those other channels. Okay?

Io:
  Can you then delete my account so I can always get a trial in the future?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You, you want me to delete the trial?

Io:
  Delete the trial, delete the account so, I can come in like a new customer in the future when you guys have those features and I can do it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. 100 percent. I can definitely do that.

Io:
  But still keep in the loop please?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
