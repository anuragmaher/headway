Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  all good, Cole. Okay, cool. Thanks. Have a good one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, what's going on Joe?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Good. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. Where are you calling out of?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  We're in northwest Iowa.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, nice. Very cool. But no, I appreciate you hopping on the call here, Joe. So just to set a quick agenda, would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role at the school. What kind of got you interested in hiver, the problems that you're looking to solve? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, I can kick us off first here. So my name's Cole miller.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the email management, customer experience space for a little over six years now and yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can potentially help you all.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  All… right. I got, did you get in, Katie? I.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  was trying to get my assistant in here with us, but I think she's struggling.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  But anyways, yeah. So I'm just started an it director this year here at sioux central schools. I also it director for Clay central Everly schools. So the sioux central's K through 12. We got about 620 kids and then cce is K through six and they got roughly 45 kids there. So my department is essentially just me, Katie. My assistant is just getting transferred into my department here. So, so we'll be growing by two, but we were just kind of looking at either finding just something that we can use that's a little more efficient for a shared email and stuff. But like I said, we're pretty small, so that's why I was curious about what you guys had to offer that so we could look at it and see.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And so how many people did you say are currently managing inbox, just two today?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Right now, just two of us?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And it's what is it? Just like a general student, like query inbox or like something like that?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Yeah, we're just kind of setting up right now. Yeah, just kind of a IT inbox where teachers and staff and kids if there's issue can send it in and then we can assign it back and forth between the two of us on who needs to do what and all?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That got it. Got it. And how many… what's he going to say? And then, so you're hiring for an additional two people on the IT team to field through these tickets that's kind of like the future state?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then in terms of the email, are you using Gmail or outlook today?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Gmail?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah. So I can share my screen here team. And, hey, Katie. Nice to meet you. Hi. I can share my screen here and just kind of run you through a demonstration of hiver and then feel free to stop and ask any questions as we're going through it.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  All right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, taking a look at my screen, you know, what's nice about hiver is we are a certified Google partner, so we live within that workspace to help teams better manage Google groups, shared inboxes, whatever it might be. So taking a look on the left hand side here, you'll see customer success, inbox, finance, HR, operations, project support. So, these are the different inboxes that we're managing internally and you can just log in with your normal Gmail and have access to those communications on the left hand side. So I'll click into the support share mailbox. And when I do it's going to open up a sub, a couple sub views beneath it, that's going to help us manage the intake of communication. So, the first is the unassigned section, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be distributed via automation or manual assignment. Then there's the mine, everything that's been assigned to me. And then the team view. So here's where you can see what everyone on the it team is working on in real time from a ticketing perspective. And you can click on their names to understand who's owning what, and have complete visibility into the team. Just want to pause right here. Any questions so far?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  No, it all makes sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. So going into the unassigned, right? The goal is to have unassigned zero, I'll click into this email right here. So on the right hand side, a tab is going to pop up. This can be opened or closed or we can take a couple different actions around the email. So the first is assigning it. So I'll assign it to myself. Let the team know. I'm going to follow up with it. The next way we can assign work is a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the tickets or emails as they flow in amongst your it team. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So if certain people have certain skill sets handle certain questions, we can identify those query types and ensure the right questions are going to the right people. Then we can track the status, whether it's open pending or closed. You know, that ticketing functionality to ensure nothing slips between the cracks that we're working everything to a resolution, adding those tags for organizational purposes, for us to create folders or queues to understand where things are in status, what things we're working on over real time, and then custom fields. So drop down fields, date range fields, text box fields and value fields to view data, take action on it, report on it and search on everything within the platform. Want to pause on the panel here. Any questions on the statuses, assignees or custom fields?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  No, that makes sense to me.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. And then going down we'll have the notes section, right? Where we can collaborate internally with people on the it team. So I'll send this to Manoj just like asking him to come to the conversation. He'll receive that, you know, notification up top. He'll, click on it. It'll take him right to this thread where we can have this back and forth dialogue and how we want to respond to the student, you know, faculty, whatever it might be. We can use our AI summarizer to get up to speed quickly on the conversation. You can actually see how the, you know, the client or the interaction is currently feeling based on our AI sentiment analysis and then let's say we need more information to draft or apply. I can use our AI co pilot to then draft or apply based on the data sources that we feed it. So I'm going to select the second option here asking for more details.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then I can just insert this into the draft.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But just want to pause here team like what are your thoughts on this so far?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  No, I mean, everything so far is what I was looking to have it do for us here. It's just something where we can assign stuff back and forth and easier communication.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, for sure. And we have some good analytics as well. So, just like understanding what's going on from a performance and workload perspective. So seeing things like active new resolve conversations over a certain time period that we select, we can see what our average first response time was as a team or average resolution time, individual user metrics. So, how many emails or tickets have been assigned per user sent out per user? And then those individual performance metrics below. So it's showing, you know, what was my average first response time over the last 90 days? And Cole's average resolution time kind of stack ranking the team to see how everyone's performing. Okay. And then the tags I think are really helpful. Just so just understanding from an it team, what requests are we getting most often? You know, is it a hardware issue? Is it a password reset issue? Like whatever it might be? This will give you an understanding of, hey, why are people reaching out and how can we streamline what we're doing? Whether it's providing a knowledge base, providing better information through automations and stuff like that?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And I did notice the team was on the trial today. Did you have much chance to get in there, Joe and kind of test around the platform?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Yeah, we've been using a little bit here. We got started. I got it all set up over the weekend. So we've been using some here just to test it out.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how's it been going so far since you started working with it?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  It was going fine.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. And I see the trial is ending. Yeah, end of this week, do you know when ideally you'd want to make a decision on a solution like this? Just kind of curious on your timeline and expectations.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Let's see probably here within the next couple of weeks. I got to talk to admin about stuff because I want to see if there's other departments that are interested in this and then what their opinion is on it too.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I can extend your trial to you, Joe, just to give you more time to kind of do your internal due diligence and just give you more time to test.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So I just extended it by an additional 10 days which will give you to November nineteenth to kind of further test and just have those conversations internally?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But when would be a good time for you to touch base? Like happy to serve up a call to understand, you know, how the trial is going, answer any questions you might have? When would be a good time for you just to like do like a 30 minute connect?

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Oh, we could probably do one either Tuesday. So either the end of this week or early in the next week. Let me look at my schedule. I have no idea what it is. Yeah, actually, Friday and Monday for this week and the beginning next week are both open for me. So those would probably be good times.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And I can do same time as now on Monday if that works for you.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Yep.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. And I can share some more information with you as well. So if you want to share, you know, our value proposition across departments, I can share you like a product deck, product, demo, stuff like that. So people can kind of just review it and, get a take on it.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Yeah, sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, no, it's nice to meet you, Joe and Katie. So I'll follow up with some more information after this, but I hope you all have a great rest of your week and we'll talk next week.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  All right. Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Thank you. Okay. See you guys.

Joseph Mohr (jmohr@siouxcentral.org):
  Bye.
