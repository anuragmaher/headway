Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hi, Steve.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Hey, how's it going?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good. Thank you. Good morning, sir. How are you doing?

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  I'm doing well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Thank you for joining in and apologies for the last time of reschedule. I understand we were running out of time and I had been double booked by then. So, yeah, apologies again, sir.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Yeah, no problem.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And I'm glad I'm talking to you today. Let me quickly introduce. My name is rukhansh, and I take care of sales at hiver for a bit, part of the european territory, as well as some part of the us. I have been with the company for over four years, personally onboarded more than 500 teams. So we'll be looking at your requirements today, go over all the needs, look at if this is a good solution for yourself. OK? Sounds good. Lovely. Now, before we begin, do you want to tell me what made you look at hiver sir?

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Yeah. So we're a trucking and logistics company.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  I've been with them about 15, 17 years, something like that. I don't know if, you know, trucking is not a great spot right now. So we've laid off probably about half of our internal employees but maintain the same number of truck drivers and trucks and things. So basically we're doing twice the work with half the people. So in the past, the way we worked with email was we had several customer service reps and several dispatchers, and we have an alias for each customer essentially who then we would, I would put, you know, the correct employees into those aliases and then, you know, if we had to change them down the line, I would. So we're talking several 100 different aliases that I manage. Now that we're down to basically four people in our operations team. It's no longer working the way it used to where we used to separate who was handling. What essentially now everybody kind of handles everything… but it's gotten to the point where they're asking me how I can figure some way out to make this work to where everybody's not seeing everything all the time. Basically, they're wanting some people to get some email during a specific day versus a specific time to which I told them. I have no way to do that without manually going in which there's no way I could do that. So, I'm trying to figure out if there's some kind of shared mailbox type functionality that can help us in some fashion where they're not having to manage, you know, basically we got one Guy that works two hours extra in the back of the day versus the front of the day. So, is there a way that he can only manage, you know, a mailbox just for a couple hours? And otherwise he's doing his normal stuff. So I don't know if this will solve anything or not. I'm just, you know, kind of out there looking to see if there's some kind of solution other than me trying to figure out a way to how I can set it up for them to be honest.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. Steve. I completely get it. I understand where you're coming in from and I completely understand. I mean, it's probably not the best in, I mean phase at the moment where there has been a lot of losses in the trucking industry. I get it. I completely get it. Now at this point in time, you said you've got four people in operations?

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Correct.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And do we have one common inbox email address where you receive all of these requests today?

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  So, no, no. So currently, we encourage our customers to use the one customer email that they have. So that we're not getting email in from, you know, dispatch ops. So we do have an ops mailbox which is kind of a wide open. It goes to everybody… but we, you know, instead of our customers using that, we ask them to use their specific. So if, it's Nissan at shipsts. Com. That way we can manage internally who gets those emails. And so right now, that's what they're using. So if we want to revert we would have to switch them. They don't use that one. Now, use basically what's happened is that Nissan mailbox, basically all four of them get it. And that's fine. What they're asking me is, okay, josh only needs to see that mailbox when he's on call on the weekend maybe. But during the rest of the week, he doesn't manage the Nissan account. The other three people do. Got it. Now, the only way I can do it is if I went into each customer's mailbox every weekend on a Friday and put him in and then take him out on a Monday again, which when you have hundreds, it's not.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Scalable. Sir. Yeah.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  No, no, it's not. It's easier to just leave them in and say, well, hey, just ignore them. Don't work on?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  This one or ignore this email. But that's again. So manual that.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  We can or set up local rules to where he can say, okay, well, I'm going to send these to a Nissan mailbox. And now, I know I have to manage my inbox, but also this Nissan mailbox during certain times, which again, it's not a great solution either. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Absolutely. Now, I've got a solution for you. I think that's going to be working out okay for you. I've worked with a lot of logistics teams by the way. I mean we work with arrive logistics from UK. Flexport has been one of our biggest clients in the logistics space. So, yeah, I mean, let me quickly share.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  I know arrive's gone to. I think they've gone to all kinds of AI phone stuff. I know we get calls that sound like AI calling me.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no worries, sir. Let me quickly share my screen and tell you what exactly we can do to help you manage your support emails. So basically, you've got emails coming into operations inbox, dispatch inbox. And is there any other inbox that you have today? Forget about the individual inboxes, right? I'm going to be giving you a solution to manage these individuals.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  So the way we're set up is we're a brokerage, plus we're a company. We got our own company drivers. Okay? So those four people are really split two and two, two for the company, and then two for the logistics side. For the most part. One of those guys is managing all of it. So we've got a logistics mailbox, and then we've got an operations mailbox essentially to kind of split them out. Now, they do cover for each other. So that's where it gets into, they… need visibility, but not all the time, which is.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. Yep. Okay. Give me one minute.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  In the past, we didn't but now that we're as small as we are, we have to have backups because otherwise somebody's out… okay, there's no team anymore like there used to be.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. And given that if you happen to find a solution, any timelines you're looking at sir?

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Say that again?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  If you're looking at a solution and if it does tick all the boxes, are you looking at a timeline to implement something like this or is that a project for?

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  No, it's something I'm working on now that they want. I just told them, I don't have a solution right now. So let me see what's out there because there's nothing I can do within 365 that I know of that's going to handle everything they want unless we completely get rid of all the aliases and start over with just like two main mailboxes and that's it well, if that's the case that's the case, I've just got to come up with some kind of plan.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. No worries. Thank you for giving me the update here. Let me share my screen and quickly walk you through the platform and take all the questions towards the end of it. I will share my screen. Give me one quick minute, sir.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, do you see my inbox here? I'm logged into my Gmail account. This is my test account.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Yes, I do. And so again, does this work with 365 also? Or is this just a Gmail?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. I am extremely sorry, sir. I should have asked you about this. I missed to ask if this is on Gmail or on outlook, but yeah, we have got a solution for outlook. Also, I am actually logging into my test account on outlook. Give me one minute sir?

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Yeah. I noticed it looked like you guys specialized in the G suite, but we're on 365.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, we do have outlook as well. I am actually logging in right here.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  So, where are you located? I know the times were early in the morning for me, so you must be on the other side of the world.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I am located in India. I mean, I'm sitting at my place of interest. I stay with my parents, but yeah, we have got headquarters in the bay area. My CEO and the CTO sits in the us, even my sales officer, he does sit in the us as well. So, we have got a team which is remote at this point in time.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, if you notice I'm logged into app hybrid. This is a web interface. I'm logging in using my existing outlook credentials. These are the test accounts logins from my outlook. Now, once I log in into hiver, I keep myself online to work on the tickets and for the users who are away for weeks or weekends, they can just keep themselves offline for the tickets not to work on it. Now, let me go ahead and keep myself online for this demo. The very first thing that you notice here on the top under conversation is the personal inbox. Now, again, Steve, this is, very subjective. Few customers do like to have personal inbox integrated here because they don't switch back and forth from the personal outlook. They would want to make sure that their personal emails are coming in right here and they're managing these emails the way you're doing it in outlook today, at the same time, you notice that I also have access to these multiple shared inboxes. Now, this could be exactly the same inboxes that you have in your outlook three six five. The operations at the rate email address will be used and we'll create an inbox and add four users to this inbox, which is operations for you. And then it's going to be your support or whatever. That second inbox is info support or logistics. Now, all in all, what we are doing is logging into email with outlook credential and managing personal email in the top inbox and the operation emails, and the other mailbox emails. Right? From the same support section, you will have the brand new requests coming into the unassigned view here. So you would get an option to simply open the request, understand what it is about. And when you assign a specific conversation to a user in your team. Now, by the way, you can manually do that by looking at what the email is about, you open the hybrid activity panel. And then you change the ownership or in case this is not manual, you want to have system which automatically allocates these requests. Then you turn on certain automations at the back end and say, as long as emails come in from xyz supplier, it talks about let's say refund or cancellation, you've got assignments which are automatically done as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Are you with me? Yes, sir. Okay. Now on the top here, if you notice this email is not assigned to anybody, brand new request. I open the email, look at it. This looks like a new customer escalation, automatically tagged by hiver. The first response is already overdue because we have certain slas running. If you don't require it. Absolutely. We can turn that off, opening the email. Looking at the context. This assigning says none. I can go ahead and say, let me just pick this up. So it does not require Steve onto the system every time because as and when anybody looking at the support inbox or operations inbox, they have got visibility on how many requests are pending which are unattended. I would say, yep, I assign this to myself. I become the owner. It becomes part of mine section. Now, I would always log in into hiver, look at the ones which are assigned to me, start working on the tickets and look at what these customer requests are about. If there is an email priority. Let's say this is a low email. What is the shipping status? It's shipped already? What is the type of email? One two three. All of this is more like a customized fields. You could use it to your use cases to definitely organize the emails better. And when I need to talk to my colleagues, I would just add mentions, hey, Cole. Can you help me with this one for your information? Without forwarding these emails to my colleagues? I would rather just add mention and talk to my colleagues, drop them the notes and comments and they can definitely reply back to me right here. This is basically I'm having an internal collaboration and context to this customer query. Now, replying to an email is super simple. The way you currently do that. On outlook, it is exactly the same you choose to reply from either your personal email address for the agents or we would recommend that these emails should always go out from your, at mention, you know, the same common inbox email address, which is dispatcher at the rate or logistics or support, whatever the common inbox is. Then we've got email templates for all the repetitive nature of queries. We have got templates here so that you could use the standardized responses in case you're also interested to understand how happy your customers are with the level of support you're doing. You could always look at the customer satisfaction. I think I've not turned it on. Oh, yeah. So this is how it would look like. This is a proper customer support model where you're tracking the customer sentiments. If you don't require it, we can always disable it at the backend. And anytime I have been into a conversation which is complicated for an example, I want to look at how many team members are working on what sort of requests. So I go to the team section, I look at 10 requests opened up and I notice Rakesh is working on these many emails and I have got Cole who is offline today, but he has got two requests opened up. So I get an option to open the request, look at what the email is about, and summarize the conversation with one click. This will not only help me understand what must have happened so far. I think this is my internet, but yeah, it could actually help me summarize the conversation quickly. Looking at all the email chains here. And then I can just say, let me assign this to myself, work on this email and reply to this customer. This meaning, I have the complete visibility on team inbox, how many total open requests are there for my colleagues? So these all are the agents who have been assigned this email to now, like you said, you have got two folks looking at logistics inbox versus two on operations inbox. All four folks can actually be crossing over on these inboxes as and when it's needed. And they can literally look at these requests, put into the mind section, start to work on those requests as well. Once I'm done with the request, I am resolving the query. Let's say I'm replying to this and say this is a test reply. And I'm going to go ahead, send this email, close the ticket. This meaning, I am done with the resolution. All the closed emails will actually move into the closed bucket for us. We are not losing any context, but these are actually moving into the closed bucket. If there is a new reply from your supplier on the same email or your customer replies back, it again comes into the mind section for that representative because at the end of the day, he has been the owner of the ticket. Okay? And anything that you deliberately choose to put in pending because we want to work on this later for an example. Hey, this is a booking for the month of December and we want to find out if these number of containers are going to be going into this booking, I could choose to put that in pending because I'm not resolving this request immediately. I could choose to say the issue is about booking in December. So I could just maybe go ahead and keep all of that note for us. And the pending requests could be actually flagged inside the pending section. So I would go into the pending section bucket here. And I would see what these emails are all about something to do with. Invoice. This customer is asking for refund. This is an escalation, anything which is on hold request. We are not solving it immediately. You can always go ahead and look into the pending section. And it will also tell you the response owner of these tickets. So basically, the idea is that everybody log into hiver with their outlook credentials, manage their personal emails on the top inbox. If they don't want to do it, we can always disconnect it and manage logistics inbox and operations inbox from within one screen. And should there be a need to move emails across the departments, for an example, let's say this email, we are done with the operations inbox. This is something that has to go to logistics. I could simply go ahead and remove this email from this mailbox, and then I get an option to add this back into the mailbox, which is our support or logistics. This all is happening without forwarding emails by the way. And you will have a timeline who did all of that. If there is a response from the customer, if there is a delay response, all of that is possible from within one screen here. I want to take a quick pause and understand, is this aligned with what your needs are today?

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  I mean, I think it could be we're going to have to rethink what we're doing completely. I think, I mean this makes sense. You know, looking from my side, it, I mean this is pretty much how I manage my tickets, you know, internally. So it's just kind of a change in thought of how they handle their business back there. But that's what's needed because with the amount, I mean we're talking thousands of emails a day, you know, we're getting great requests and load requests and, you know?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, if these are thousands of emails.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  I would just completely, it's just not manageable right now. The way we're doing it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. In case we're looking at huge volume, like you said, I would go ahead at the back end and turn on the auto assignment. This meaning hiver will literally allocate these emails to all the agents available. Automatically. You don't have to manually assign emails and look at these assignments. Secondly, if you have a very specific workflows in mind, for an example, you want to create certain workflows wherein emails do come from a very specific vendor called Uber, just taking an example, you want to assign it all such emails to call. Or if these do talk about something in specific subject or the body of the letter of the email does contain anything to do with test or whatever. You could choose to assign it to a representative and tag those emails that, hey, this is an important or urgent ticket. So all of that is possible. These are very specific workflows that you are not manually assigning reassigning tags or assignments. And irrespective of that, when you turn on the auto assignment, anything remainder would still be allocated to people in the fair distribution workload. So all four users will get their sort of tickets every day when they log in. And we are no more looking into just the unassigned folder because hiver will take care of the round Robin of emails for you guys.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  So essentially, I guess that would eliminate all of my customer aliases that we used to use for that purpose. Send it to one mailbox, ops or logistics, and then use your internal rules to say, well, if it's from Nissan, go to tag one specific person, but everybody still has access to that ops box to work over top, somebody if they need to.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'll tell you one thing which is absolutely amazing here to your use case. You don't have to change anything with respect to aliases. When any email is sent to any of those aliases, you could declare all of those here in hiver. Irrespective of these emails are sent to info at the rate email, but you have declared this as an alias, it would actually land into your logistics inbox in hiver. So you could choose to declare the aliases here. Don't have to change anything at the backend for you. It'll be rather an easy management that everything would actually come into your main inbox for the team.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay. And then when they send back out, they could choose to send back out from that alias or from their.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely, like I showed you when I'm actually replying to these tickets, I get an option to send either from my email address or the alias email address. So yes, for now, if I were to reply to this one because I have been a part of this inbox, so it says this email address or my personal. So as long as I also have an access to that alias email address, I could choose to reply from there as well.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay. So let's say they're at home, they're on their cell phone, they get an email and they're actually using regular outlook. I mean, what are they?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  They even have a mobile application. So your team members are going to be downloading a hiver mobile application for outlook that's an independent application, whatever that you see here, management of emails with respect to your operations, adding tagging, emails, replying to those emails, all of that is pretty much possible with the mobile application.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay. So when they send an email out of what is it hive or hiver? What do you call it? So when they send an email out of there, do they see that from their sent folder in outlook or no? I know they're not, I'd say they're in outlook, but if I'm in their outlook mailbox by chance, would I be seeing their outbound email out of outlook or is it just going out through hiver?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I would have to quickly cross check. I believe it's a two way thing because all the data still remains on your outlook servers. So when I'm working on any of those emails from within hiver, there needs to be a sent item in outlook, but do you mind if I quickly cross check and maybe write back to you on an email? Something that I'm not, very sure and I do want to make sure that I reconfirm and then give you an update.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  I'm just thinking, you know, admin wise for me. I mean, I necessarily probably wouldn't be using this maybe once we see how it works, but I'm just wondering for me admin wise. And if my boss says, hey, what's josh been doing? Or did he send something to them? You know, right now I can get into a 365 outlook box and tell them what's going on. I'm just wondering what visibility I would have to their accounts within hiver?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I mean, boss can be added as a user in hiver and they can look at the ones which are closed ticket and obviously the ones which are done. And from the reporting analytics, he would be, very amazed to look at what your team is up to. So in the analytics section for your operations inbox, you could see the total number of conversations happening which are active. New resolved, you could select the date range. Let's say I'm looking at last 90 days and under user report, it would tell you out of all these users which are emails assigned versus sent. And if you want to find out what Rakesh has been up to so far, you would be able to see the entire report.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  All right. So let's go back to you. Said you could log in and log out kind of like you would a call queue, I guess. So let's say Becky goes home. She logs out. She's getting tagged for all Nissan things. So she's tagged as her automatically, but she's not there. So now what email just sits in the ops box for somebody else to pick up?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That is right. Two ways to look at it. One, I'm actually working on the tickets and there is a response which has come in after I logged out, which is possible because I work until nine P. M customer chooses to reply at one a. M for an example. And when I'm offline, I won't get that response added to me because I made sure that the emails are not going to be assigned to me back when I'm actually out of office. Secondly, even if these emails are assigned to me, any request which is under unassigned mine or team. These all are the requests which are not pending or closed. These are open by default that we need to work on. So I can go ahead and look at the team section. By default. I know the cash logs out at nine. And if there is any email that needs attention, any of my colleagues can look into my inbox, look at the email status. Can I, can they just simply go ahead and assign it to themselves. Yes, I can say Cole can assign it to themselves. And then from the mine section of Cole, he could actually revert to that email. So at any point in time, Steve, the idea is to not miss an email but you cannot control when the response comes from your customer irrespective of whether or not you're online or offline, but the new response, new emails are not going to be assigned to you via auto assignment. If I'm offline.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay. And that chat that you're doing there, that's the internal hiver chat, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's the chat on the website for your clients. If somebody wants to chat with you or they want to just go onto your website, this is exactly the same users who could even manage the live chat from your website. So, this is basically like if I go to help hiver, this is a knowledge base that we offer to self help our customers for the repetitive image of queries, and if they do not find answers to themselves, they can start a chat. And this is exactly the same chat that lands inside this one interface here.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  So, we can program that into our website to use the chat functionality.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. It's a zero code chat? Yes, absolutely, sir.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  That would be really helpful for our recruiters. They've been asking for that for quite a while. Drivers don't like to talk on the phone these days, they would rather chat. We don't have that functionality, so, if we turn on chat, how… does that get managed? How does it know if it's a sales call or a sales chat or a support chat or?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, when you actually set up the chat inbox, you get an option to do all of these settings. By the way, I mean, you could ask whether you are trying to look at. Okay. So you have a pre chat form. So you can ask your customer what the intent is? What are the questions? Ask for their email phone? You could even configure bot, which will be more like, hey, you want to ask us maybe five typical questions. If you find an answer to, yes. No, maybe you want to talk to sales or you want to talk to operations. And this is how you could actually go ahead and do all of that pre chat form. I would say. So this is where you could, you know, ask for the message, who do you want to talk to support or sales? And that's when your users will actually prompt the information, and this would route the chat to the representative in your team, whoever is available. And these are exactly going to be the same folks who are managing your support inbox or logistics or operations. They would pretty much be managing the sales inbox. Also, I mean, the chat inbox, I would call it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So all in all, you're looking at a solution to manage your customer communication, whether these are coming into your inbox, which is our shared emails or these are been prompt on your website through chats.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay. And then I guess pricing wise, what are we looking at? Is that per user or?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's per user and we're looking at a very basic pricing because your use case is not that difficult. It's a simple straightforward use case. I would say if you're looking at chatbots, we are looking at this plan which is 45 dollars per login. So for five users, I mean, we do buckets of five. So even if you have a team of four, I would say we'll add one of your boss to look at the analytics. And then this is going to be 45 by five on annual basis. So that's the entire subscription looking at, there is no set up or no training or no no cost to onboard that will be like within the same package we're looking at. And this can go do multiple inboxes for you, like up to five shared inboxes. This can do chat for you. This can also have multiple aliases that you can declare in hiver. We'll do the complete analytics and reporting and dashboard, for your team and the owner of the company. And yeah.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  So five five max shared mailboxes. And so the difference between pro and growth is basically a chatbot.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And in growth, you have limited reporting, you don't have chatbot here, but you still have basic chat. By the way. I mean somebody wants to try and talk to your team that could get routed to an agent available. That's still possible in growth by the way. But the chatbot wherein you could configure certain answers to the questions. Hey, I want to talk to support. Now, the bot asks what sort of support you require. You require support with regards to pickup or scheduling a drop or whatever. So that is chatbot configuration.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Are you looking at any specific budget? Sir? I'm open to discuss that.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  No, this is obviously not something we've done in the past. So this is on top of what I'm already spending. But at this point, with the amount of people we've lost, we have to get more something… better. I mean, the workflow right now is just not sustainable. So it's kind of a necessity to be honest.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Yeah. I mean, if that happens, well, I completely understand the current situation. What I can be totally up to doing to support your business at this point in time is maybe if you're looking at this subscription, we require advanced workflows and everything because we require a lot of scalability and operational efficiencies without having to have a lot of users doing all of that. And you need a scalable solution. What I can think of doing is maybe offer this plan not at 25 but say around 30 dollars where you would still enjoy, you know, 30 35 percent discount. So I could do this one at the cost of 30 30 dollars all in all. So I can try and do that for you for five logins. So we are looking at the.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Yeah. Go ahead. Is there any kind of… trial or use case that I can just so I can show what we can actually do?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  You know, it's one of these things that's going to have to be hand on and I'm going to have to figure out how we're going to restructure everything because this is all going to change if we go with this way, but it's hard to do without having my hands on it, you know?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I can help you set up your trial, invite a couple of folks. You test it for a couple of days. The question is when would you want to do that?

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay. Let's let's hold off a minute. Let me do some more research. I assume there's YouTube videos and things like that. That I can kind of look and see… and you said flexport and then arrive are two that you've worked with?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That is right. Let me also share a couple of more testimonies. Okay. Give me a second. These are two which are, yeah, which are right there on top of my mind because I personally onboarded them but yeah.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  We work with both of them too.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we have got direct expedite, we have got arrive logistics. We have got CFR rankings. We have got clutter, we have got rush order, its logistics flexport, actually, we have got a handful of logistics players.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Let me do a little bit of research. I think it's something that could definitely help when we're going to have to figure out how to set it up and all that. But… yeah, I think it's definitely something that could help. Sure. So if you can give me just a little bit of time if you don't mind emailing me that pricing just so I have it in writing and I can share it with my CEO, kind of go over what the functionality is. And then if he thinks it's something that might be of interest, I'll definitely get with you and see if we can do a quick, you know, quick little setup with just a couple of us so I can show what we can do. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. I can share a couple of use cases from the same industry that we have been solving these problems for. And then maybe if we could reconnect on Thursday around the same time, if that's okay for a quick feedback meeting?

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Yes. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me quickly check my calendar.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Or are we open to connect maybe 15 minutes earlier than today's? Time, if that's okay with you? Yeah, sure. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'll call it hiver feedback sync and I'm going to be inviting you. Should there be a need to invite your CEO once you initiate a conversation internally? I'm going to be helping you with the reference material that you can look at. I know they're super busy people. Yeah.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  He'll be hands off for sure. Maybe the logistics director. I mean, he's the one that's kind of trying to get me to figure out a way to set this up. So he'd probably be involved. So the director of logistics, he's over operations.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And logistics? Okay. All right. I'll be sending all of the information on an email. I've already sent you an invite for our Thursday catch up. Should be right there in your inbox.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay. Yep. Got it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And if you come across any more questions, please feel free to write back to me. I'm just an email away from you. And otherwise we are scheduled to again talk on Thursday with respect to pricing. Like I said, Steve, I'm open to discuss what the budgets are.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. I want to make sure that this works well for you. And then, you know, we kind of look at whatever makes it literally work for you because I understand the situation hasn't been exactly what it was before earlier because I've got a lot of friends working in this industry. I hail from India in punjab especially we've got a lot of people in the US who opt as a trucking jobs and all of that. So I agree. And I understand the current state.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Yeah. And if we can get it at a better price, I mean, it's something that, I could see where I could roll it out to the whole company. I mean, we're not talking about a lot of people, but, you know, I mean it could definitely help our admin department and recruiting as well. So, you know, budget wise.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah. We can always discuss that. I mean once it does tick all the boxes and it looks like a good solution, we can always figure out what the best pricing is. I mean, it's not to do with just the subscription. I would say since we work with a lot of logistics. This is going to be another success for your team as well. Yeah.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Okay. Well, I appreciate it. We'll be in touch. Thanks so much. Thank you so.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very much. We'll talk again on Thursday. So thank you so much for your time again. Bye.

Stevie Embree (stevie.embree@shipsts.com):
  Bye. Appreciate it. Bye.
