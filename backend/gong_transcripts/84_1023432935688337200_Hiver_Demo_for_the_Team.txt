================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, bill. Good morning.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Hey, guys.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hey, nice to meet you again. How are you doing?

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Good. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good. Thank you so much for joining in.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Sure. We should have a few more people. Did you see them on the invite? Did they accept?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I do not see them on the invite, but I do know that there were a couple of people who wanted to join today. So, yeah.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Okay. Let me just double check to see. I hate like how, you know, when I forward invites from other people, I can't see, you know, whether they accept it or not. So sorry about that. Let's see here. Sure, hopefully I accept it.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Yes, I should have sent it on.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  The fourth last week. Okay. Let me just make sure that they're oh, yeah. Looks like they're joining.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Why is it?

WILLIAR:
  Hello?

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Let me know when you go.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me know whenever we are all good to start. If you are waiting for more folks, happy to wait.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Okay. I think, oh… there we go.

WILLIAR:
  Does that mean… we?

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Can kind of hear you, but you're cutting out, can you try it again?

WILLIAR:
  We keep getting.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  There's some audio, but it's cutting a little bit.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I feel it's a delay actually, I mean, it is working but it's not working appropriately.

WILLIAR:
  We'll back out.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Okay.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Have a good day. We can see you, but we can't hear you yet.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

WILLIAR:
  Okay. Yeah… yelling at a singer though.

WILLIAR:
  Yeah.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Rakesh, we have zoom. Sorry, we have teams rooms. So zoom does work, but it's not the first technology that works in the conference rooms. So sometimes there's a little bit of a hiccup. It usually works. Okay. And then,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  no worries. I mean, if we need, we can always connect on Google hangouts. That also is okay. I think that's worse. Yeah. Is that?

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Yeah, that's worse. Zoom will be okay. Just let them join again. It usually does work as long as they forward the invite to the room, which it looks like they did. They were able to join and we were able to see them so maybe it's just the plug is not seated properly or something. I don't know. Let's see when they rejoin.

WILLIAR:
  Okay. Can you hear us better now?

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  We can hear you now.

WILLIAR:
  Yeah. Okay. All right. Might not be able to see us, but you can hear us. So that's good.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  That's good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm glad, thank you so much for joining in. Bill and I met last week but this is the very first time I'm catching up.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Rakesh and I take care of sales at hiver. I've been with the company for over four years, personally onboarded more than 500 teams a lot from logistics and supply chain. So we'll be taking you through what hiver has to offer on basis of what I spoke with bill last time around. And obviously, I mean, you can always let me know if this is good in understanding that you're looking for a customer service tool to manage all two to 500 emails every day within a team of eight, 10 people at this point in time. As per the current understanding, the workflow is so manual that we are all copied in these emails individually. We forward emails to each other and it's not just a scalable problem but also it's not an efficient workflow where we don't know if people are working on emails on time, if these are delayed in response, if we are double responding to these customers, and perhaps the top management notice that hey, there has to be a better way to work on these emails, then spending a lot of time on operational inefficiencies. We would want team to literally use their brain and the time to work on these emails then to sort these emails and juggle… around with so many inefficiencies. So that is what we discussed last time around. Think about hiver as a ticketing solution but not a proper traditional ticketing where you are having to have a heavy implementation. There is a huge learning curve. So it's more like a very easy to use conversation platform which is very much like outlook interface, easy to go simple, very, you know, user friendly. And that's what the idea was to give you guys a quick walkthrough on the platform. Any questions to begin with?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you guys have any doubts? And I would want to make sure that I implement the training like today's demo and I make sure that I address all of these questions for you. So that's the idea that's the crux to just to give you guys a quick overview of, you know, rundown on what we discussed in the previous meeting with bill?

WILLIAR:
  Okay. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. Apart from me, I've got Manoj with me. He hails from the technical implementation team. Should we come across any technical queries, we have got a resource available, we could always look into the data, the setup and anything where I fail to maybe answer any of those. But yeah, I mean, I just wanted to make sure that we have got the resource available should we get into that? Okay. All right. So what I'm going to do is share my screen, quickly take you through how hiver functions and take all the questions towards the end of the conversation. Feel free to interrupt me if these are important or make a note of them and we can answer all of those towards the end. Okay. Sounds good. Lovely. Now, I would want to get a heads up if you're okay to look at my screens. I mean, is this visible?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yes, yes, lovely. Now, if you notice I'm logged in into app hiver. This is a web interface. I'm using my outlook credentials. So this Rakesh login is exactly my test logins from outlook interface. So all the customer support people who would need to work on these emails would login into app hiver. Once we create an account for you guys and use their existing outlook logins to authenticate, just as a one time activity. That's pretty much it. Now, the very first thing that they would do is the moment I online login keep myself available to work on the emails. I would see the personal emails on the top. So this is where I could connect my personal inbox, which is any email sent to Rakesh at hiver. I should be able to go look into my personal inbox, look at these emails sent to me. I'm not sharing these emails with anybody. These are mine emails. I could look at it, work the way I would want it. Just the way you currently do that in outlook, pretty much exactly the same at the same time. If you notice I'm also part of these multiple shared inboxes. So these are going to be essentially the team inboxes for you guys. Now, I remember we talked about something like support, which is a customer support inbox. So as long as you receive emails from your different vendors, your suppliers, your other, you know, service providers, your clients directly. If they have queries, they are going to be sending emails to support at your logisticscompany. Com or you could have another email, which could be something like logistics at the rate? Like whatever that common inbox email address is, we would receive all the new emails right inside the unassigned folder. Now, this would be a view, it would be an email view where you would have all the unattended requests, anything which is brand new. Nobody looked at it. We haven't worked on it. All of those would actually land into the unassigned folder that's when we would have a number in front of it as a team, we are looking at these number of emails which are not dealt yet. As of yet. Now, once I assign reassign emails and put the ownership on the ticket, it becomes part of mine. For an example, let me see if I could look at any email and just move into… this mailbox. I'll just add it to support inbox, so that I could show you a quick example what I'm referring to. Okay, for an example, customer sent us a new email which is right there in our unassigned folder. You have a quick email which is one, nobody looked at it. I open the email as a team member. I would open this activity panel from here. If you notice this is going to be the ownership, if I assign it to myself, this becomes part of mine section here on the top. The status here is open, which means that I am still working on the ticket. This needs to be actioned upon. These tags basically are going to be the actual information on what this email is about. Is this a billing email? Is this something to do with the finance loading? Maybe something to do with the quotation? This is basically the actual category of emails and you can define the categories as, and when anybody work at it, hiver can automatically even look at the context of the email and add a tag saying, hey, this looks like an escalation. So I can go ahead and use a tag called escalation. Now, once I assign this email to myself, it becomes part of mine in the mind section. I would be able to see that email. And apart from that, when I want to talk to my colleagues, for an example, I am the owner email is in open status. This is an escalation. And I want to work on this email at the same time. When I want to talk to my colleague Manoj and I would want to tell him that, hey, Manoj. Can you help me with that? What you would notice is I can at mention my colleague right from here and I would say, hey, Manoj. Can you help me with this ticket now? Basically, I'm actually coordinating internally without forwarding emails manually to my colleagues or replying to a customer while I'm keeping my other colleagues in CC, which we do not need to do in hiver. So with hiver, you have a clear visibility on. How many emails are there, who is working on it? What is the email about? When you want to talk to your colleagues? You can at mention drop them the notes, comments as such. And when you need to work on the tickets, you can just simply reply using the email templates and you've got an idea on the repetitive nature of queries. Let's say I'm doing a test reply. You could go ahead, send this email to the customer and close it when you're done with the response. So all the closed emails will then move to the closed bucket for your team. And everybody has access to all these closed requests like the ones which are done. These are resolved. If there is another response on top of this, it would again open up in the mind section. And that's where I will have a complete loop where we have new requests in unassigned emails. Mine are the ones which I'm dealing with. And the best part is when you want to know how many total requests are there, which are open for the entire team? I go to the team section and it says there are 10 emails these different representatives are already working on. So this Guy is working on one open ticket. Rakesh has got two. Matt doesn't have any. Max is working on one. If max takes a day off today, you have an option to simply pull these emails and say, hey, Rakesh, can you deal with it? And now, at the same time mind section will actually drop up and it would say these are the three emails Rakesh has to work on. So immediately that's how the numbers would change and you have a complete transparency on all of that. Any questions on the basic interface before I move forward?

WILLIAR:
  So when you're assigning it to people that will manually have to be done, there's no way to have anything where it's if something were specifically tagged, you could then assign it to someone based on that tag.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good question. Yeah. Now, I showed you the way how you could manually assign it, but certainly we can look at the automation workflows. And this could be something like when you tell me inside the support inbox for your customers, you want to turn on the automations workflow. And you would say, hey, as long as the email talks about something in the subject line that talks about say, you know, maybe it's a loading request or it's an urgent request or it's a refund request. So you could just not only look at the subject but even the body of the emails or if these emails do come from a very specific vendor that we work with, maybe, you know, abc logistics, just taking a quick example here, you get an option to assign email to a specific representative automatically and add a tag also that these emails are urgent. So you could choose to do all of that by the way. So the ones.

WILLIAR:
  if we're not doing the automated ones, anyone can grab it and assign it to themselves, or is it just certain key people that have access to assign?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Everybody has access because it's a transparent system. And even on top of it, if you don't want people to look at those emails and manually assign each other, we have got auto assignments since we're dealing with huge number of emails, I would say we turn on this one. Hiver automatically routes the first email to the first email online, second to the second. Because I'm assuming everybody's pretty much trained on dealing with everything. So we can go ahead and turn on the route. Drop in. Hiver will automatically assign emails and people will be just limited to looking at their mind section, start to work on those emails, knock them off. And should there be still any email which is out of my purview and I need to reassign it to somebody else. I can go ahead and manually just change the ownership and make them the owner of the ticket. Okay? Did I answer the question in terms of the automations workflow and round drop in for auto assignments?

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Yes, and just to follow up on that, Rakesh, if I go into the shared thing and I reply to one of the shared emails, will it automatically assign it to me?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if I open, if I pick any of those emails and I intentionally, I don't even pick up the ownership. If I just simply reply, we can make sure at the back end, it becomes your ticket. So you be the owner once you reply to it.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Gotcha. Okay. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Apart from that, in terms of the tags here, which is basically different folders that you use in outlook today, where you classify different emails, different categories and everything. Imagine if there's an urgent ticket. And bill wants to understand how many total urgent tickets do we have as a team? One or the other way would be that he's talking to everybody in the team, trying figuring it out manually, which all are the urgent requests that require our immediate attention? Or with hiver, you'll just simply go ahead, pull a tag called urgent and it will tell you this ticket in question which is assigned to Rakesh is urgent because it's been escalated and the resolution is already overdue. We haven't been able to respond to this email yet. Can we look at this one? Yes. Can we understand what's happening here? These stages are? Okay. What's the shipping status? This looks like it's shipped already. What is the type of the email? Maybe one, two three. However we want to classify these custom fields if this is absolutely urgent. And imagine if this email has multiple back and forth and it's a complicated email. All you can do with hiver is to simply go ahead and summarize the conversation. Meaning hiver will look at those email context, give you a quick summary of what must have happened so far. So when I just quickly summarize the conversation… Manoj, let me check that. I mean, it's really weird. Manoj. Do you know what the error is about? This said? It could not generate the summary?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Just give me a second, I'm checking.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And you might want to take the note as well. It's really weird. I mean, apologies guys. It doesn't really happen very often. But as in when you're on a customer call and you're afraid of not to get into it. It just ditches you at the same moment. So basically what it does is it actually generates the summary, literally tell you in a couple of sentences as to what the entire context is about. Like Tony contacted us with regards to xyz, then we actually.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Rakesh. Yeah. Can you just go back and try on a different email?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Let's just quickly look at it. Let's say now under the tags, I want to find out the email about refund. I look at any of those emails, open this one up and I summarize the conversation to understand what is the exact context? Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Well, that's weird.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  I think it's just with this particular shared mailbox, because the AI summarizer is working for me in the other mailboxes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Which one are you referring to? I can probably take that one as well. I mean, are you okay to look at the sales and success?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So you have the finance mailbox, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Guys, let's say this is our support inbox, looking at one conversation which has not been assigned to anybody, has a couple of emails to it. When I summarize this conversation, it actually gives me a quick idea on what the email is about. So when I summarize it, so basically it tells you that somebody contacting us, this was about the sales department. So basically, it's a crux of every complex email that you can maybe summarize it in a couple of sentences, save this as a note. And then you could choose to say who needs to work on this one. And it works exactly the same way you want to find out how many emails are with respect to the billing requests. So I can go ahead and use a tag called billing and that's how you could simply sort your emails, work on these emails. Mine are the ones where I need to work on it. And towards the end of the day, I want to make sure that these emails are done in time. I close all of those. And when I close it, the rest of the team also works on all the emails. These are closed. Essentially in the team section, we don't have. Then any of those emails open for the rest of the day. And then we are good to go log it out. And as and when there are new responses, it again comes into the mind section because at the end of the day, I'm still the owner of the ticket and that's how you would make sure there is a complete transparency collaboration between everybody in the team and you have the entire visibility on who's working on. What… does that make sense? Am I confusing you, do you've got more questions?

WILLIAR:
  Nothing on that section? Yeah, following so far? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, apart from that, you get all the notifications here in the bell section here, whether these are new emails coming in, somebody at mentioning you tagging you, you're getting any sort of escalations, bill is asking you to look at this email. And he had mentions you. So the notifications are right there in the bell icon. Then is the templates here. So this is where you could have all of your email templates, any nature of query which is repetitive. You want to write on all these answers. You don't have to type in so much again and again. So you can create these templates, share it with the team, either keep it private to yourself. And when you're replying to an email, you could choose these templates by the way, from the analytics standpoint, this is more like reporting where I want to understand what my team is doing from support standpoint. When I go ahead and look at what's happening in the last 30 days, I could see the reports on workload, how many of them are active emails versus new versus resolved? And all in all, if you look at these emails with regards to the first response time, I could see this is my first response time, assigned time. This is how long we take to resolve these emails, the resolution and first response. So, so basically, these are the performance report that you can see for your team as a whole, one step ahead, dig deeper into it. And you would see the user report on how many emails are assigned versus emails sent out of these individual users in boxes. What Rakesh is up to? What is he working on for last 30 days? Something is literally wrong. 352 hours for first response, average time, is definitely not acceptable, right? And I can figure out what these emails are about. I mean I can see this email in particularly came at this point in time, worked upon on eight like 16. And then we want to know what this is about. You could just click and actually trouts you to the same conversation in question. So that's how I could get to see of everything now, reports on tags, different category of emails, how long we take to work on these category of emails? All of that is pretty much possible. And again, something which is absolutely important is the reporting on SLA, are we working on time, the response time resolutions time, how many of them are actually violated? And if you want to find out what these emails are, that have been violated, you go into the analyze report and it'll tell you these are the four report emails that we could not work on time. And at the end of the day, I'm not sure if this is important, but this is more like customer satisfaction. This definitely assist a lot of our customers when they are directly dealing in an E commerce business. Like I ordered something from Amazon, I got it delivered because it got missed or whatever. But this is more like you're actually capturing customer sentiments. So you can even run reports on it. How many of them are happy? Sad neutral, the feedback and everything on, right? On one screen here. Okay. Any… any questions by far?

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  No, you… no.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any, anything from you, bill, did I cover anything which is missed for now or do you have any more questions around it, you?

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Briefly touched on it, but can you show us, the automated responses, both the canned responses, that we've set up as well as the AI responses?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Now, let's say I'm into the support inbox. These are the three emails I'm working on. Let me pick the one where the resolution is overdue. This is the delayed response email. So I open the email up, look at what the context about this email is. And when I'm replying, I get an option to reply using the email template for an example, this is a refund email. So I can go ahead and search for an email template called refund. Now, apparently, I don't have it, but let's say, this is perhaps a refund email, right? So I would say, hey, Rakesh, we're looking at your request or whatever it is. And then the AI compose can actually help me fix the grammar, make it more professional without you doing anything extra or cut copy pasting, I can just do it right? From here, number two. On basis of the knowledge sources, for an example, you guys have frequently asked questions somewhere posted on your website or you've got knowledge base or knowledge sources. But when you receive email inquiries with regards to, hey, what your cancellation policies are? Or do you want to tell me how much would this cost? If I want to just, you know, book you for xyz service. Now, hiver can help you draft a reply. And that draft would certainly be hosted on. I mean, would be on basis of the actual knowledge that we host on the knowledge sources. For an example, when I go into the hiver AI, it would help me compose the email, summarize the email. And if you see this knowledge sources, I could get to upload the documents and make sure hiver looks at that repository of information for you and helps your agents literally draft those responses. Saves a lot of time. You could even enable the hiver knowledge base, which will be something like if I take it to help hiver, this is like a 24 seven buddy that you could keep on your website or maybe, you know, share the link with your customers as well that, hey, in case you want to know anything with regards to billing and payments, go into the billing and payments, look at all of that information that you can host on hiver itself. And should they, there be more questions instead, they can write an email to support at the rate they can start a chat, you can even turn on the bot that can answer your questions, behalf of your client and your agents. In case they still do have more questions, then you can ask them to, hey, submit a question or query, and that's when you could still see all of those conversations in the chat option. Now, this is a sales chat for my demo account, but you can always call it your, you know, a chat bot or your chat. So you could see all of that conversation wherein the actual repetitive nature of queries can be still dealt with from within the hiver AI on basis of the knowledge sources through copilot here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any doubts? Any questions? So.

WILLIAR:
  I do have a question about something you had mentioned a little earlier. You said that there was a personal email feature in this as well. Do you have, are you able to use some of the same things that were from, that are applied in the share inbox in your personal? Like maybe the tags or things like that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. For the personal emails, you do have tags options, but these tags are different because these are your personal tags. Anyways. When I look at the personal emails, let me take you through a quick example. For any example, my CEO contacts me stating here with cash. You have done really good last month. This is the appreciation for you now that's very personal email to myself. And I'm not going to be sharing it with anybody, but I can use the tag stating this is an appreciation for me. However, it has got nothing to do with sharing this email, but I can still for my reference tag those emails. So these personal emails can still be used. You could work on these emails. You could use these tags. And also when I'm actually looking into the personal inbox, let me pick an email which is okay. This one, let's say, so this is personal to myself. I still have an option to look at the notes. So even if I do want to add mention somebody, I can do that, but I'm actually looking at the personal inbox email, my only colleague who I'm tagging would be able to see the email. Otherwise, none other than myself and the person in question while replying, I would still have an option to use the templates and all the templates that we have created. I can see the personal templates or shared templates amongst everybody in the team. I can make sure I use those templates. So there are functionalities that I can still use the personal emails for such as summarize you've, got AI compose, you've got templates and yeah, you could still use it, but the idea is personal emails remain personal unless you want deliberately these emails to be shared within your support team. That was.

WILLIAR:
  My next question. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, if a customer absolutely likes you and this, they keep sending you emails personally, but you would always want them to be a part of support inbox. You get an option to simply drag and drop this email, add it with one go. You archive the email from your inbox and start to work on, right? From the shared inbox for the team. So, and.

WILLIAR:
  then, is this personal inbox also tied to, would that be our outlook inbox personally, that's exactly?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Your outlook inbox? Actually, we are wanting you not to log in into outlook back and forth. If you're working on the ticketing part of customer service, you could look at your personal inbox on the top. Okay. So in an ideal world, my customers never log in into outlook once they start to work on hiver, they would still go, you know, say probably now once while, they want to just look at these emails into their outlook, but that's not needed at all because they are pretty much looking at their personal emails as well as their customer emails from one screen.

WILLIAR:
  And how does this work on cell phones? Only a couple of us really check emails on our cell phones, but there will be more travel for the team in the future, we.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Have got a dedicated mobile application. Yeah, absolutely. You can download and however we, whatever we went through, looking at the mailboxes, the personal emails, looking at mind sections, you open the email, you tag people, you reply to those emails, everything is pretty much right there in the mobile application. Okay?

WILLIAR:
  All right. Excellent. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. Any more question, guys?

WILLIAR:
  I personally can't think of anything. Yeah. And I don't have anything else at the moment either? Yeah, great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Well, I'm open to have your feedback. What do you now think about it?

WILLIAR:
  Yeah. I mean, for a lot of it, there seems to be good options. I definitely like the sharing of the inboxes. We have something called, we have another inbox called tcsam payments where customers give us their wire transfer information and we're always having to add tcsam payments. Whereas if it seems like here, if I get that, I can just move that email to that inbox or?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes.

WILLIAR:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's right? And if that group inbox is dealing with a heavy volume, we can even help you make that as a shared inbox, invite the relevant team members. If you also need to work on those payment related emails, we can absolutely have that as one of those mailboxes because it's not limited to just a customer service. A lot of my customers from logistics, use it for other operations, customer support and finance and accounting as well. So you can choose to have multiple inboxes. And there can be crossover of folks like you don't care about what's happening in finance. Fair enough. You don't want to be a part of finance team, but let's say if bill wants to know what's happening in the operations inbox versus customer service, and then the finance, he can be part of all three inboxes and move across all of these emails to each other.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay? All right. Well, if there are no more questions, I think bill, you and I can discuss what the next steps would look like once you discuss it internally with your team. Would that be fair if we reconnect maybe a quick 10 minutes of a placeholder towards the end of this week? Or do you already know what the next steps would look like? I mean, I'm happy to set you up on trial, test this platform between your team members and then make a decision and, that would be the recommended step for a lot of my customers. But let me know sure.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Yeah, let us talk internally and then we'll have a chat at the end of the week and go from there?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure, or how about just 10 minutes, quick follow up, catch up on Friday. Sure. Of course, I don't require more than 10 minutes, just gonna be like a quick placeholder for you.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Sure. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. All right. And do we need to, I mean, should we need to add team members or if they have got more questions, you've got my email, feel free to write route them to me, or directly ask me these questions. You've got my calendar as well. Feel free to book another meeting. But we are anyways going to be talking on Friday. And yeah, I mean, let me know if there is any further assistance that you require. You already have all of the documents with regards to securities and everything. Should there be any more questions from your it team, your security, your compliance officers feel free to route them to me and I should be able to take care of them.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Sounds good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Any, anything else that I can be of help to you today guys?

WILLIAR:
  Just one more real quick one that I thought of how we assign the emails. The way our team works is we're responsible for certain areas, but sometimes requests come in for multiple areas in the same email. You, can you assign one email to multiple people? Or how does that work?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Now assigning emails to multiple people at one point in time may create confusions, because I will assume Rakesh is going to be working on it. Cash will assume Manoj is going to be doing it. What hybrid will allow you to do is once you are done with your part, you can show the draft, whoever is the actual owner of the ticket will implicate all of that, improvise the response and then send it across to the customers or you have got an option to add mention your colleagues, you do your part, reply to your customers at mention your colleagues internally and tell them that, hey, my colleague would be addressing this part of you, either you collaborate and draft, share the draft with each other, if that's okay. I can maybe share my screen and help you visualize that. Yeah.

WILLIAR:
  Sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So having to have multiple, you know… oops, actually, I shared the wrong window. So give me one minute.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right now, here, let's see if I'm working on any of those emails. And this needs some bit of attention from my colleague, Manoj about, let's say an escalation. So I would say, hey, Manoj, you take care of the escalation, please? All right. And with regards to the major query, I can go ahead, respond to the customer and I can either respond or I can just simply save a draft for an example. This is test response to first query… and then I can save a draft. Now, this will be saved and shared amongst with the teammates or whoever I just add mention so that my colleague then can actually address, the question about the escalation. And from the saved drafts, they would have an option to simply look at the drafts which are shared, with the team, so that's where we could see the drafts also. And.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  So, Manoj could go in and collaborate.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, make changes to it, improvise it. If he needs to be the owner, he could just change the ownership, be an owner and reply to the customer. Otherwise Manoj can still make further changes to it and say, rikash saved it for you. And then I can, you know, go ahead and work on top of it.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Okay, cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Any, any more questions, guys that's.

WILLIAR:
  it for now on our end? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely, bill. There is already an invite that I've sent to you for the same time just for 10 minutes. Do you wanna check that? Please? Sure?

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Great.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  I didn't come across yet, but it takes a little time, no.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Worries. All right. Look forward to talking to you again on Friday, and should there be anybody else from your team, feel free to invite them, happy to take all the questions. And we look forward to your feedback on Friday then.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
  Sounds good. Thank you. Just come through now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you so very much. Thank you team for your time, lovely, catching up with you and I look forward to talking to you again, sounds.

Bill Torregrossa (btorregrossa@trtn.com):
