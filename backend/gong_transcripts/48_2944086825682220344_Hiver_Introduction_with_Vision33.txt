Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  hi, Isabel. Hi, how.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Are you, I'm.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  doing quite well. How about yourself?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  I'm doing, good. Thank you. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I see that we reached out to you or a member of my business development team did?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yes, Cameron, I believe is his name.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yes. So, had you heard of hiver before Cameron reached out?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  I actually had, I think I got contacted by someone else a few months ago. So the name did ring a bell and I was able to look on LinkedIn to kind of see let's say what you guys offer. I saw that you guys are in California, pretty let's say big company. You guys seem to have pretty good growth as well. And I saw that there were some big names that were using your product too. So interested in learning more.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Yeah, that's a great place to start. And I see that your business, do you specialize in ERP implementations? Is that the right way to think about it?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yeah. So let's say with the sage intact. So with, for customers that are already let's say live within sage intact, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. So it's like customers are already on sage, and then you are like a managed like essentially you offer managed services to these companies for like, you know, it and management of sage?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yeah. So it can be let's say with different products depending on their needs. So, if we have partners with let's say other expertise that can be connected to the sage application and then just in general be their CSM. So help them, let's say for growth in general. Okay, great.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I studied accounting in college. So not that I'm from, I haven't been in sage myself, but I'm pretty familiar with an ERP.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yeah, I'd say they're quite similar. I was in Netsuite before and now with sage. So once you kind of understand, let's say the dynamics, it's usually quite straightforward.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yes. Well, let me share a little bit more intel. So I'm Alex, I'm one of the senior accounting executives over here at hiver. I've been in the help desk contact center as a service space for the last 11 years. So I know a fair amount, but there's always more to learn in terms of what hiver does. We are a B to B AI powered shared inbox solution. What that means is we are bringing together like email domains such as like, you know, support at or if you had a specific client that's like emailing, you know, their unique domain at your company for assistance or, you know, to collaborate, we bring that into a shared inbox and allow anyone that has access to this inbox to see it, have full assignment of who owns this kind of conversations with the notes, being able to draft up emails and have others review. So it's really a program to help with that like collaboration around emails that go to many people internally and you want to make sure that things aren't ever, you know, getting missed.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Missed. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And I'm assuming you all, do you all use Microsoft like our outlook for emails?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yeah, I'd say mainly, okay, not.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Gmail. Perfect. No… yeah, that makes sense. So, I'll show you a little bit about how this looks… and just out of curiosity with.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Gmail with everything like what, let's say what is supported?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we have two different products… one for Gmail, one for outlook. Okay?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's a pretty straightforward intuitive application. So it's a standalone web browser and we're able to, we could sync our personal outlook accounts. But if for all, like the shared email domains, we're able to have them come into a specific one. So here's finance support. We in like, you know, B to B customer like care kind of what you're doing. We sometimes see like an individual inbox for like large clients. And then all of that communication gets funneled into one place. Then when some, you know, you're collaborating with other team members, they would be able to come in here and see, you know, all emails that are unassigned that belong to them because I'm the assignee as well as team level emails. And these are emails that are open like ones that we owe or reply to. So that's kind of like the basic premise of we want to be able to collaborate better and see what's going on.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yeah. So similar to let's say Zendesk from what I can see, and it basically helps you let's say in terms of visibility to have everything managed. And then you can have different tags, status assignees. Okay?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yep, very, we replace Zendesk quite often. Okay?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  What's your let's say advantage compared to Zendesk?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's more email centric. So, I think Zendesk is better at like classic ticketing. Yeah, and being able to, I don't think Zendesk like Zendesk is okay for B to B. Yeah, but it feels a little impersonal at times, you know, like reply above this line like normal ticket stuff. But what essentially ours allows you to, do, you know, similar to Zendesk full template library… we have an AI assistant that will help draft emails. So let me start from the beginning here. And then you can upload like any knowledge based articles or like kind of free form documents.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Into this and it'll use this as like a knowledge source and how to write and craft these emails.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Okay. So you have the ascii as a panel on this side. And then, okay. And then when you click insert, it goes in the let's say email section. Okay?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then I could share this draft. And then I could reassign it to a different person on my team to review it… or I could just come down here and add mention them.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And the big thing is anyone could come in and see these emails that belong to the team. We can also do like AI based tagging. So this is just essentially creating like a filtered search of show me all emails that, you know, meet this criteria… could be a specific client or something else. And then we also have a concept of a view which is, it's just like a filtered search of like show me all conversations that match the following criteria. You know, it could be any status contain certain tags et cetera.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Okay. Interesting. Yeah. So you can basically let's say tag them if ever you want to go back in the past for a specific case that was related to, I don't know, invoicing or whatnot. Okay. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And then finally, everything in here is searchable. So… if I look up Tony stark, I'll have like every single email from Tony in one spot.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  But yeah, this is kind of what we're working on. Do you all use Zendesk internally?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  I'm not sure because that's not with my team directly. So I'm not sure.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you all use shared inboxes?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Me personally, no, I don't I have just my own.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  But no, it looks good. And then how long has your company existed for?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Seven years?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  So, okay. Seven years and your customers, where are they mainly?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, they're global… North America is the largest hub, but we do business across Europe, Asia and South America as well. And.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Then for let's say for the support because here all this is in English. Do you support French as well?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So the interface would still be in English, you know, like… all of these statuses, you could write them in French. I guess status you couldn't but these like custom fields down here could be in French. And then our ask AI works in French.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Okay. But then, so let's say for the rest, we'd be limited for English UI then, yes. Okay. Is there a plan to have it in French? Or in other languages or maybe down the line? Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  We're rolling out Spanish first. Okay. Do you have a big hub in France or in Montreal?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yeah, I'd say in Quebec, a lot of customers like it to be in French that's usually let's say one of the blockers.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, I'm aware of this.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  My curiosity is related to languages because I mean, I'd be happy to talk about your product, but I know that if French is not supported as a language, it's more complicated.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I've actually worked with a few businesses out of Montreal at a previous company like brown shoes and roots. Yes. Yeah. And I know about the requirement of being able to localize the interface to French Canadian.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  So, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, that's I'd say a little bit more complicated.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it is.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  But everyone understands English. So, I mean, that's quite straightforward too. Then you can use the air in French. But, okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yep. And then, you know, we do have all analytics like user permissionings automations around these shared inboxes but if you don't really have shared groups at the moment, I'm not sure if this would be like super beneficial.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yeah, not for me personally. I mean, like it's interesting to understand that and, you know, to be able to talk about it kind of have a better understanding of your product but then for me personally, that, you know, it would not apply.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Well, that is all good. Yeah, it's if there is like support operations happening where, you know, if you learn about like a shared email address in the future, This is a very powerful tool. Yeah. And it's mostly around like assignment and just ensuring things don't like get missed would be like the biggest pieces. And then, you know, you kind of build on that with csat surveys like… various reporting methods of like, you know, who's doing all the work. And then we have like AI quality assurance on every email.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So you can start judging, you know, or you can measure your employees and team based on, you know, their quality and completeness of work.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Okay. And in terms of let's say your typical customer, what is the let's say typical number of employees that they would have? Does it range around 200, around 500? Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I would say typically, we have around like 10 to 20 users on the platform. We have over 3,000 customers. So I think the average skews a little lower, but we also have pretty large deployments at like financial services groups like capital one that has like thousands of users, global logistics companies, and then for like more like classic B to B account management and customer success. I think it skews a little smaller like closer to like the 10 to 20 seed.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Range. Okay. Yeah. It makes sense. Yep.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  North of that, everyone wants to implement Salesforce or another, you know, CRM solution.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yeah, no, but I mean, like this, it looks good for let's say more like internal processes and probably for like consultants or people who have just as you mentioned shared mailbox even probably HR or whatnot. So… yep. I mean, it's good to hear about that because I, you know, I never saw the product and mainly heard about Zendesk. So at least like, I know that this exists too. So thanks for the overview.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Of course. Yeah. I'm actually working on like 160 user deal right now to replace Zendesk at a like a U. S based advertising company.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  So, okay, nice. Yeah. Congratulations. Oh.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Thank you. But I guess the point is like, this is very robust and can replace Zendesk?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Can support? Yeah. Makes sense. Well, I mean, if you have 3,000 customers, and then I already saw that there were a few big names too. I mean, I'm confident that you're able to support it? Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Of course, it looks like Cameron had reached out about the gift card campaign. Yes. Did we, is this the best email to send it to the?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Let's.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  see what I have here? I,

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  can send you, my personal email in the chat if that works for you?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that works great. And are you in Montreal yourself?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yes. Well, just up north, 30 minutes from Montreal. So, a little place called the Lorraine, not sure if you've heard about it. It's not very, I.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Have heard about it. OK. I'm a big skier, so, I've been to tremblant.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yes.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Tremblant there. Yeah. So it's basically let's say kind of like halfway from Montreal to go to tremblant. Where I'm at like in the middle between Montreal and tremblant?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. It's for me. It's always so scary driving at night up there during the winter because the roads are so reflective with all of that. The ice melting, oh.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  No, it's been something also this year, like I think today, we have sun and it's not snowing but it has been snowing nonstop. I mean, where are you located?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I'm in New York City, OK?

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  New York City, the company is in California. So you guys are kind of scattered across the U. S. I'm assuming mainly, yep.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's mostly New York. I guess customer success is scattered but sales is New York and California.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  OK. So east and west coast then? Yeah, I know here, the winter in Montreal is quite brutal but it's nothing compared to Russia. I don't know if you've seen Russia these last few days and then just like the huge quantities of snow that they have and people have to like jump out of their balconies and apartments to get out. It's that's like another level.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's like the, those videos are insane.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Yeah, no, no. It seems like a, someone edited some content or what? Because it doesn't even seem realistic, but yeah, no, it's crazy.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, it was very nice to meet you.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  It was nice to meet you too. Alex. So I do on LinkedIn if ever, you know, there's an interest or whatnot, I'll be sure to put you in touch.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Please do. Thank you so much.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Perfect. Thank you for your time. Thank you for the presentation too.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Of course.

Isabelle Niaufre (isabelle.niaufre@vision33.com):
  Take care.
