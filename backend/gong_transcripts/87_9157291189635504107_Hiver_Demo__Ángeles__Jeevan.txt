Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, angelus.

Odilesb:
  Hi, hello, it's Odile. Sorry, I beg your pardon for the delay because I thought it was mid and I didn't have this zoom on my PC. Okay? And I don't have, the camera today with the computer. I'm connected. So also, I beg your pardon, and angelus, she will connect later because she could not arrive before. So if you one weekend start you and I.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Why is it all? I'm so sorry, I didn't get your name. If you could just repeat that.

Odilesb:
  Odile.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. No worries. Odile. I think you and I can take this conversation for today. I'll just quickly introduce myself. My name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver as well as your point of contact.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'll be helping you with the evaluation today. I did see that, you know, you have already created your trial account wherein both are the users. The mailbox has not been set up yet. So we can probably explore that. I would just like to understand to begin with in terms of what made you look out for a tool like hiver and what exactly you're trying to achieve so that accordingly, I can tailor the conversation.

Odilesb:
  Okay. Well, I'll explain you, we are a campsite, well, a group of two campsites and a hotel. So… we are interested because we have to manage several email accounts, one for each camping, one for the hotel. We also have an account of a customer service department. So we have several accounts to be in charge and we are several persons working on this account. That means sometimes somebody doesn't know what to answer. So we postpone it. Well, we are working with a system… that is not the best and that's why we were looking for something much better and more actualized. So the idea is that we can all of us reply the emails, but with the possibility that's what we saw on the trail, that we can assign us the emails that we don't know or somebody is in charge of, I don't know cancellations. There's only one person that is in charge of every time there's a cancellation, we assign the task to this person for example, or also we work a lot with… I don't know the word in English, but standard replies. I mean, we have replies already prepared.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No.

Odilesb:
  Because most of the times, the questions are the same… but we are looking for something that helps us to… reply more easy because we are always working with copy and paste and this is not actualized either. No, we are looking for a tool that makes the life easy. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Makes sense. Would you just help me understand like what platform are you using today? Are you doing this from Gmail itself or any specific tool that is in place?

Odilesb:
  We are using. Gmail.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Only, right. Perfect. And you said there are multiple of such accounts for customer support. There are for hotels for campaigns. So, are these like different generic accounts that are being shared by multiple people?

Odilesb:
  Well, we have all the accounts and everybody has the password from each account, and that also, it's not so secure because we also have a staff for the season that they only work for three months. And at the end, it's not the most secure way of working.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that makes sense. Especially if people are coming and going and only working for a specific month.

Odilesb:
  Got it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And would you mind sharing? Like how many of such accounts do we have? Which would need the access in hypo in terms of like how many accounts are you handling?

Odilesb:
  We handle one for each campsite. So, it's two, the hotel, three and the customer service, four accounts… that we manage between several. Well, in winter, now, we are three, four, four people who replies on these emails. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, there are total four users who are going to be part of hypo, right? Apart from you two, there will be two more.

Odilesb:
  There will be more users because in summer period, we can incorporate at least two or three more people. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. And also, I would love to understand in terms of the individual logins, especially since you mentioned that you have people working part time as well for like a few months. So, for hypo to work like how you have used your own email addresses, both of you, we would require other team members also to have their individual logins. Like will they have that? Yeah.

Odilesb:
  Not since now because they had the connection directly to the account. So it was not necessary but we understand that with this system, we will need to create an email account for each worker. So we accept this. I mean, we agree with this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. You are okay to introduce those accounts for?

Odilesb:
  That, of course. Perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Sounds great. Cool. Then probably we can look into the tool and we can see and understand how this is going to, you know, cater to the exact pain points that you just discussed. So allow me to share my screen with you and we can keep this interactive until you can ask me any question as we go along. I hope you can see my screen now. Yes, yes, I do perfect. So just a quick introduction of hiver. It's an AI powered customer support platform that spreads across different functions within the company. As long as we have a generic email address that multiple people are, you know, responsible to manage it. Hiver as you would already know sits right within your Gmail itself. So you don't necessarily have to use a new interface. You just simply log in using your own credentials and you would have your primary inbox as it is. So hiver will have nothing to do with your primary inbox that you are handling. Hiver's. Functionalities are going to be in these yellow colored icons that you see here. So as you can see, these are the different folders that I am part of today. In my company. For example, I have finance healthcare info support. These are different accounts connected with different email addresses catering to different functions in my company that I am part of today. Likewise, we will add all the five or six users that you would want to be part of these accounts, like two for one for hotel, one for support and two for campaigns that we are going to be creating. And you can accordingly add and delete people as you seem fit, right? And that's how they will be able to see all the inboxes that they are part of within their Gmail itself, right? That's how the setup is going to look like. Once we have done that, I'll take an example of support here just to explain the workflow here. So there are a couple of things that you would notice number one is you would have these sections that are going to define your day to day workflow right now. Every email that comes in is going to come into this section called unassigned, which essentially means that these are the brand new emails that we have received in the support inbox. Once you look at the email, you can actually see the sentiment on these emails, you can see what the sentiment is, which happens automatically from AI. And as you click on the email, we can also further categorize them with the help of tags. So these are the tags that you can create from scratch as per your own workflow. That will help you sort of understand what this email is about. For example… you mentioned all the emails which come with the cancellation request, right? So we can have one tag created as cancellation. And we can actually create a workflow which says that whenever an email comes in, which has a tag cancellation. And by the way, AI will automatically start applying this tag for you once it learns the behavior that, okay, this is the kind of email they are applying cancellation tags. So let me just apply those on their behalf. So as soon as a tag gets applied as cancellation, we can create an automation which says that the email should get automatically assigned to let's say, Yukta because she's the one who is handling all the cancellation requests, right? So that we don't even have to manually assign email to the right person. Rather with the automation that email will automatically get assigned to Yukta, right? Either case right now, I just manually assign this to myself and anybody can assign emails to anyone. It's quite transparent that way. So that we have that flexibility whenever we perform any step in hiver, it gets recorded as well. So you would have the activity log at all times, so that we know who has done what. And once we give the ownership, you will see an assigned section, will only have now two emails pending. Now, the email that has been assigned will come into the mind section of that person, right? So this is where I can see all the emails that are assigned to me. Tags are helping me understand the nature of the email. So it's easier for me to really understand and just, you know, do the needful that's required on any email? Any questions so far from the assignment or tags functionalities? No, it's fine. Understood. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. No worries at all. One thing that I would still like to mention here is since you are going to be handling multiple of such shared mailboxes. So if I'm part of let's say four of these, I would not want to go into each and then see what are the emails that are assigned to me individually, right? Rather, the assigned to me section here. That you see, this is where I can see collectively across all the four inboxes, what are the emails that are assigned to me? And I can see, okay, this is from finance inbox. This is from support and accordingly, I can pursue these from here itself right now as the email gets assigned here. When I go and respond to these emails. Now, you mentioned you have a lot of repetitive responses that you're sending every day, copying, pasting those responses. We can rather… upload all those responses in the email templates in hiver right here. So this is where you can create different folders or put all your templates that you would like to use or the team would like to use and anybody can create these templates. And while I'm responding to any email, I don't really have to copy or paste anything. I just click on the email template here. Either search for the right template, or I just go into here in insert this template. If I need to make any changes, I can do that. If I want AI to help me sort of better, this email, I can do that as well and just hit send. So this is a lot faster in terms of dealing with the standard emails or requests that come in on a day to day basis. Is this something that you were referring to when you said templates?

Odilesb:
  Yes, but we work with six different languages. So all the email templates we have are in six languages, all the replies. So it's a very extended templates. I don't know. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do you have like separate replies for, in each language? Exactly? Yeah. So you,

Odilesb:
  can create the same reply. The same reply is in six different languages.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Six languages. Got it. So you,

Odilesb:
  might that means it's a lot of templates. I don't know how we should manage this. A folder in Spanish, a folder in English. I don't know what would be the system. Yeah. So seeing that, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Please go ahead. You were saying something. No, well.

Odilesb:
  That was everything. I don't know how you manage this case.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So basically, here, you can create different folders. So there is no limit in terms of the number of templates that you can have in hiver, like you're maintaining those templates in different language within a different folder, maybe a word or a Google sheet. You just have to replicate that here. Like you can create folders for each language. What you can do actually rather is create folders for each language. Let's say Spanish, English, French like that. And then in each folder, you can then put templates there within that language itself, right? So I think that could work in order to segregate from the language and then go into the specific folder and then choose the right template from there. Okay?

Odilesb:
  Because can you show me again how you look for a template when you write an email? So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  When you're here, you will go into the email template section. This is what it's going to show you, right?

Odilesb:
  Because you can search by word, you can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Search by word. Yes, but it's.

Odilesb:
  not necessarily a word that it's in the title. It can be a word that it's in the text. It could be, yes. So when I.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  write working, so it's giving me working which is in the inside that response and not in the heading or the top or the well that's.

Odilesb:
  quite fast. In fact, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So this is going to actually help you for sure. In terms of even if you create it from each language… and put it in the folder. I'm sure this is going to still work to search for those. You can just search it by like putting a keyboard and that's it.

Odilesb:
  Okay. And then you said you can get help from the Ia?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes. Yeah. Sorry. So once you put this here, no worries at all. You can actually ask AI to probably fix grammar, expand this, make it professional, make it empathetic, however you would want. And in whatever language it's going to be, it's going to give the response in that language itself. So if it's in Spanish, it's going to give in Spanish only.

Odilesb:
  And does it propose you a reply or not? I'm sorry, the Ia can propose a reply.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  They can propose, yes, yes, they can propose a reply as well. So, this is the template that you're using here, which are your standard response that you already have that you would like to put in hiver, right? Another way of responding is to actually use ask AI in hiver to draft a response for you. So when you ask AI to draft a reply, so AI will read that email. If it's in Spanish, it's going to suggest a response in Spanish itself. Okay? Is this what you're asking?

Odilesb:
  Yes, this is what I'm asking. Yeah. So this is.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Going to help you sort of with the response, all you have to do is you have to train AI, so we can put the knowledge source in terms of your company PDF documents, anything exactly. Yeah. So you can.

Odilesb:
  Program the.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  yeah, you can program.

Odilesb:
  For it? Yes, yes, yes. And.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Then you can just insert this response in hiver itself like this wow.

Odilesb:
  Okay. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Sounds good. So we just have to put the knowledge source in the backend and AI will train itself on that, and it will give you the responses in the language that you want.

Odilesb:
  Okay. One question because I've seen you were recording the meeting. Yeah. Is it possible to get the copy of this? I will.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Share that. Yes, I will share that. Yes, thank.

Odilesb:
  You. Thank you. No worries. Okay. That sounds great. Perfect. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think once this is done, yeah, I can just send the response and then I'll change the status. So you will have three status in hiver to track the progress on each email. So any email, yeah, that comes in when assigned to someone, it's going to be open. Once you reply to that email, you can either mark it pending. If you're still expecting more response from the other side, you can just, or you can just close the email if it is done so that accordingly, you'll be only left with the number of emails that you have to actively work on. And all the closed emails will come into this designated section here and the closed section or in the pending section, right? And if you receive any response on any reply on the closed email or a pending email, that will come back into the mind section for you so that you can take that up. Okay? Yeah.

Odilesb:
  Sounds great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. And so this is going to be the individual workflow. As to when an email gets assigned to me. We can actually also see across the team. If I click on the team section here. This is where we can see across the team who is working on which email, so that it's easier for us to collaborate on emails. So I can actually see how many emails Jeevan is working on. He has two emails that he's currently looking at. These are his open emails. If I want to get a quick summary, I can get a quick summary as well here to.

Odilesb:
  understand.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What really happened? If I need to give him or mark him any note, I can just add mention him right here so that to collaborate on any email. So this helps us sort of not having to forward any email or mark each other in CC? Rather we can just collaborate on any email within hiver itself in this internal collaboration box. Okay? Any question on this?

Odilesb:
  No. If they are not assigned because I understand that these are emails assigned, but we normally, we don't work well because we are not used to obviously, but we are not used to assign emails to our employees. So it's you know, it's in the, all the emails from the account. We just reply them. And if we don't reply them, they are as unread.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I mean, that's because that's what you're using in Gmail, right? But you don't know because nobody is the owner that's why we don't know who actually replied to which email hiver is actually going to help you understand. Okay, we have fortifying emails right now, but who is working on which email? You don't necessarily have to assign an email to a specific person. But even if you just go ahead, pick any email and start reply, it's going to automatically get assigned to you. So that for other people specifically, they know that, okay, you know, Odell is already working on this email. So we don't have to then rely on the read and unread functionality of Gmail. Rather, we will look at the progress from status as to what is the status on this email, whether it's open pending or closed and who is working on this from the assigned section here. So this is how it's going to change from how you're doing things now and exactly going to help you achieve that. We know at all time, who is working on which email, which is attended, which is not attended. We have two emails which are not assigned to anyone. So now you can come here and actually reply to this email. And even if you don't assign this to yourself, if I reply this, it's going to automatically get assigned to me because I have already taken some, right?

Odilesb:
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is how it's gonna be. All these are the.

Odilesb:
  ones that are open, but we normally close them. We don't have that much pending emails. So, can you see with the closed ones who has worked on which email? I mean.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is where you'll have your closed emails. Okay? We can see for the closed who closed that email, what happened on that one? So you can definitely see that as well. Okay?

Odilesb:
  Okay. Yeah. Great. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Anything else apart from this that you are expecting from a tool? Because I think from what you mentioned, I've just tried to cover all of that. Anything else apart from this?

Odilesb:
  Well, I miss angeles because I'm sure she has a lot of questions. Maybe we could program another… email. I'm thinking… we could connect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Again, that's fine if you want to do this tomorrow. If she's available at the same time, I'm happy to do this tomorrow.

Odilesb:
  Okay. Well, if you can send a record, so she can also have a look on this record. And in case we have more questions, we will contact you asking to meet again.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Could you mind sharing your respective roles? Are you taking care of the entire function here? How does it work?

Odilesb:
  Is the main boss from all the customer departments? Okay, reception and customer service booking, central, etc. And she's more well, I'm more on the daily I'm in charge of the department also, but on the daily work. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And she's I think the it manager, if I'm not wrong, yes.

Odilesb:
  Yes. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Cool. Then. So you can discuss with her. Is it possible to just schedule a feedback meeting wherein we could connect again? And you could tell me how you would like to take this forward from there?

Odilesb:
  Yes, yes. But it's what I'm saying. I don't know her availabilities because today, she was supposed to be available, but unfortunately, she had something, but, so let me ask her if you don't mind if you can send an email with the record and we will reply with the following possibilities… of meeting. Yeah, I don't know tomorrow at the same time she will be available. I have no idea. No worries.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And I'll also put my calendar link there in the email so that you can just freely book another time as to the availability from her site as well. And yeah, we can then take it forward. I'll just share the recording and other details on the email.

Odilesb:
  Okay. Sounds great. Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. Thank you so much. Take care. Bye, bye. Oh, wait, no.

Odilesb:
  Well, one moment, please hold on one moment. Yeah, show.

Odilesb:
  Well, maybe the doubt from her side was more about the budget so, well, if you can, also after I explain you what we need, if you can make also an economic proposal… I can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Actually share that. I was going to ask that also like if you have any budget assigned for this already. So these are the different plans that we have, right? We sell in a bucket of five. So we'll be requiring minimum five users to use hiver and it's going to, I think I will recommend the growth plan which is at 25 dollars per user per month. So this is something, yes. Just now, I have another.

Odilesb:
  Question. You can also add the whatsapp on?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can add whatsapp as well. So it's going to look like this. This is how you can connect your whatsapp here there?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Sorry. Yeah. So whatsapp is it going to be only to handle your incoming messages?

Odilesb:
  We have whatsapp from customer service. So our customers contact us by whatsapp when they have something… when they are in the campsite, it's not for bookings or it's more a help telephone while they are in the campsite.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, yeah, I think you can, but the only thing is, if you connect your whatsapp in hiver, you will not be able to use it on your phone, or on web. So you can only then handle it from your desktop in Gmail.

Odilesb:
  But then also one, whatsapp is handled by several users.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you then multiple people can handle these incoming messages. So, if you just want to use whatsapp to handle the incoming messages, if they are in bulk, you want multiple people to be able, to be able to respond to these messages at the same time, then, yes, this can work very well. Not.

Odilesb:
  Only this, it's also templates or, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Then you can use the same templates which are here to respond to these messages.

Odilesb:
  That's nice. Also. Okay. Yeah. Can you say you can not open it on your telephone?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it will not open it on your telephone? Yes.

Odilesb:
  And how do you do with all the media files that we receive? Because normally, we receive well, customers use this whatsapp telephone for sending us videos and photos of things that happens to them,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So that you can open it here itself in hypo in your desktop?

Odilesb:
  You need to send something as well. It also works. You can also, you cannot.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Initiate any conversation from your side as a fresh conversation.

Odilesb:
  You cannot initiate a new. Okay. No, no.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, you cannot initiate a new conversation and that's the condition from meta itself that it does not allow you to initiate any conversation, but you can manage all the incoming messages that are coming in now, then that's a.

Odilesb:
  Problem because, we initiate a lot of them. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So then that could be a problem here. Yeah. So what you can do, you can initially use it just for your emails to handle your inboxes.

Odilesb:
  Yeah, we can start with this because.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Whatsapp? Yeah. Whatsapp is part of the pro plan. So if you need whatsapp then at later on, we can consider to move to a pro plan… but the,

Odilesb:
  four accounts we have and,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks for reminding me. I think we'll be looking at the pro plan itself that in that case, because in the growth plan, you can set up to two shared mailboxes, and more than two. If you have four or five, that's going to be part of the pro plan itself. Also the AI piece that we just talked about wherein you want AI to sort of help you draft those responses. Like what we discussed, that is also part of the pro plan itself. So, the ask, AI piece is also part of the pro plan. Okay. So all in all, we will be looking at the pro plan itself and later on, if you want to add whatsapp, this is whatsapp is already going to be part of this plan. So you can always experiment with that as well.

Odilesb:
  Okay. And because, for example, the staff, we work the whole winter, we could have the pro, but we, as I told you, we incorporate employees for three months that maybe they only have access to two accounts. Not only the ones who are, the whole year working, we have access to the four accounts, but the ones that will come to help us. They only have access, for example, maximum two accounts. That means we could have this growth for them. Everybody will.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  have to be on the same plan. I understand what you're saying as long as you're adding users from your domain, everybody will have to be on the same account. If you have any budget. I'm happy to sort of be flexible. We can offer you some discounts as well. Since it's also in the usd, we are more than flexible to sort of, you know, accommodate to your country currency and also work on your budget if you could share it with me. So we can always explore that. So, I would want force that the product really works for you. And as for the cost, we are happy to sort of accommodate. But as of now, do you have any budget for this project? Anything that's aside? No, no, no.

Odilesb:
  And I'm, not in charge of this part. So, I'm just getting this information for angeles, when she will see this record video that she.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Could inform her that we are pretty flexible so we can always accommodate as, for your budget, some somewhere between growth and pro, for the pro plan. But this is the plan that I would recommend and we can first do the trial. We have a free trial as well in which we can set up these inboxes, see how it's working. And if only when you are satisfied. And if you want to implement this, I'm happy to work on the cost alongside with you. Okay? Because.

Odilesb:
  for these stuff that works only three months, is there a price per month or you have to pay the whole?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you can either go with the monthly package or you can subscription. Okay?

Odilesb:
  Okay. Okay. Let's do that. Please. Let's let's if you can send the email with the recording, and your calendar there we.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, also, just last thing I wanted to understand or do you list, is there any timeline by when you're looking to implement this? Well, maybe as.

Odilesb:
  Soon as possible? Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And, and these users that you've mentioned was four or more. So you said like three, three of them would be like for three months only. So, is it like out of these four, is it going to be three people are going to be only there for like three months or is it going to be more than four people in total?

Odilesb:
  For the whole year, we will be four, maximum five, no, four. And then, yes, we incorporate.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Three.

Odilesb:
  Or four more users for the summer, but it depends because… if the tool helps us, maybe we don't need so much.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I mean, that's true. If you can automate certain things, then you might.

Odilesb:
  Exactly. We need the stuff because it's not so so easy to work. Yeah, that's true.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. Let's start with the five users. Let's keep five as a starting point. And once you're ready, like you can let me know then over the email, you can book a meeting and I can help the trial and other, and we can take forward the evaluation from there. Okay, perfect. All right. Thank you so much for your time, thank.
