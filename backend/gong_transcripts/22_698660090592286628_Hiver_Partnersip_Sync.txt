Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  hey, what's going on? What's up, Cole? How?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We doing? How's everything? Sorry? What was that? How's everything been? Yeah.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Kind of slow kind of busy?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I know it's been like, it's been shockingly busier than I expected this week. Usually, this is like the dead period where you're kind of in the nether sphere. Nothing's happening but it's been busy this week. I.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Think some people made last week their nothing week. And so at least here like Monday, Tuesday, no one was here but I was here now. It does almost seem busier today than it was like last on the 20 second, so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah, I feel like just the way Christmas fell this year, that's how people treated it.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Yep. How was your trip?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It was good. It was good. It was a good time with the family. My brother's sister was there both my parents and then my little nephew. So it was a good trip with the family and the caribbean.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Fun man, fun times.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Did you get up to anything over the holidays or just hang around home?

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Pretty much just hung around. Yeah, went to my wife's family's place a little bit the weekend before Christmas, so we did that, but then, which is only a couple hours away. But then, yeah, my family lives in town here. So we were just with them Christmas day. So hanging out pretty much.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, can't beat that. Yeah.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  I know. Yep, I'm nice… but no.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I appreciate, you know, you hopping on Jared, so I know you and Jeevan had a pretty good conversation last call and kind of went over pricing a little bit. Does it seem like just from how it's gone so far with the team? Like does it seem like you do want to move forward with hiver as a solution?

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  I don't know because I don't know if he updated you on some of the stuff I said, but I kind of got to this realization where the people that I have trying it out, I don't I think there's a different solution for them. There's nothing we're already paying for with the intercom. So we're trying that out. But I do possibly still have this gap here for my dedicated csms and what I need to do is I would need it to be identifying… if it knows that this is a customer or not, you know, which I can do with some CSV uploads and things like that. I just haven't done it yet, right? And so I'm probably out of time with the trial which is okay. But I think, I think there would be a solution, hiver could like fill a gap for me with a group of maybe like five to 10 people that are not going to be in this pooled system that we have for intercom. So that was kind of a recent realization that I had last week after talking with him and realizing what we were doing like this could actually be great for that. But, I just don't know if I'm ready to do it right now. I mean maybe Q1, that would be the thing, but I'm not going to get anything done but, or the other year, but I think it could be a good solution there. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. We're happy to extend out the trial, to, throughout next month too. So if you just want to like actually get the team in, kind of start testing it like you can have all of next month to test as well. That.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Would be, that would be huge because we are trying to get the like our new stuff. Our ideal date is February one or we're kind of rolling on that. So that would actually be perfect.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. Yeah, I can also bring in a resource on my side just to understand, you know, kind of map this out with you as well for next week. I kind of do this after, the new year. Yeah. So if you had some time next week, we can put like, you know, like a little bit further.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Sounds good. I might bring in my manager that's going to be handling the, this stuff and have her kind of test some of that stuff too. So I might bring her into that meeting if that works. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  When would work for you next week?

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Let's see here. I'm going to look at her calendar too. Looks like there's a couple you're an eastern, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes. Okay.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  So, two 30 eastern on the eighth is open one 30 eastern. On the sixth is open. Wait, sorry, I think I got this backwards… two 30 eastern on the eighth or three 30 eastern. On the sixth. We both have open… Wednesday morning. We might have some time here. It looks like.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Wednesday, could you do 12 o'clock est, your time or nine o'clock your time, PST?

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Well, I'm central, so that would be.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, you're central, right?

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  11, so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 12 would be 11, your time?

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  We don't… really have any elevens, maybe on Friday the ninth, we could do 11, my time, 11 a. M.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I can also do nine 30 your time on the seventh.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  That would work. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, nine 30 your time, and then, yeah, 10 30 my time, that is perfect. So I will update this to then. So that is on the seventh and then 10 30 my time. Okay, cool. So I'll just ship that over and then, yeah, you can just add or forward the invite to the.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Person who?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Would manage that. Cool. All right. Awesome. Now, I think we have some good next steps here. Do you have any plans, for New Year's you doing anything for the night?

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Yeah. I got two little kids now, so we're at the stage where we're going to go to, we're going to get up, we have a babysitter but we're going to do early dinner, five 30 and then get a drink after and probably be home around 10. So, which actually sounds great and fun to me. So we did it last year with some friends. Yeah, that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Sounds lovely. I think.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  We're going to do, how about you? I think?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We're going to do the same thing. I mean, we don't have kids, but we're just like we've been traveling moving around a lot, so we're probably just going to hang out.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Yeah, nice. It's kind of nice. Oh.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It's the best New Year's kind of like honestly sucks going out. It's just like such a rat race. It's hard to get into places. It's yes.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  Yeah, no doubt. Man. Cool. We'll.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  enjoy it. Yeah, enjoy. Enjoy the New Year's I'll talk to you next week and let me know if there's anything I can do in the meantime.

Jared McCoskey (jared.mccoskey@companycam.com):
  OK, cool. Sounds good. Thanks, man.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Bye.
