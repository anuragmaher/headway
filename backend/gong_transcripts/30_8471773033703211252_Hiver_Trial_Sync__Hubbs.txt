================================================================================

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  my sound.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Hey, Matthew. Hi… are you with Frank running the team? Oh, there you guys are checking. Oh, yeah, back again. Hi. Hello? Hi.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  It's just the two of us today. Frank will not be joining us. He has said you handle it guys. It's no problem.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Well, we'll get you enabled on my side. I'm joined by Manoj. He's a little under the weather this morning.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Hi, guys. Hi, Matthew, Frank.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  But he's like our lead solutions consultant and will help us, you know, get you set up on the trial. So we're rocking and rolling.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Before we jump into it, I know that you met with, you know, Jeevan last week? Anything else… that you want to cover before we kind of go into trial setup and kind of what that all looks like?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Well, we have been testing already the last week. We noticed some things. For example, we find it very difficult to test in the sandbox environment because we find it difficult to really get a good hang of it. How do you test this if it's not your own situation? So, for that reason, I think we think it's better to, if we, yeah, go ahead and implement and then, yeah, just go and work with it. So you have it in your own environment.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I think that makes a lot of sense especially without, you know, the live emails coming in and being able to experience. Okay. So, did you download a hiver instance to one of your emails or both of your emails?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  What do you mean with the hiver instance?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Or did you download the hiver extension in that case for the demo?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah, no, we have installed the hiver extension in Chrome and then we've set it up with, jaim. Yeah. Okay. Great.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Well, let's you know, I'm going to, I'll kick it over to Manoj in a minute. But from… my recollection, there were a couple of key use cases and does, let me just take a step back. Does everything come into? Was it like two email addresses or is there like a single email address that is shared across the team?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  No. There's there are several email addresses shared across the team, but one is just for work orders and one is for communication and we would like to go ahead and start getting the hang of it in the mailbox where we just received the communication because the work orders are not that. Yeah, it's just a work order with an attachment, nothing else. So, yeah, it would not be much of an addition I think for that, but for the communications mailbox, we would like to start with the behair mailbox. Yeah, it's a very all around mailbox with communication with our customers, but also with our tenants and the people who are renting out the houses to us. So, yeah, that's the first mailbox that we are… going to implement it. And then if we, and yeah, our team is getting hang of it then we, yeah, then there are other departments within hubbs who would really, who could really benefit from something like hiver. Yeah, for sure. Great. Well, we'll.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  step through then setting up that shared mailbox in hiver. Yeah. Then I think we should add some custom fields and like either tagging or custom dropdown fields to be able to like categorize these conversations better. So then, you know, whoever logs in is picking up the right conversation kind of within their work view. Yeah. And, you know, we could do a little with AI summarize or AI tagging if that's interesting. But I think, we start with those other pieces and then we, you know, we'll talk through the use case further with you. What?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  We, we do have some questions also which we would like to have answered. We do get some spam emails which are not really spam, but they are marked as spam. And they now come into the Gmail folder. It's called spam. I've noticed or we have noticed that the spam folder is not accessible from my own Gmail account with the hiver implementation of the behair mailbox, if you understand what I mean? I do.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Let.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  me. Yeah, yeah, let me take that. Okay. So first things, first guys. So hiver does not have a spam filter or a spam folder of its own. We depend on Gmail's spam folder.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Now, let's say that when an email that is sent to the shared mailbox is marked as spam by Gmail itself, right? A couple of things happen. Number one, the email gets removed from the shared mailbox and syncs into the spam folder of every user. And the second thing, if any one of the user goes into their spam folder and marks it as not spam, it gets added back to the mailbox for everybody.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah, that I understand. But I would like to avoid that every now and then we have to go to the spam folder physically to get it marked as spam. Yeah. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, as an alternative, what we suggest is that there is a Gmail filter that you can create. Yeah, you know, if these emails are coming in from a centralized email address or based on a specific subject line, you could always create a filter like emails coming from. So, and so do not mark it as spam or do not send it as spam. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  But we don't know it. We don't know it in advance, no, but I think that if there's… a mail sent to the mailbox to be here and it's wrongly marked as spam, then we all get it dead mail in our own spam… box. Oh, yeah. So.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Every,

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  individual can release it again. Oh, yeah. Okay. That would be great. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, you don't have to go back into the source account. And as soon as you know, everybody will have access on it. Like if anybody finds it and anybody can add it back to the mailbox from their own account.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay. And another question about the folders because at this moment under behair, you have unassigned mine team, all views. And… yeah… is this adjustable or is this a given? This is just, it's this and, okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, can you click on all views? You will see two more sections which is pending and closed.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. So.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Unassigned mine, team pending and closed are the default ones. Yeah, which correlates with the status of the emails. Okay? But again, you have the ability to create more custom folders based on assignment based on the category of the email or, you know, based on any other custom fields that Alex mentioned, it's totally up to you. These are just to get you started. The unassigned is for all your new emails. As soon as an email is sent to the mailbox, the new email comes under. The unassigned mine section is exclusive for every user. Yeah, team section is to see who's working on what. Yeah, pending is, whenever you're putting a conversation on folder. Yeah. Okay. And closed is all your resolved emails?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Closed is just all emails. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, resolved emails. Because in hiver, when you open an email, yeah, when you open an email, you see the status on the right hand panel, right? Open pending and closed? Yeah. So unassigned mine and team will have open emails, pending will have pending emails, closed, will have closed emails. Okay?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay… great.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  This answers the second question.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  At this moment, we are working, we… have tested the behear email box in the hiver environment, but we are still working on it in the Gmail environment, which gives a really big disbalance in the available emails. As soon as we go ahead and start with hiver all together as a team, would we get a clean start? So you take the behear email as it is at the point of starting to work with hiver or how is that? Yeah, how does that work?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, you mean the new trial that you're going to start right now? No?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  We still have a trial until the end of the week because, okay, our trial is extended because of the New Year's Day. And, yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Understood.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. So we still have the trial until this Friday. So, I think this Friday is do or die. Okay, me and Matthew are going to decide if we go ahead with hiver. Yeah, latest this Friday… but if we go ahead and then we set a date… with each other to go ahead. Do we get a clean start based on all the information we have now? Or should we do the cleanup of the mailbox in hiver ourselves? Because there's a, yeah. As I said, if we archive an email in the Gmail environment, hyver does not recognize this as an archived email?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because archiving… is simply removing the inbox label and hyver does not deal with the inbox label but see guys if you know, yeah, let's say that you go ahead with hyver. I can ask the team.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  To you.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Know, maybe close all the emails before. So, and so did, yeah, so that all the older emails are gone back into the closed section, you don't have to worry about the closed section and you can just start fresh with the unassigned starting number zero.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  That is that's I think that should be a doable task that shouldn't be a problem at all. I can ask the engineering team to sort it out for you.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay. And then we do have a lot of emails in our mailbox, which we… still use.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Some of them are folders with a label and some of them are archived, but we look them back. Alex last time told us that it's possible to get all the email into the hyver environment as well. What time would that take approximately?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, this totally depends on the volume of emails that you guys want to bring in. Yeah. Okay. Because see one thing if it is going to be the entire history like let's say three or four years worth of emails, what… we ideally do is we kind of import them in batches so that is not heavy load on your Gmail account. Yeah, right. Because we will be using Gmail's API to fetch all those older emails and sync it to each and every user who's part of the chat mailbox. Yeah. And sometimes when we cross a certain threshold, Gmail's API gets exhausted and you guys might hit rate limit, exceed error. Yeah. With Gmail imposes, when there is a lot of use of API, right? So we don't want that to happen. So, we usually do the imports during weekends and during offers, and we do it in batches. Yeah. Okay. Now, yeah. Can you just tell me approximate number of emails or how much data is there?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. I was trying to look it up because sometimes Gmail shows it.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  But, yeah, it's all, it's like going to the dentist when you need it, it's not there.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  If you are in your inbox… can?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  You scroll down and see at the very bottom where it says number of GB.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah, it doesn't show at this… moment. It's not showing. I'm sorry?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. No worries. You guys can check it out and let us know through email and I can work with support team and, you know, show you the import steps and, you know, the necessary information that you need for the import process.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  And then you have several different subscriptions. I must say… one of them is growth, one of them is pro and one of them is elite… based on the communication that we had. What would you recommend from your side?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you'd fall into the pro bucket just in the sense of number of shared mailboxes, you.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  know.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Is more than two. Yeah, and being able to consolidate multiple emails in email aliases into one shared email inbox is also a pro package. So that would definitely cover pretty much everything that we've discussed. There's some extra bells and whistles in elite, but that's typically more for like regulated customers think like healthcare, financial services, et cetera.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay. So you would say it's the pro and it's 65 dollars per user per month. And is it a monthly payment or is it an annual payment or do you have also different pricing when we go for annual payment or something like that?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So the annual payment's at 65 dollars per user per month. And then we have a month to month option where there's no commitment and that's 85 dollars per user per month.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay. And it's yeah. Okay. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  What further questions did we have? Yeah, I think this one is for Manoj.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  During the testing in the sandbox environment, there were several things like the, how do you call it the empathy… the sentiment, yeah, the sentiment and also the SLA, and we noticed that while clicking through the mailbox, those disappeared and they just, they only reappeared after refreshing the page.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Do you know, what may cause that? Is that the setting in our own environment or?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  That shouldn't be the case. So, the sentiment analysis is the AI feature which reads the tone of the email and gives you whether it's neutral and we are happy mode that should be visible.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So,

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  on the email list view, you should see that. And when you open the email, you should see that on the top like below the subject line that it shouldn't disappear. And even the SLA policies once it's applied, it should be applied right there. You don't have to actually refresh or do anything.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  We can tell you if we share our screen.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, please do.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Because I have synced… it because the tags are visible. I don't know if you see my screen?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Already. Yes, I can. Yeah, I can see a Gmail.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So the tags are visible only when clicking through them. The red mails. Then the tags disappear. And after refreshing and loading, however, then they appear all as they should only with clicking got.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  It. Got it. Now. I can see the problem. Can you go back to Gmail? Sorry… I just want to see if we can toggle to a different view and see if it still happens. Then, you know, I can just escalate it to the engineering team. Can you change the split view? Yeah. Now… refresh. Okay. Can you click on an email… on the right hand side? Can you open the hiver, right? Panel… in case it is being visible or negative. Can you go back now?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Then it stays.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, only, when you have the split pane view, it's disappearing… every time you click on an email, right?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah, it seems like that. Yeah. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Just hold on a second.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Can I ask you a question about the view? The overlap? What do you mean? Well, if you open this and it's completely empty.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  And you open it again, it always opens at the first email and you can adjust that by saying reverse. The only thing it does is the next one. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  We don't need, I'm.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  just trying to. Yeah, sorry.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. I was saying we don't need an ancestor anyway. It's also something you can look into and get back to us. It's no problem.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Got it. No. I'm just trying to check a few things on my end. But yeah, I think it's just with the split pane view. You're having that issue? Yeah, I'll get that checked with the engineering team. Yeah. And… what?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  I, what I also would like to know is one of the things that we are really used to, in Gmail environment and is the, I don't know how you call it, but it's… the non expanded view. So here I have one email conversation which contains 12 emails. When I open, it opens the last email and all the other are, yeah, I think you say collapsed. But yeah, if… I… now go back to the inbox and open this email again, it keeps all previous emails collapsed and only opens the last email, whether it's unread or it's read, it's that doesn't make a difference. And if I go here, to the same email in the hiver environment all.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  The emails are extended, right? Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  And, what I have learned via the chat is that I have the possibility to change my personal settings with reverse order of messages. Yeah… which is… okay. But I've and all change is difficult. But this is one of the most difficult changes for the team. I would reckon in order to work with hiver, is that every time you open email, it goes to the first email in the conversation unless you reverse it. But then your order is of course reversed. Is there somewhere in the future that maybe, yeah, this is in development, maybe, at your site or? Yeah, I'm curious about it. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Believe me guys, we have been trying that for a while right now. Okay. That is kind of, yeah, that is like kind of like a restriction that we have when we are on top of Gmail, right? Yeah, there have been other customers who have also raised the same concern. Our engineering team did look into it, but, you know, last couple of times we hit a roadblock, but again, okay. You know, we are constantly checking what can be done on that. Yeah, one of the, so if you notice whenever you open an email within the shadmail box on.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  the.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  top, you will see a Gmail label search result. Yeah. Right. Like on your Gmail search bar, you will see a bunch of labels which is searching through the emails even when you open an email. So, since we go through that process, you know, all the emails are automatically expanded. Yeah. But yeah, I will share the, yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Now, I understand because all those emails share the same tags. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, I will share the feedback though, right? Because, we haven't missed it out. To be honest, we have that in our mind, we are thinking of ways to make that possible. I'll be sure to share any kind of update that I'll have on that.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay. So, it's something still in the research. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Great. Yeah, that's something I was really curious about.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  We have, we have been trying to do that. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Of course. Yeah, it's well built by Google, but it's difficult to work around when working with. Yeah, I think it's a layer around Google, right? Yeah, yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Well, for the operations, I think that were the questions we have until now, what I would like to know for as far as the next steps go is if we go ahead, we start to work with a number of people working in the behavior box. And after, we are, yeah, we are getting the hang of it.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  We're going to expand it throughout the rest of the company. And does that mean we can also start with just me, Matthew, six… accounts and then just expand as soon as the rest is going to be working with hiver as well. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, we, yeah, provision licenses and buckets of five users.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  You know, six would be 10 and then so on and so forth. Then… as, you know, scale up and add additional team members, you could have some ongoing like implementation and customer success help. So we, yeah, we have the in app chat which you probably have seen.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, chat.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  With them at any time, we also have a little bit more like dedicated resources for teams of 10, like if you buy 10 seats or more.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  We.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  have additional resourcing to help you get the most out of hiver. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay. Well… at this point, it's up to me to up to me and Matthew to talk to Frank about this. Yeah… if we go for annual monthly, how many users will we start with? We are enthusiastic to start implementing it for real into, but, yeah, it's quite a big expense. It's more expensive than the back office we are using for the guys working outside. So, yeah. Yeah. Well, at this point, it's also still a little bit difficult to say what? Yeah. What, what will it, what will it bring for us? Yeah, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, I think there's two, two different things I want to address there. One, if you were to bring on everyone on the team, how many users would that be? Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Well, we have 214 seats in the office. So at this point, at this point, not all are filled. So I would say 10, okay. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 10 users. And… so you would kind of need that out of the gate as well. And then in terms of seeing value, you know, like let's say we're really kicking off the trial like today, maybe we give you two weeks on it because, you know, between like figuring it, you know, it's your Monday is already over.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So really, you have like three days before Friday and maybe we extend it one more week to the next Friday. I don't know if that would work just so we collect a little bit more data. Yeah, then.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  We can try to activate it and then you would say just add the rest of the team members as well, so you can really work with it inside the trial.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  That would be our recommendation.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. And then… just work with it as far as it goes for the new emails. And then after everyone is on board, you say, then go ahead and implement all the old emails as well. So you still have to be a little bit switching between the two, but, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, every new email that comes in will automatically go into hiver. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Of course. Yeah. But yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  There would be a little cleanup of old emails. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay. Yeah, I think that's the best way to go now. Yeah, yeah, I think so too… if we go ahead and extend the trial for another week, do you have to know how many people are, which users are going to use it or is it just up to us to install, add them to the shared inbox and have them install the plugin?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's just up to you to add them to the shared inbox?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay. That's just as long as we have to try it's free for us to do it like that. Yeah. Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay. Then I think we should go ahead and go… and really test it in our own email box. Yeah, right. I.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Think so too. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Great. That would be very helpful. Thank you for that, Alex.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Of course. Yeah. And in terms of pricing, you know, if you're open to an annual contract, you know, you have a little bit more flexibility in terms of, you know, the per seat costs. So if we're doing 10 seats, but we'll cross that bridge if, yeah, when we're there, yeah, if this still looks like it works for you?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay. Great. Let's just go ahead and do that and do it like that. What would you recommend or prefer in terms of a next meeting?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, maybe we do a check in either and like… we could do a check in Wednesday, Thursday or Friday?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  I would say Wednesday… since, yeah… does it have to be Wednesday? Yeah, since we are already going to work from the hiver environment, I would say Wednesday so that if we say Wednesday, yeah. Okay. Let's go ahead. I've rolled away then we can maybe schedule the implementation also for the Friday. So then we have the weekend in which the emails could be maybe… important. Great.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  We could definitely do that. What do we want to accomplish on Wednesday? That's different, you know, like do we, for Wednesday? What would you like to make sure we are accomplished? Just so we show up?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah, for us, it's the day we're going to say, yeah, let's go ahead and continue or we say, yeah, we've tested it and it's not for us. Okay? And then it's just, it could be a short meeting just between the two of us. Yeah, not the two of us but yeah, between.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  the.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  group, yeah, when you?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Say Wednesday, are you talking about Wednesday the seventh or Wednesday the fourteenth?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  I would say Wednesday the fourteenth. So it gives us seven days… to test it around the team. Yeah, great. Well, we can.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Definitely support you in that. And then finally, just like you, have, you chatted at all with our technical support team using the in app chat?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  I've did. Yeah, just a short question, but it was, yeah, it's crazy how fast the response comes. Yeah, it is.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Well, if you have any questions and, you know, obviously you can CC me, I can loop in technical support as needed but that's typically how we support you throughout the trial. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah, I must say, I think more questions will come as soon as we're going to test it in our own email box because, yeah, the knowledge base is really great. You can find a lot of information also in just a step by step. Yeah, just by following the steps on the subject you are looking for to get answered. But also the chat works. And as soon as we're going to go ahead and say to the team, we're going to work with hiver from tomorrow. Yeah, we're going to start with it tomorrow. Then for the trial, then more questions will come. I'm sure. So we go ahead and go find a way to the chat. Yeah, no problem. Great. Well.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
