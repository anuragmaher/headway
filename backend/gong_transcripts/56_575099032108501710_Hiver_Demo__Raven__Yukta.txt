================================================================================

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Raven. Hi, Farhana. How are you guys?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Hi, Yolanda.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, how are you?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  I'm good.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Shall we get started with the discussion or expecting more people to join in as well?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Give me a moment. Let me check with my colleagues.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  All right. We have everyone here. So, I think Yukta, you may start the demo.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  All right, great. Thank you everyone for booking this demo with us today. My name is Yukta, and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver, and I'll be helping you with the evaluation. The agenda for today's, meeting is for me to first understand in terms of what exactly you guys are looking for, what's your current process and how you would like to change it to a new system. And accordingly, I'll be in a position to sort of show you what hiver does and how we could find the fitment that you could potentially use hiver in your company. So, yeah over to you. If you could just help me understand these things, we can take it from there.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. Thank you, Yukta. So basically right now we are looking for a CRM solution which can help us to manage our customer service requests. So we are actually a travel agency. So on a daily basis, our customers actually will send in an email request to request for the quotation, it's either on flights, hotel or other travel relevant products. So at the moment we do not have any technology solution implemented which meaning to say we are tracking manually. Actually we couldn't really keep track like how many requests we are receiving every day and then what are the status? So most of the time our manager will be just tracking manually. So yeah, we are looking for some solution which can help us to ease our manager's work in terms of tracking the customer email requests. And then maybe to have some… ticket or case management to track the status of all the requests, whether it's completed or it's still pending. And then we can from there can actually assign like the case or the email request to our staff. And then to actually track their productivity and the response time. And other than that, we also would like to have some features like the staff, when they're managing the request, they will be able to input notes or some comments from the customer. Because sometimes we may have to hand over the case to another staff for this customer request. For example, during working hours, staff a is handling it. But after office hour, it might be hand over to staff B who is doing the standby duty. And other than that, we would also like to have some status tagging so that everyone is clear on the status of the request. And most importantly is to actually like having a report or dashboard for the manager to oversee the client requests and the staff performance. So all of this if there's another CRM solution which we can keep track based on the customer information, that would be great as well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Thank you so much for giving me these details. So currently, I'm assuming that this is the customer support team that we have here today?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yeah. With me, Farhana, Lia and Anna, so Lia and Anna, they're actually our regional and corporate manager. So for Lia, she is actually managing a few branches with her. She's having a system who is managing a respective regional team, and Agnes is also managing another corporate team. So both of them, they have quite a few teams and staff members reporting to them. Yeah. So the two actually, we wanted to see how we can make use of it to let our manager to keep track of all the requests. Yeah. And Farhana is our customer experience manager. So for her, she'll be, because sometimes the customer, they will actually feedback to Farhana saying that our team is responding quite slow. So, which is why we would like to have the solution which can help us to track the response time of the team members, so that we can actually feedback to the customers. How is our team responding? And how we can actually improve from there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Got it. So we have three managers who are taking care of different teams in the company. Is that right?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And what about you, if you could talk to me about your role as well?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Same as Lia and Agnes?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So which team are we looking this for specifically? Is this for all the departments in the company or like specific team that you're currently handling, who takes care of all customer related communication or is this for different departments?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  It's for our reservation team, where our travel consultant will be the ones that are responding to the customer request on the quotation for travel relevant services?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many people do we have in the reservation team today?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Around 40 to 50?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, these 40 to 50 people are working on these emails and responding to these emails on a day to day basis?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And you would want all of them to be using a technology solution to sort of manage these? Okay. And how many, like how do you, how do they do it today? Like do you have a generic email address at which your customers are reaching out to? And then these 40 to 50 people log into that outlook account. How is it currently placed?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  We have generic emails for each team. So all our customer requests is actually going into those emails.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, that's what I was trying to understand like under reservation team. You said 40 to 50 people. I'm sure, these 40 to 50 people must be belonging to different, you know, different departments. There are five generic.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Emails.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. There are five. Okay. So these 40 to 50 people are distributed between five teams and each team has its own manager or a supervisor, and then they have their respective team members who are working on these emails.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And are they, do you use shared mailbox with an outlook via which they are handling these emails or are they all logging into the same account and then picking these emails up?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  They are using outlook as an email engine, and then these email accounts are shared across different users. I mean, they have their email set up on their respective laptops.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. But, and these 40 to 50 people, they have their own individual outlook accounts as well, right?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  They do have.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Perfect. I think this helps a lot in terms of understanding how things are happening today. So you mentioned, you know, so to summarize the top challenges with the current process, of course, since everybody is logging into the same account and then handling these emails on a day to day basis. I can only imagine how difficult it could be to really understand who is responsible for what, although you have the tag system within outlook, but still, even if you tag this tag those emails market against someone, it gets difficult to track in terms of how much time they are taking to complete the response on that. What is the status there? In terms of, you know, tracking the progress on each ticket? How we are assigning these emails amongst ourselves? I think those things get really difficult. Is there anything else apart from what you already mentioned, Revan or anybody else can come and talk to me as well in terms of something that is sort of a must have or an important thing for you?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Tim, Farhana, Lia, Agnes, do you guys have anything you want to add on?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Nothing from my side. Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Also, Tim just wanted to understand like, is this the first time that you're evaluating a new tool in the market?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Is there any timeline by when you're looking to sort of implement or finalize on, you know, having this?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  I think it would be best for us to review all the tools by end of this year, if possible. Maybe we would like to implement it next year, first January.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. In January got it. And I'm assuming that you would be evaluating different tools for sure, and then you would have a final say in terms of where you would want to try test it and then eventually implement it. Is there a reason why we are waiting till end of this year? I know we are just two months away, but what if you like something, we go through the process? I show you the demo, would you want to sort of test the tool? And in case you find the solution before January, would you be open to implement it by then or the timelines are sort of fixed?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  I think we are flexible, giving us time until end of this year is because we do need some time for proposal to our management and for his review.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Since you mentioned proposal, are you looking within a certain budget?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Maybe let us just look at how the solution works and then we can talk about commercial later.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. I can do that. And towards the end, I can also show you the pricing of hiver so that it'll be helpful for you to sort of take it ahead to your management. Perfect. Let me know if you guys can see my screen?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Thank you for that. So just a quick introduction team, hiver works on this URL called app, hiverhq. Com wherein you would be logging in through your outlook email address that everybody has today. When you're logging in. Of course, you should be marking yourself available. You also have the visibility in terms of the entire team who is working today, who is not working. So that someone who is out of office, new emails do not go to them. And we don't miss out on those emails. Somebody else can pick those up in their absence. Now, as you can see on the left side, we have our personal inbox. And then we have our shared mailbox. The idea that we have our personal inbox here as well is for you to not having to switch between outlook and hiver, if you would like, you can still manage your personal inbox. Of course, since hiver is configuring your original inbox and then giving you a view here, your original emails are going to remain as it is as they are today. In outlook, there wouldn't be any change in terms of the activity. The only change that you would notice is rather than handling those emails from outlook, now, you will be handling them in hiver. So talking about the shared mailboxes, as you can see, I am part of different shared mailboxes today, like finance, operations, healthcare, sales support. Likewise, we would be creating these shared mailboxes for your team which would be connected to these different teams that you have within the department and add respective people, respective team members who need to be part of a specific group. I'll take an example of support here and show you how the workflow looks like. But before I go there, any questions from the setup standpoint?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  So basically, they're going to log into the hiver portal, and the hiver portal itself will integrate our outlook emails into it, right? For the team to work on.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that is correct.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. All right, perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  All right. So here, in terms of the workflow, as you can see, these are the sections that will define your day to day workflow. Let's say I am part of one of the teams here. And all the emails that are going to be written to this email address are going to come into this designated section called unassigned. Which essentially means that we know these are the emails which nobody has started working on. Yet. As I clicked on this email, you would notice these are the different fields in hiver that will help us define our day to day workflow starting with the assignment or giving ownership in terms of who is working on this email. So I can actually go ahead and assign this. Let's say I assign this to myself, this activity will get logged in real time. So anything that you do in hiver in regards to any email, everything gets recorded, so that we know at all times who is making what changes. And as I assign this to myself, you would have noticed this email is no longer in an assigned section since we have already given the ownership. We know now who is working on it, and it will go into their mind section to whom we have assigned this to. So I can see very clearly in terms of what are the tickets or what are the emails that I am responsible for, we can still go into the team section here and across the team. We can still see in terms of who is working on what. So that we have complete transparency and visibility since it's a shared environment. Everybody is working here in order to collaborate rather easily and handle these emails. So if, in case my colleague Rakesh, if he's out of office, he's not available. I can easily go ahead. And if I need to cover for him, I can just go here, understand what's been happening in this email and bulk assign these emails to myself so that I can take this up while he's not here, right? So that we don't miss out on any email. I can also do this wherein if let's say my colleague is currently working on this email. And I think let's say I'm a supervisor or I'm a manager. And I want to know why this email has been sitting for past 24 hours. And I want to understand that I can add a quick note here and we can talk about anything. Let's say I ask for an update, please update here. And I can just mention him so that Jeevan will receive a notification in this bell icon here and he will see. Okay, Yukta has mentioned me somewhere. Let me go ahead and see what she's asking and we both can talk and share these internal notes. While Jeevan is the ultimate owner on this email. And this is something that could be useful for the case wherein you mentioned, I am currently working on this email. Now. I'm logged out. I'm done for the day and if there is a response on the same email and I want let's say my colleague and he's going to be available once I have logged in, I can say, could you please take this up from here or leave any note that you would like in order for him to be able to best respond to this email that has come in, right? Or if he wants, he can just go ahead and assign this to himself as well. So that now it's in his radar, he can just take it up and reply to the email. So this is how you would be able to easily collaborate across the team at all times. Everybody has that visibility understanding of what's going on, how many open emails? And by the way, all these emails that you see in the mind section and assigned or team section, these are your open emails in terms of the status. So all your open emails are here for your visibility understanding and knowing that, okay, these are the open tickets that as a team, we are currently handling any question on this in terms of the assignment before I move ahead. Okay, I'll take that as no. Perfect. Cool. So the assignment part that I just showed you, we can automate this process as well team. So we don't always have to assign emails between ourselves manually. We can set up certain automations in the backend which will allow you to scale this for larger teams or to just make processes a lot easier. So in the automations, if I go, I can just create an automation for a specific type of email that comes in. And if it has a specific subject keywords in it, let's… say new booking or… interested in a tour or something like that? Anything that helps you bifurcating these emails and direct these to a specific person who is responsible for all such emails, you can directly assign it to them, you can also create tags to sort of bifurcate your emails into different categories. So if you want to create a tag called new booking and you want to just directly apply that tag as soon as an email comes in with this subject in it, you can just do it right away from the automation here. So the workflows will help you sort of defining your day to day workflow and making it a lot easier in terms of automations. Do you think this could be helpful? Any? Question on this. Do you have any scenario that you would want me to replicate?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yeah. I think this is good. If I say we have a customer that we want to assign specifically to some of the team members. If I say we have some emails that are not relevant to the customer request, say, for example, like some promotional emails, are we able to filter that out?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, we can do that. So, do you currently have any filter and outlook for such emails that they're automatically going into spam or something?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  We are setting the email rules to filter out that?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So either you can do that from outlook or in hiver, if they are coming in the inbox, and if they come with certain keywords, I'm just taking an example, writing support. But if you find certain keywords there in the subject or the body of the email or if it's coming from a specific email address, let's say no reply at the rate. Hiver. Com. And, you know, that this domain always gives you like promotional emails. You can just directly go ahead and close those emails so that they never bother your workflow. And they will just be sitting quietly in your closed section.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we can definitely close these emails with this. We can also set up the SLA, like you mentioned that you would want to track the progress on emails. So for that, it's always best to have certain policies that you can create for entire team wherein let's say we set up these policies, you can set it up for a specific tag as well and have it a different way for a specific tag.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So here, let's say I say that if the first response, which means if the email gets assigned to me, and if I do not respond within one hour, then, you know, I would have breached the SLA. And if I do not close it within 24 hours, again, I would create, I would breach the SLA here. So these SLA targets would help you having better understanding of, are we relying or are we adhering to certain timelines or standards that we are setting for ourselves and making sure that we are responding to the customer within this specific time? And if we are breaching these slas, what is happening? Why are we not able to reach out on time? And what is really going on that would help us improve as a team, right? SLA, is something that you could set up for sure. Any question on this, how we set up the SLA? Do you think this could be useful?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yeah. I think it's useful for us to keep track of our team's response time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, perfect. Would you also be having a csat? Do you currently send out any customer survey after the email gets closed?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  At the moment, no, we are just having like a link under the email signature of our team members. So if they have any feedback, then the customer would send a response through the Google form.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. Okay. So would you want to replace that with something like a csat which can be placed easily at the end of the email? You can have it as per what you want. And then on csat, you can also have a report in terms of how the customers are responding to these.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yeah. I think it would be great for the automation part.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we could have this as well. Perfect. So I think coming back to the main page here, in terms of the usage, I think we have covered the assignments tags, how you can categorize your emails and create a repository for yourself. So tags will come here wherein if you want to just go into one topic, fetch all the emails related to that, you just go there and easily have a look there. And of course, as we are responding to these emails, we can use email templates. So that helps the entire team be on top of these emails, be able to reply a lot quicker and faster. And if they need to collaborate, of course, we already discussed, they can share notes as well. And then once they are done, of course, they can mark the email as closed and that will sit under all views in the closed section so that all your emails that you have already worked on, they are not going to be disturbing you. If you receive any reply, they will come back into your mind section and will change the status to open so that you don't miss anything which is sitting in either closed or pending section. So this would be your workflow in terms of the agents and how they would be working, managing things from the supervisor or a manager or the leadership perspective. You could easily go into the analytics part here and understand how we are performing and track these emails on a day to day basis or probably monthly basis, quarterly basis based on what you're interested in. So you could actually see the workload distribution across this, across a specific agency, across all these shared mailboxes, you can go into each one and have those reports specifically designed for each one. You can see the response time here. You can go and look for each user, how many emails have been assigned to them? How they have been responding to these emails? What's the csat score? What percentage of people have given good ratings to each of our support agent? And that will help us sort of review these internally. And of course, then you can go for each tag as well. You can have SLA reports separately that you can analyze how much of our team is violating these SLA, how much of our team is responding on time and be on top of these reports here. And then lastly, you would have csat as well which you can always sort of track here. So these would be the different reports and of course, we have custom reports. You can create your own dashboards and all of that. But anything specific that I might have missed in terms of analytics or this is what you were looking for.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yeah, I think the report is quite useful for us to manage our team's performance.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah… that is correct.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  We can export the report, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can export it. You can choose any metrics here and you can export it into a CSV?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay, cool.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, perfect. I think this is it from my side feedback questions. Happy to help.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yeah. Tim, do you have any questions on the solution?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Nothing from me? Thank you… for fun.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. I was just interested also to understand riven, if you could answer for me here in terms of, you know, implementing or deciding to implement a new technology, I'm sure there are a lot of things that happen internally that makes you look out for a solution in the market. I was just curious to understand. I mean, at this point, when you are at like just starting out starting off your evaluation, if, in case it gets, you know, sidetracked or if you do not find a solution, do you think at this point you would be okay to have the current process going as it is? Or do you think that you would want to actually change it from how we are doing things today?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yeah. I think we have been quite traditional in past years. So I believe to increase our efficiency and improve the transparency in terms of how the customer requests being handled. So, I think it would be great for us to move on to have a solution and technology help us in this area.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. And with the demo and whatever you have seen in hiver, did you think that it is, it can be a little complex to use since I'm, assuming the team wouldn't be that tech savvy since they have always been relying on traditional way of doing the job or doing the work. So, what do you think in terms of the user experience of hiver? Because we keep hearing that the learning curve is a lot less because hiver replicates your outlook a lot and it has quite straightforward way of handling these emails or marking or playing with the hiver icons here. So from the user experience, what is your impression of hiver?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  I think from the demo that you have shown us, it's quite straightforward for me. It just maybe the team need to add on few more steps to actually update the status and then leave messages and notes for their requests. I think it should be quite manageable.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And are you looking to, if, in case you move forward, do you want to start with the entire team like of 40 50 people or would you want to first do it for one shared mailbox? And then, you know, do it for the other teams as well?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Yeah. I think if we were to implement this solution, we may need to implement it in stages, maybe not like 40 50 in one go. I think firstly, people might get shocked and it might be quite hard to manage everyone at the same time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think you can do that. That is fine. I think one starting with one team and seeing how it works for them and then you can build it. From there. We also provide onboarding assistance. We have a trial as well. So you don't have to immediately just start implementing hiver or make a decision. I would suggest that we do a trial for which goes for about a week wherein we can set up one shared mailbox, invite that team to be part of it, and we can do the training. We have customer support available 24 seven. So anyway, they can always reach out. We are available at all times. So that should not be a problem. But from here, what do you suggest we should do as the next step?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  I think maybe Yukta, you can share with us the commercial and also like maybe we can go for a trial session as what you have suggested?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. In terms of the commercial, it's there, although the website itself, so I can share this link with you. So we have two types of plans which is annual and monthly based on which plan you would want to go ahead since you're looking at five shared mailboxes. I think proplan would be good for you since it will suffice five shared mailboxes, you can add users. So each user will be costed 45 dollars per user per month. So yeah, I think this is the price that you could keep in mind. And of course, there is a scope of negotiation, understanding your budget accordingly. We can help you at that point. But I think first I would want us to come at a place that we are really confident about hiver and using the tool. And once we are at that final stage, we can always be open to have these official commercial discussions. And then we can sort of, you know, work on your budget as well. But this would be the generic pricing.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. So 45 dollars per user, meaning to say, if we have five general emails, then it will be 45 times five, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No. So these five shared, these five generic emails are your shared mailboxes. Each plan covers a specific number of shared mailboxes in growthplan. You can connect three of them in pro. You can connect five in elite. You can connect unlimited. You are charged on the number of users who will be part of these shared mailboxes, right? So.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Meaning to say the 45 dollars will be charged for those 40 to 50 users that we have been.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Using that is correct. So it's going to be 45 into 40 for like each user.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. But when those users they log into the portal, are they going to use their own? I mean individual email accounts?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So they will be logging into hiver using their individual account. So they are, so, as they are logging in, they are charged as one user.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. But in terms of the solution itself, it will be running on the five general emails, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So in the, in this plan, you would be creating five shared mailboxes, like today, I'm part of finance operations. So we will connect all these five generic email address and out of these 40 to 50 people, you can just add them in the relevant shared mailboxes, and as many users as you're adding. It doesn't matter if me, as a user, if I'm part of three mailboxes at the same time, that is okay. But it depends on the number of users that you would want to add across these five shared mailboxes.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. What do you think like in terms of the pricing as a first impression? Do you think this is something that could work out for you?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  I think that I would need to review with my manager. Yeah, because it's a monthly charge pricing, but in our pricing, it will be same, right? I mean, same based on this pricing. I mean times 12?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it will be same for everyone.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. Cool. I think it's the Yukta, thank you for the demo and also sharing the pricing from the website, I think we can actually review on these two. And I'll share this with my management. So, is it okay if let's say we get back to you for that trial?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. We can do that. I just have a small request if we can connect sometime next week wherein you and I only connect if required. And if you could just help me understand where we are, how you would like to take this forward so that I'll be, you know, informed as well? Can we do that sometime next week?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Next week, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, like the time when you think you would be able to.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. But in general to activate a trial session, what will be required?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We don't require anything as such. We would just be connecting your email addresses. So there's nothing required. So, yeah, the setup is pretty straightforward and it's very easy to do.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. But the trial period, will it be chargeable?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no trial is for free.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. Then, okay. I'll take this back to my management and then let us review and then get back to you on next week for the trial.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Next week, can we connect on the same day at the same time? Would that be enough time for you?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Let me get back to you on the date again.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You could do that, but just to, you know, have a placeholder on the calendar, I would really appreciate that so that, you know, I don't have to follow up and, you know, sometimes the conversation gets lost. So, if you could just have a placeholder for maybe on Thursday or Friday next week, and if you are not going to be able to make it or if there are any changes, you could let us know or then we can accordingly make a shift.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay. Sure.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Should I do it for the same day? The next week? Thursday?

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  I'm sorry, I couldn't really commit a time to you because our schedule for these two weeks are quite tight. So maybe let me just connect back to you via email is okay, right? Or you need us to actually set in a slot?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I will share the calendar invite.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Whenever you think you're ready.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  All right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  All right. Thank you so much for your time team. Have a great day.

Raven Sim (raven-sim@wahtunggroup.com):
  Thank you.
