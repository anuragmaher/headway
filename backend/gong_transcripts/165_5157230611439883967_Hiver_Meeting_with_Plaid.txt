================================================================================

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  hey, there, can?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  You hear me? Yeah. Can you hear me?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I can hear loud and clear. How are you doing today?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Good. How are you?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'm good. Thanks for asking. I want to be respectful. So, how do I say your name correctly?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  It's Yaa.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yaa. Nice to meet you. My name is Jeevan. I currently lead the sales team here at hiver. I know you met with my colleague matt yesterday and matt, he's on pto for the rest of the week. So, which is why I've stepped in. I currently lead the team that matt's on. I've been with the business for about seven years now, and in my previous roles, I've worked with a lot of our largest customers, helping them evaluate, build solutions and really deploy successfully. So, yeah, I'm here essentially to plug gaps that were maybe missed yesterday. I'm happy to talk through. I think you wanted to learn more about the AI, and there's also some integration questions, but also that's just what matt told me. If there's anything else that you've thought of since then, you just want to ask you have any questions, anything that you want to go over again? Let me know. I'm here to help?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yeah. We had a great demo with matt yesterday and I see some great features that your product have. And today, we're basically looking to see what AI capabilities that your tool has. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. So I'm going to dive into the AI. Yeah, because yesterday I read through, I read through pretty much all the notes he left me. So I have a fairly good understanding. You're currently looking for the Ar mailbox which is managed by a couple of people currently, that's just a group that's not been, you're not able to organize that with the kind of volume that's coming in and you're looking to see as much of this is as much of this as possible with hiver… and AI where we can add some value, and then we can go from there. So, is that a good understanding of where things are?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  So, right now, the Ar box is managed by just me just one person. Okay? But in the future, probably two or maybe three people got.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  I'll be managing the Ar inbox got.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  we have about an average of like 100 emails that come in from customers, every day, sorry, every day. Yes. And about half of those don't need a response. They're emails like auto replies or like payment confirmation, remittances from customers. So for those ones, we're looking for a tool that can just filter those emails out for me. And then that way I can just, you know, go into my Gmail every day. I can just see a list of emails that need me to respond. And maybe if it can like prioritize the emails based on like the threshold or if like there's like keywords, maybe say like urgent or something like that. If the AI, you know, feature can do that sort of thing. So it would be great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So yeah, two different things that we can definitely do. Firstly, let's start from, let's add some context, right? So when an email comes in, yeah, into hiver's inbox, right? You will connect your Ar inbox to hiver. And when an email comes into that, it will first and foremost, before it even gets to a human being, it is processed by our AI, right? And as soon as it processes it, hiver's AI natively does a few things and it prepares itself to help you in the best way possible. Number one, number two is when let's say I open, this email. If you notice it is first thing it does is read the tone of the email. That might not be very relevant for you because you're getting invoice emails more often than not. But even there, in case there is some, any sort of a frustrated email that's coming, hiver is going to be able to pick it up immediately, right? The second thing it does is it actually helps you set up something like a summary, right? So here is where we are able to automatically process that email and tell you what's inside. Right now. It can be a situation where it's… telling you that there is no invoice here or there is an invoice here, you can tell our AI to look out for that. And if there is just a payment confirmation, you can get information about that here as well. At the moment, I don't think there is a straightforward way to automatically close these emails. We can definitely do that, but I don't know whether there's a straightforward way for the AI to just close it out. What the AI could do is give you a very clear demarcation that these are all your emails with an invoice. And these are all your emails without an invoice. We can give you that distinction. You can maybe just like skim through it just to make sure you're not missing anything and you can immediately close those out and they go away on the other side of the spectrum where you spoke about prioritization that's something that we definitely can do. For example, here, if you notice the mri scan coverage, confirmation, priority not specified. So, in such cases, priority is not specified. But in certain cases, what we are able to do is… one second.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Trying to see whether we can find an urgent reply… right? So, whenever this happens, you can ask hiver to automatically, it says process priority, not specified, right? So you can get hiver to classify this as priority, not priority. And, yeah, so there's a lot that we can do is this along the lines of what you're looking for? Because if what you're looking for is just being able to… just close out emails, this is probably not, it. This is more to be used with one other person to manage an email together.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  I see. So where would I see the ticket summary? So, do I need to click into the email to be able to see the summary that is?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Correct. Yes. Okay. Because, yeah.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  And how does, so, how does it know if it's a priority or not? So, it's like based on like just,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  the content of the email content?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Of the email?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, content of.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  the.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  email.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Like how the AI is recognizing, if it's a priority or not?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Okay. See,

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  So, I would still even though like it recognizes like the priority, but… for like, the… ones that I don't need a response, it would not be able to like pull it into like a folder or something it can. So, I don't need to like.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It can definitely pull it into a folder and you can like then vet it and then close it out. So, for example, it would pull it into a folder like this. And then at any time you'll come in and see that these are all the emails that don't require a, or we think, don't require a template. You can just select all of them and mark them as closed.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  So, it would be a manual process. I would have to go into each email to move it to that specific folder like the AI.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  The AI, what the AI can do is classify it into two buckets. Huh. This is a bucket that says this has an invoice, this requires your attention, and it can put it into another bucket that can do the same thing and say it is, does not require your attention.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Okay. So, I can tell that. So basically say that we have like, 50 emails that come in. Those are remittances. And the AI can help me recognize those are all remittances. Yes. And then it would all move into the remittance folder for me.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That is correct.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  And how is it recognizing them as remittances? Is it based on like keywords that's a remittance?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, you have both options. Yeah. So the easiest way to do that is for example, you can actually set up either there are two ways to do it. You can either ask the AI, to read the email process, it, understand it and then make a decision. In those cases as you can imagine, not, AI is not 100 percent perfect. So you will have to maybe look at it one, or bet it once or twice. But the other option you have is exactly what you said, which is using keywords, you can actually define the keywords and say, hey, whenever an email comes in, if the email in the body, if the, there's a keyword in the subject of the email that contains the word remittance, or… there's a keyword in the body of the email that contains the word remittance, you can then automatically ask hiver to add a tag that says remittance and put it into a separate folder. And you can build workflows like these on yourself. So, this is a very, a simple workflow rule that you can create. But you can also ask hiver's AI, to process it, summarize it and then put it into a specific folder.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Okay. So, what if for example, there's email come in and there's remittance, but the customer also has a question about their invoice. So, for those emails, I don't want it to go into that folder, cause my expectation is everything that goes into that folder, can be archived. Like I don't need to manually review those emails. So, so how would AI recognize this is actually an important email and it needs to be in like, the priority, the high priority list, cause it can do something like that like, I'm just worried like it will get filtered out within like the.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly. That's our worry as well as always with AI because, we have to train it. And yeah, as you can imagine, it trains with your, usage a little bit, right? So, at the moment, if you are looking for us, easy straight shot way for the AI to come in, read your emails and say, this doesn't require an answer. This doesn't this does require an answer that's not what hiver does. What hiver is trying to do is it gives you a layer of functionality on top of your Ar, mailbox. So, if you've got one or two other people in there, you can assign it, tag each other, leave notes and also use the AI to respond to, to do other things. So, I'll, give you an example of what our AI is specifically meant for in your use case, right? For your, let me open this one, right? So let's say, and you use Netsuite. Yeah. Is that correct? Yeah. Right. So, we've, got a really powerful integration with Netsuite. Now, what that integration does is it allows you to pull information from Netsuite relating to that particular po number, or an invoice number, and you can pull information automatically right here. So, in this case, it'll say this is all information from Netsuite. It'll say vendor data, what is happening? What is the contact details? And then what is the purchase order? You can see all the purchase orders related to that particular, contact or account right here. And while all of these are all the, the, and you can see approval status, you can see id, you can see entity name and everything. And this is completely customizable. But the best thing here is actually, we have got a smart summary feature as well where it will scan your email. Our AI will read that this is a po, will automatically go to Netsuite, find information about that specific purchase order and come in here and give you real time updated information about that purchase order right here.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  I see.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So this is the focus of what our AI is trying to do?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Got it. And, did you mention that there's, like auto responses as well that your tool can do? Did you just mention? Oh, no. Okay. So, like would it have like, yeah, cause like there's some other cases we have is like customer would email us a request for a copy of like a W9 or something like a bank information? Yeah. And, I was looking for something that maybe can help me like draft, emails?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely, absolutely. So you have two options. Number one is you're going to be able to go into our temp. Again, you have two options. One is just a normal feature and one is AI, right? So, with the normal feature with the templates, you can create these templates on hiver. The best part about these templates is you can attach attachments to those templates. So when you use them, that attachment will automatically come with it. So, in this case, I'm going to use this one and I'm going to say, yeah, I tried insert template and that template gets added here. Now, let me try, so finding a better,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So, in this case, it's automatically being pulled up as the previous person's name, I click insert template, and then that will be added here. You can also, if you're writing a rough draft, yeah, and you just want AI to clear it up or clean it up, we can actually improve writing or make it professional and everything. So I can say, improve writing. So it can take your rough draft with all the information and the attachments. And it will give you a better version of the same draft. So you don't have to spell check, and go and so on and so forth. But this is part of the templates. We also have a copilot that will automatically help you draft a reply. So, it will read the email. It will go through it and it will give you three options, which are very relevant to your department. It can say, connect to a billing specialist, share onboarding overview and clarify invoice details. So, let's say, I want to clarify invoice details. I just hit three and depending on previous interactions that you've got, depending on, how things work, it can automatically write a response for you.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Oh, I see.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So, as you can tell, it will use information from the reply. So, in this case, it will say using, for following, details, please issue the following and this, it knows what to ask for because our AI has been trained accordingly that whenever we need to ask, for more information, this is the, these are the, the, items that we require.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Got it. Yeah, I really do like that copilot feature there.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Okay. Yeah, I think I got some really great information from you. Thank you very much. I do need to discuss it with my manager and the team together. I believe that matt did share, the pricing with us yesterday.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I think so. I think he did too. He sent you a pricing page, but again, that's just our lift price just to show that you get an idea. Yeah, right. And, and of course, if you need any assistance or if you want to discuss further, we're always happy to help. Yeah. Just last thing before I let you go. Remember, we spoke a week. I think we ticked a lot of your boxes. The one thing that is still unclear for you is, how would hiver know whether something is just a remittance information or remittance information and a question, right? So let me tell you and let me actually show you how we can help you set this up, right? So this is called AI tagging, right? So what this does is it will read your email. It will look for things that you're asking it to look for and it will tag it accordingly. So I'm going to say configure, right? So it's going to be able to give you all of these tags. So I'm going to say add a tag. This tag could be a cancellation request. Okay? Just as an example. So I want to see all emails that have a simple cancellation request, be segregated elsewhere. I don't want to, I can archive it. I don't have to see it but I want it to be segregated elsewhere, but I don't want it to include emails that have a cancellation request along with any other question, right? So the way you are able to do that is you can choose this and then you can go to manage tags or you can train AI. And then… one second… cancellation request here, it is write down. So you will have to actually show it 10 such emails that you wanted to go in there. So it learns from it. But more importantly, you can go in here and give it a description in this description. What I'm going to say is please include all emails with just a cancellation request. This must be include standard cancellation requests and should not include any emails with additional… questions, information or concerns, save changes. Then you give hiver 10 email examples. You select 10 emails that have already come in that should have gone in there so that it learns from it. And then from that point on, it will start tagging your emails automatically.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Got it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And you can actually test it as well just to see whether it's working correctly. So if you go here and you can see view emails, so you can actually test it for. Okay? So these are all the emails that I've got and the reason is that this is actually got a cancellation right there.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Got it. That's pretty cool.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, there's like I said, there's a lot that we can do.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yeah. I think just like requires a little bit like training with the AI as well.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  AI just needs to get trained even when training, we maximum require 10 examples and that's good enough for us for our AI to sort of like build that pattern and go from there.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Oh, wow. That's great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Cool.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Any other questions? Anything else that you think is pending that we haven't discussed yet? I know you wanted to talk about the Netsuite integration, but as you can tell that's, very powerful, it's probably one of our most powerful integrations because our AI can really like grab information from Netsuite directly and bring it in here. So, yeah. So, would.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  it be able to like pull invoices invoice copies for us from Netsuite as well or?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Can you give me a scenario?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  So, like for example, like the customer is asking, hey, I want a copy of this invoice. Would it be able to like integrate with Netsuite and pull the invoice? The invoice copy?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So it won't be able to pull the invoice copy. I will have to check. Maybe we can, but here's what it can do depending on whether you wanted to look in Netsuite based on the po, number, the invoice number, or the contact of the person emailing you, depending on whatever these are, you can go. If, for example, I am in your Netsuite and I have an invoice against my name. If I send you an email to your Ar, inbox, all hiver does is it looks at who is sending the email, or if I mentioned the invoice number in there, it looks at it and immediately checks in Netsuite for that particular record or that particular contact. And when it finds, it automatically grabs all the relevant information about that contact or that invoice and brings it automatically to hiver as a sign in a card. So you don't have to go and search in Netsuite, we do the retrieving the information, retrieving for you. I know that in that card documents, like actual attachments cannot be brought in but I can check with my team on if whether there's a way for us to bring it in other ways because we're bringing everything else in. We should be able to bring another attachment in but I can check with my team if that's a major requirement?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yeah. If you check, if you can check on that for me, it would be great because I would say like 20 to 30 percent of requests that we get in is requesting for a copy of their invoice.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. But what we can do in that scenario, right? Is we might not be able to bring it in like give it to you directly, but we can hyperlink it right here. So, P o US 25, it says, hey, I'm requesting a copy of purchase order, P o US 25 or 30. Hiver will automatically give you all the P o S that are related or all the invoices are related to the account. You just click on it and it opens Netsuite directly in that invoice.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yeah, that's great. I do like that. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  One click and it goes straight there.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yeah, yeah. I do like that because yeah, sometimes I do need to go in and search for the accounting Netsuite and that takes a bit of time as well.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, here's how here's where it really helps. And I'm sure you face this, right? You actually have a lot of different people who are repeat customers, right? So, for example, Sophia Lee in my account right now, if they look, she has one, two, three, four purchase… orders right now, right? And there is a fifth one which has come in right now. So, what hiver does is it actually like I said, automatically analyzes, it brings all this information here. It says it's rejected. So, you know, what's up, but if you want to get a copy of this invoice, all you have to do is click on search. In apps. When you click on search, you don't even have to copy paste the search. It will actually give you a smart search suggestion, which is, hey, you're looking at this email, you're probably looking at this specific invoice. So I click on, it automatically pulls up details from Netsuite and all I need to do is just wait for it to load. And then the actual invoice is mentioned, right here, you click on it. You're taken straight there.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Okay. I like that. That's pretty cool.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Like I said, it is definitely one of our most used integrations, one of our most popular integrations.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Do you have a lot of customers that are like used by the accounts receivable team? Like.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, would not believe. Yeah. So we didn't intend for that to be the case when we started, but over the years, we've just had so much success in that space that we've built a lot of functionality for that use case. So, for example, we have approval flows that no other ticketing system does, right? And this was built for our accounting customers. Recently, we've onboarded the entire, the accounting team at thrive market if you've heard of them as well as the entire collections billing and invoicing team at udemy, all of them currently use hiver.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Okay. Got it. Cool. Great. Thank you so much. Yeah, I'll discuss with my manager and we'll reach back out soon.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Sounds good. So, in case, I don't want to get in touch with you before you're ready. So, yeah. So what is a good time that it's good for matt and I to just circle back for an update to see where things are?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  We're pretty busy this week and probably the first half of next week because we're working a month at close.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Yeah. So probably.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Like towards the end of next week?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Towards the end of second half of next week?

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So here's what I'll do. I'll just send out like the same invite for like over a week from now towards maybe Thursday or Friday and we can, that's just a placeholder. We can, we can always skip if required or at least schedule if required. But it just gives matt an opportunity to follow up with you when he's back because he's not here and I just want to put something on his calendar in the meantime, sure.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yeah, totally understand. Yeah, thank you so much. This was super helpful.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'm glad thanks. Have a good one.

Ya Zeng (yazeng@plaid.com):
  Yeah. You too. Bye bye.
