  That's a fact. And then where's the, he didn't they didn't live in fairfield, they lived next to.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It was like norwalk stanford.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  Stanford and then bridge, Stratford, stanford, that kind of area, trumbull. It's my bad trumbull Stratford was their neck of the woods.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, trumbull's a good town. I like trumbull.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  So, all right. Who am I, why are we here? How did we get here?

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  So, Sean gill her it director, small company. It's me my system engineer who you can't see off camera. And then we have about 120,000,000 in rev, and then about 202 150 end users. We have an MSP, we're leaving the MSP, and we need to have our own ticketing software to track them. All right? The MSP will still be floating around in the background doing what's called like a managed security service for us, but we'll be doing all the help that support. Hence why I'm talking to you. This came up in the call a long time ago in a galaxy far away when I was literally your age, I worked on remedy, which is the grandfather of ServiceNow. So I built my own itsm suites, my own trouble tracking project management solutions that was back in the day. And then what else do you want to know? I think I got all of them there.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I think that's pretty much a good background for me. Okay?

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  I know what I want to tell you. So what we're looking for is a small simplistic trouble tracking system that he and I would use however and my boss has got like a pet peeve on data security data retention. Now, our company isn't big on that. It's not like we have hipaa, PII or pci information, but he has this background and, you know, sometimes you just can't shake who you are. So what he would really like is a system where and a lot of Ish, a lot of air quotes on this would be we open up a ticket to onboard somebody. It generates a bunch of parent tickets. Toby dietermann needs to go through the four or one K program, needs to have health insurance delivered to him and needs a laptop and needs a tablet. Three months later. Toby doesn't work out. Okay. Did you collect the tablet? Did you collect the laptop? Did you block his account, right? That sort of stuff? So he would, he kind of likes the thoroughness of templatized onboarding and offboarding and stuff, that brings, does that make sense? So we would probably need four or five licenses, total, two for me and Chris and then two for HR.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So it would be three separate emails that you're looking to manage.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  No, no, no, it would just be three separate tickets or sorry, not three separate tickets. It would be ideally like one ticket. I can flex on that, but, you know, just kind of one ticket to kick off the onboarding process. And then it would generate tasks, child tickets, whatever you want to call it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So we're primarily like a ticketing solution for email management, like customer service. So this sounds like you're looking for more of like a project management software? Yeah.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  Yeah, this is not all right. And I may have looked at your demo a little. You guys popped up. And if this is the wrong thing totally and I don't listen, you know, you're a sales Guy, you're not going to go to president's club off of us.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just based on what I'm hearing, it sounds like you looked at Monday com previously, like we wouldn't compete against them that's more project management.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  Yeah, the, this… would be, I think I'd be looking at your, this is what I think I clicked on your itsm suite, but maybe I'm wrong on that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, yeah, we do itsm like we provide ticket management for it teams, but we don't provide like the asset management features and things along those lines. Like it sounds like if you're looking at like a Monday. Com, it sounds like you're more of like looking for more of a project management type solution.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  Yeah. The irony is we're not looking at their PM solution. We're looking at the, they have like it's called the work or something like that.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  Workflow management is one thing they're service desks. So they have like a service desk and that's basically what I'm looking for.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Do you have like an it help desk email where these emails are getting funneled into? Yes.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  Yeah. So we would have, we would have an email. Ideally, we, what we would want is an email and a form and a landing page if worst case, I guess I'd be happy with just email only that's probably grab enough. And, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, cause we can help 100 percent with the ticket management perspective. Sean. So kind of taking a look at my screen here and are using Gmail or outlook today.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  Outlook. We're a Microsoft shop.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, let me pull up the outlook solution.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  I get it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we provide like the shared inbox management. So see like on the left hand side right here, yeah, I don't think this is what you'd be looking for to be honest.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  No, the more I'm looking at it, I think I clicked on itsm and didn't really pay attention and was like great. They can do it. And now that I'm looking at it, you're like a bolt on pack if I had an itsm solution, cause you would be able to handle the email better than the system itself.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. That's correct.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Cool. But it was great to meet you. Sean. I'll keep you posted as kind of the product develops like we are working into that more itsm type case, but, it was great to meet you. And I hope you have a good rest of your week.

Sean Geeleher (sgeeleher@centurycompanies.us):
  You too Cole. All right. Have a good weekend. Thanks bye.
