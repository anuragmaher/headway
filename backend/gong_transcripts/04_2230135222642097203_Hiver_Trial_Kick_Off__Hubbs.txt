================================================================================

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  hey, Jeevan, just got to reassign this to you.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just make me a host. Take care.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Thank you so much.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Matthew. Hi, can you hear me okay?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Hi. Yeah. Can you hear you?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hi, Matthew. How are you?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Doing today? The rest will follow. They will join us soon.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Brian, Frank, we'll give them a second. Sorry… hi.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Good afternoon. Thanks for jumping on. I know I'm not sure whether Brian's in yet, but Brian… I know spoke to my team member. Alex. I think couple of weeks ago, Alex was supposed to be here as well, but he's just unfortunately, had a little bit of an emergency, take him out of the office today this morning. So I'm stepped in. My name is Jeevan. I currently lead the sales team here at hiver.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Sorry, the connection was lost for a moment.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No worries. Can you hear me okay? Now? Yeah, no, I was just saying, the last time I think, we spoke with Brian and Brian met with my team member, Alex, who was supposed to be in today, but he's unfortunately had to step away for an emergency at home. So I've stepped in. My name is Jeevan. I've been with the company for over seven years. I currently lead the sales team. So I've helped a lot of our customers evaluate deploy transition. So, very equipped to sort of help you get started this afternoon and I'll probably be available for the next couple of calls as well.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay, great. I've also joined.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Thanks. Brian. Are we waiting for Frank as well?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yes, he's about to step in.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. In a moment. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Frank will step in, but he will just be here in this week.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Yeah. Thanks everyone for jumping on. Like I said, my name is Jeevan.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I want to set a quick agenda before we jump straight in and I want to make sure that we make use this time as productively as possible. So, Brian… just want to quickly summarize the conversation we had a couple of weeks ago, you had with Alex. I've got some notes over here. Currently, you help manage property rentals and maintenance across about 400 properties, and you've got a team using a shared Gmail inbox to manage incoming maintenance requests, complaints, work orders from your inspectors. You currently use another tool called fisma for generating work orders if I understand that correctly, but you are looking for a way to better manage the shared inbox where work orders and requirements come in and hiver sort of what it does is it helps add a… layer of functionality on top of Gmail, which can help you manage your inbox better without having your team learn a different software or go to a different place sort of like stay inside Gmail, but still have the tools to manage it better. So, the objective of the call today is to help you get started with an actual trial, of course, happy to answer questions, do a quick tour as we go. But that's what I've got, from my notes so far, Brian, anything that you want to add?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  No, I don't think we have anything to add. We have been in the meeting, all three of us have been in the meeting last two weeks ago.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  And based on that meeting, we wanted to start with implementing hiver into our.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Shared inbox.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  We want to set it up today so we can start working with it because it's now a quiet period in our office, sure. And so we can get the hang of it. And then after we get the hang of it, we can start using, more functions.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Of course, of course. So we start with the base.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  And.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  then.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  we.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  can keep building on it. Yeah, right… today. Yeah, that was my objective as well. So, what we'll do today is actually help you get started first and foremost with an instance of hiver, add the three of you maybe add a shared inbox. We also give you a sandbox that you can use to test it's. Got some fake emails which are not really, which are not real at all but that is just sort of an example for you to evaluate and play around and move things around if required. Yeah, we can also walk you through the admin controls and what the different workflows possible are, and we can help you explore that. But today is just for an overview on future calls. What we'll try to do is also like Brian you mentioned build on it, understand specific scenarios that you'd like to cover and we can definitely build on that as well.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay… perfect.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, let's jump straight in to start with, right? I mean, I will need one of you to share your screen. Whoever it is. It's fine. You can have as many admins, you can change controls later. But the first person, it's a very simple process. It's going to take us about 10 minutes and I'll walk you through it right now.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay. I will share my screen, okay?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  You can't do that, right? You can't do that. No, sometimes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  If it's asking you for permission, you might have to leave and come back.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Matthew pushed the wrong button. Jeevan, it is.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yes. Yeah. Just.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  A moment. He'll be back in a second. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  He is right. This meeting is being… share my screen.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So all we need access to, is on the new, just if you could open up a new tab. Yeah… from, my.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Personal email account.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's fine. That's perfect. Yeah. And I see you already have hiver installed. Have you had a trial that is run? Or you had a, you had a?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Well, before we had the meeting with Alex?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. No worries. We can, we can restore it.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. He said we could reset the trial period.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. I'm just going to.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just go on with it.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Because we already activated it before we had the meeting?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No worries. We'll restore it. I'm just what I'm just going to do if you give me two minutes, is I'm going to just go to sort of like clean, give us a clean slate so we can start from scratch. Yeah, because the previous account is still sort of under the suspended state. So just, I haven't installed it yet. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just go one minute.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We should be good to go.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Just switch.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Over to your just refresh your screen for a second… and then you should see… hiver no longer appear. Can you just that's fine. I did this. I just like sort of like, yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Disconnected it to.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Disconnected the previous one so that we can start a new one? Could you just like type, click on the extensions button in Chrome right above here? Yeah, that one? Yeah, just trying to see.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. It's still on. Yeah, it's still on. Okay. Can you just go back and refresh? Yeah, refresh your email again?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Oh, it's back.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's back. So now you can just click log into hiver.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And then it's going to just, yeah, you can just fill those details out. It's going to come straight to me. So, not shouldn't be an issue. It's yeah. So here, I was just going to say… we only thing that's required so that there's no remnants of the previous account. Matthew is to name it differently than the one the time we did before. So previously, I think you named it orders, right?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah, we can. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just, and… just, can you maybe just name, add another name in there? I'm just going to confirm in a second on what the previous name was. Okay. The previous name was orders, it was orders. Yeah, it was orders. Yeah. So now this should be fine. So this should be fine. You can click next.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. And with the customer service?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's fine. That's okay. You can just leave it at customer service. You can click next, and then you can just click connect email. So, is this orders like a separate mailbox? Yeah. So you,

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  know if there's a mailbox? Where.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  six people that's fine. Yeah, that's cool.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  It's not a main mailbox. It was.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we'll come back to that in a second.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Just take… email.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Maybe you might just need to remove the zero. Yeah. So if it's a standard email account, so, yeah, you just need to like log in with that. Yeah. And then I'm just going to ask you to log in with it.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Oh, before we log in, does something happen to the mailbox at the moment? Like when we have snooze mails or concept mails, if we connect it, they will be.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, is the team right now logging in directly to the mailbox and working out of there? Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  There are people logged in right now and working from into.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  The orders mailbox directly, right? No, the, this is not really the behavior. Yeah, the other mailbox, yeah. Yeah. So it's not going to impact them in any way. All of those things will continue to happen.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay. The basic functions of Gmail. They keep?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  On working, that will continue to, yeah. Okay.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Now, then I can connect the.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Oh,

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  am I still sharing my screen?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You are, but, yeah, you might have. Yeah. So just click on the sign in with the Packard Gmail account option. The first one because it's an actual regular Gmail account.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah, I'm only sharing the Google page. So I'm in another screen right now.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. You can just like complete that process. You just have to click continue.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  I'm going to continue to connect. No.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You can add… more later for sure. Yes. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay. So, you can.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Do this later. I will do the tour for you. So you can just click. We'll do this later at the bottom. So we'll do the tour together. Yeah. So the way this works gentlemen, is that Matthew? So the reason I asked the question earlier is that, are your team members? Are they just sharing passwords and logging directly into orders at hubbs? NL? Right? Yeah. And the reason I asked that was because with hiver, that is the only change that they'll have to make which is people don't need to share passwords and log into the orders mailbox together. They can stay in their individual inboxes and they will just see orders as a folder over there on the left. So, can you just like expand that? Yeah, just expand that for me. Perfect. So now, right there, if you expand it, you will see that the orders mailbox is right there… right? So it's going to take a second for all of these to sync. It'll. Take just a couple of minutes. But all of the emails that are sent to orders at hubbs NL, will come into that bare folder there right now. And this is going to come in for me and for all the other members of the mailbox as well. And once it comes in here, because we're in each individual account individually accessing that as a folder, we need features and tools to manage it properly. And that's what hiver is going to bring you. And we're going to be able to show that to you in exactly a couple of minutes for the time being, just to get a sense of what that looks like below the orders inbox, it might be ready, right? So, these are all the latest emails in your orders mailbox. We've just brought a few of them over so you can see what they look like. The idea here is that each of you will be able to see this list of emails. And I don't want to mess with the actual live mailbox. So just to give you an example of what that looks like, can you click on the demo inbox? Yeah. So this is what it eventually will look like, right? And can you open one of these emails?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So if you open these emails, you will be able to read that email, you will be able to reply. But on the right, you will have this side panel. Yeah. Now, this side panel, there's a lot of different things that we can do. And I don't want to go into each of them. But I'm going to give you an overview of the three main questions or things that it can help. Yeah, number one, first question that it answers is who is responsible for picking up this email on the team? Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  It's with a sign perfect. Right now, the.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Second, you add more people which I will show you in a second on how to do. The second you add more people, they will keep starting appearing here and either you can manually assign it to someone or like this or you can, we can also set up workflows where this assignment process is done automatically as the emails are coming in.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Is it also possible to select multiple meals to assign it to one?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Person? Absolutely. So you see the bulk action right there where you can select multiple emails and can you just click? Got it. So you can see that. Yeah. So once you click on it, yes. So you can select multiple emails and then you can assign them, but also, you can do other things that we will talk about in a second. Okay, great. Right. Okay. Now, what happened? Let's so can you just go into this email and assign this to yourself? Just as an example? Oh.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Sorry, because Frank.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Is leaving, what did you say? I missed the? No, no worries. So on the right, can you just as an example, assign this email to yourself? Yeah, perfect. Now, the second you assign this email to yourself, couple of changes happen, right? Number one, that activity that you just did is logged in timestamp. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. You assigned it to you. This happens on all actions across all team members. So if you are not at all involved in an email and you just happened to open it, you will see who's done what, on which email at what time right there? Yeah. Okay. Number one, number two is, can you just expand the side panel again for me on the left… previously? If you notice there were 19 emails or 20 emails in the unassigned section right now, the unassigned section does not have the email that you just assigned why? Because it's no longer unassigned. So where does it go for you? You will see all the emails that are currently assigned to you in the mind section right here?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay. Now.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  If it is assigned to someone else… you can click on the team section. And then what the team section gives you is, can you click on that again on the team or on the team section? Yeah. Another pop up is supposed to turn up. That might be because of the, just for the sake of this call, Matthew, would you be able to just switch the vertical split off? Sorry, the vertical split. I think it's sort of like running out of room.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Now, can you click on the team section? Oh, interesting. Can you just refresh your page for a sec?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Can it maybe be a thing that I'm the only user in this? No, no.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  There we go. This is what I was looking for, right? So there is another pop up on the left where all the names of the individual members are there. So, if I am assigned five emails, but I have called in sick today, those five emails are not going to be stuck with me. Someone else on the team, whoever is available can click on the team section, can click on my name on the left. See specifically all the emails that are assigned to me. They can see everyone. But if they want to pick one person, they can pick my name over there. They can see all the five emails assigned to me. And here's, the best part, I don't need to be cc'd or forwarded that email to see it. I can open it. I can see all the back and forth, all the history that has already been exchanged. So, if I need to cover for someone who's on a day off, I just need to step in and I have all the context and information in front of me and I can just reply. Okay, right? So, the mind section is great for individual team members because they don't have to worry about. Is that for me, is this not for me? Is this for someone else? That confusion? Is there, they go to the mind section, they see exactly what is under their purview, but they can also come to the team section and see what everyone else is up to.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Can I ask you a question about this?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yes, please, yes, please.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  The way we work at this moment is that we assign emails with a label which is perfect for Gmail. Until now. But after we reply to someone, we remove our label, sure. So that if a reply comes from the person who is emailing us, it doesn't necessarily has to be followed up by the one who replied.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Replied the first time. Yeah. How?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Does hiver works with this? Great? So, instead of.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Applying the label, you assign it to someone, right? Let's say, I'm the first reply person who's supposed to be replying. So you assign it to me. Okay? Now, what you can do is after replying, you can either ask your team to unassign themselves or there is an easy way to do this, right? Matthew, can you just open one of these emails? And when you can, you click reply for me?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Just reply. So at the bottom of there, do you see the send button, Matthew, next to the send button, there is a hiver send button. So one of the options in that hiver send button is you are able to change the status, right? So I'm going to talk about status next, which is coming in a second. But to answer your question, yeah, just click that drop down. Yes. So, Brian, if you notice there is an option called send close and unassign, right? Yeah. So if you don't automatically unassign themselves, and if a new reply comes in, it goes back to the unassigned section so that someone else can go in and pick it up. Great, but it will only be back.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  In the unassigned as soon as the reply, as soon as there is a reply. Yeah. Okay. Great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right now, let's talk about between the.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Blue send button and send and close. Sure. So, in the blue.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Send button. It just sends the email without making any changes to the hiver side panel. It just sends the email all the, if it's assigned to you, it will stay assigned to you. And I want to talk quickly, talk about the status, right? So that will make a lot of sense. So, hiver allows gives you a status to know whether something is pending open or completed… right? So each email, Matthew, on the right next to your name there, you will see a status section over there. So whenever an email comes in by default, it comes in as open now from open, you can change it to pending or closed based on the progress. Right now. I will tell you how, why, this is all going to come together, right? Why not email comes in. It, it'll come in as open, right? Let's say email comes in. It's an open. It gets assigned to me. I mark, I reply to that email and I mark it as send close and unassigned. So what happens? Two things happen. One, the status changes from open to closed, and the assignment gets removed. So my name is no longer in the assignment. It becomes unassigned. Again. Now, what happens when a new reply comes in? Even if this is a new reply that came in hiver will detect that a new reply has come in and will automatically change the status from closed back to open or even if it was pending by the way somewhere in the middle, even if it wasn't pending and a new reply comes in, it'll change it back to open. Okay. Right now, the way this ties in, right? The way hiver makes it easy for your team to know whether what is open, what is not open? Is, can you just exit the team section? For me on the left, there is a small little there's a small. Yeah, perfect. Yes. Now, once you exit this, right, you are going to be noticing a couple of, so the unassigned mine and team sections on the left, these three sections by default only show you all the emails that are currently open. So unassigned will show you all the emails that are open and unassigned. Mine will show you all your open emails and the team will show you all of the team's open emails. So what happens when you change something from open? It doesn't disappear Matthew, can you click on all views for me? There's? A specific folder over there on the left for pending and closed. So it'll just go to that folder. And if a reply comes in, it'll leave that folder and come back to unassigned. Or come back to mine automatically. Okay. It's more like to keep it clean, archive. Yeah, archiving, an email closed is archiving, exactly perfect. Same… if it comes back, a new reply comes back, it automatically comes back to open. Yeah, same as archives. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Right. And if you also don't want to come in here and see each of these sections, you can just hit the, there is a star button next to pending. So if you hit the star button, it adds it to the favorites. So it'll come to your home page. Oh, yeah. Okay. Cool. So while you are here, let's say these are the default views that hiver creates for you guys. You can create a custom, your versions of these views as well. Let's say, I, yeah, you want to, you can create a view and you can select what emails should be visible in that particular view and then you can save it. So all of these will can help you do, but these are ways in which you can. So, for example, you want to see all of Matthew, your emails that are currently open and pending with a particular tag. Okay, right. So you can filter. This is, these are filters that you can create for yourself or for the team. And then you can save these filters as views.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We'll come to the aips in a second. Yeah, we'll come to the aips in a second. But any questions so far? No, at this moment, no. Awesome. Okay. So we spoke about, the assignments, we spoke about the statuses. Those are the two main aspects. The third biggest aspect I would say is the organization piece. So let me just show you what that looks like. Can you just exit out of the team section? Again? Matthew on the left? Yeah… the little cross here below all views there, you will see something called tags. So tags are really helpful because these are like Gmail labels that you can search for that you can filter through. And all that. So, instead of using these labels for assignments because there's already something for assignments, you can use this for folders or categories. So if you've got for example complaints, you can create a tag for complaints. If you've got a tag, if you've got one for… work orders, you can create a tag for work orders. So at the end of the week, what is the benefit of using these? The benefit of using these is that at the end of the week, if you want to come in and click on your complaints tag, it will show you all of the unresolved complaints. First, like you see on top, there is an unresolved tag. And then next to it, you will see all conversations. So if you want to find older conversations, you can go find here as well. Okay. So that is also connected with, the analytics exactly. So then you can see how many… complaints you got, how many work orders you got, how long did you take to respond to complaints? How long did you take to resolve complaints? Yeah. Okay. Right. Nice. So now you've got all of these aspects, couple of, very interesting things that you can add. So these are what your team is going to do day to day, right? And I'll come to the reply part in a second because that also could be very helpful. But before that, a couple of quick things that you can add very easily Matthew to your orders mailbox is if you feel like your team is taking too long to reply to emails if at all… there is a way for you to set a due date on every single email using an SLA. So we can show you how to do that in the admin panel. But what that does is in the, in practice, the email in front of you this, how do I change my delivery, email address at the beginning of that month? Do you see a gray color badge called RT? Yeah. Can you just like, yeah, put your, if you put your mouse over, it. Will actually hope it'll open and tell you that it is resolution is due by this date tomorrow, okay? Right? So, this is based on the rule that you can set up that says, hey, if an email comes in by a maximum of 24 hours, it needs to get a reply.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. And,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  you can set a due date for that. And if it doesn't get a reply within those 24 hours.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  What?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hiver will do is.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  it will.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Change color.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So, this red?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Gray color badge will change color to red, right?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  that, when you are looking at 20 emails?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  If 18?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Of them have gray badges, which means that they have time to reply, but two of them will have red badges.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Which.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  means that they have, the time has been run out. So, if you're the supervisor you are looking at this, you can click on it, quickly, see why the delay, see what's happening and get people to action it quickly… right? So that is something we can help you set up.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Next.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  to that gray badge?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Do you see a Smiley? So this is.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Our AI one.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Of our.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  things that our AI does?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So, the most.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Fundamental thing that our AI does is it tries to eliminate… as many tasks as additional steps as required for you, right? So, one of the things that it does to eliminate additional steps?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Is by.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  assigning a sentiment to every email?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So, if you've got.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  A frustrated client somewhere in your email, you're looking at 30 emails, but one of them is from a frustrated client who's not having a good experience.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Instead of you.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Stumbling on it.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Hiver will.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Automatically detect from the tone of the email that this is a frustrated client and will assign a Smiley face to it.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So, in this.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Case, it is neutral when it's happy, it will be in green, but when it's frustrated, it will be in red and this happens in real time.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  And do you also know if the Dutch language is supported?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We have had some success with German and Spanish in the last couple of months, we are happy to help you work with it and see whether we can make it work fluently for Dutch as well, but you can definitely switch it on and try it out.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  I think Alex has sent us an email in which he confirmed… that the AI. Yeah, it's the same, the text, the summary that is supported by AI co, pilot supports Dutch. Yeah, the co.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Pilot should support it at the end of the day. Guys. Look, we use the underlying AI that's doing all of this is.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Chatgpd. Yeah. Okay. And it's supported in French.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's gpt V. So we use the latest gpt from openai, who's also a customer of hiver's by the way they use hiver in a few. So it's both ways. But, yeah. So I think that's why we are quite confident that we can make this work.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah, pretty cool. Yeah, we work with chatgpd as well. And the Dutch language is supported in French. There might be.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Some misses, but from what I understand, they're getting better all the time. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  They're getting better all the time. Okay?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, I think this is specifically what I want to cover couple of just last couple of pieces. One is you can set up the co pilot to help you reply to emails which I'll show you in a second, but without the co pilot, if you have some very standard responses that you want to save as templates, not just for one person but for the team, hiver helps you create templates for emails as well. Can you exit out of the, oh, can you open this email?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, if you click reply again?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Down. So at the.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  bottom below the send option, do you see a few buttons? One?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  The third?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Button there is called email templates. So.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  This is how you can.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Use it and select it. Each person can do it now if you want to create, because you haven't created one, if you want to create one.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Just click on create.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Email template. So this is part of your screen, you can just click, create template. It's a simple as typing out an email. But once you type it out once and you save, it gets saved for everybody. And,

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  you can also add.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Attachments to it as well if required. Okay?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  That… is nice, right? Yeah… nice.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, you can definitely set this up and I know we're coming up on time, so I want to quickly jump into the admin panel to show you a couple of things. Can you just exit out of this for me? No?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Today? Admin panel? Yeah. So just exit.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just exit out of this demo inbox first.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Perfect. That's fine. That's.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  okay. That's okay. We got, we got to the right place. So a couple of things, to look at here. First things first, if you want to add more people or control their access for a thing, you want to click on users and roles on the far left, right? So… Brian, you're here, you can change Brian to admin, maybe, yeah, perfect.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  And you can have as many.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Admins as well. And there's also two other roles in the middle between just a regular member and admin. There's a supervisor and a mailbox admin. If you want to see what each of them can do, you can just click on roles there on the left. Perfect. And there is an explanation for each of them. And if you click on their roles, it actually gives you a very specific role by role access on what each person can do, what each person cannot do.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Nice.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  That's one. Secondly, if you want to start exploring the AI, the main AI folder is the, is there on the left there, right? So this is where you can set up a sentiment that we spoke about.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  You can also.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Ask hiver to do tagging… and if you click on co pilot, you can start.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  The second.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Tab over there on top, you can start teaching it what you wanted to learn from, and it will be able to start composing emails from, yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  In the grammatonic style. Okay? Yes.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Thank you.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  If I, the changes… I make here with the co pilot, it's in… the main mailbox account, right? So that what I… yeah, configure here, it will be for every user within the, yes, within the team on the, you can.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Actually choose that much. It's on the top, right? If you see, there's a drop down.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then you can just like choose your mailbox. And then now all the changes you make here will be for that mailbox. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Can you?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Explain me something, because at this moment, I only see the demo inbox and the behavior box. But what about Matthew's personal inbox?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Great.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So, I think.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  that might be because you might have to add, so that's a great point brand. Thank you. So, can you click on the shared inboxes for me on the left Matthew?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  You.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  can notice there is demo inbox and the orders inbox right here.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right? So, if you click on these, so you will select, each mailbox can have its own unique set of users. Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay. So these are the two.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Participants for the bear inbox. And so if you have multiple inboxes, and if you've got let's say 10 people, you can choose who gets access to what everyone does not have to see everything, you can control who is a participant of which mailbox, yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And your own mailbox?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Will be private, your mailbox is.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Always private. You are just a participant in hiver, your actual mailbox has no con, no connection to this.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  A lot of really nice features here as well. Matthew, you can look, we can help you look at custom fields and everything in future calls. But just in the interest of time, the one piece I wanted to talk to you about is two things. One is we spoke about the gray banner, which tells you how long the due date is, that can be configured with the SLA at the bottom, right?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  that is when you can choose to define those rules… very, yeah, you can set rules like if an email comes in and a first response is not done within, what time? So this is where you can set those rules and.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  What is really?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Interesting on top of all of this is?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Where you can set up?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Your, this, that's your workflow builder method and the automations is where we've got a lot of different options available to you. If you can click on create automation… it's a very simple workflow builder. But the options are very big, right? So.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  You can say.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  When a conversation comes in, if this condition is met?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Then take this action right now.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It could be something as simple as an email coming in?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  And it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  has it has got these words, in the subject line or these words in the body? And you want to assign it to this person or you can do, hey, I want to add this tag and when I add this tag, I want these steps to be taken. So, a lot of different options here, something for you to explore and we'll help you definitely explore it. And then in future.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Course. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Nice, right? There are only 15 minutes left. I would like to ask you another question, sure, because in the meantime, I have been installing the hiver plugin as well to Chrome. Sure. And at this moment, I only see two emails in the other side, how… in?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Which mailbox? Yeah.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Be here? Okay?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And can you just,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  it takes a few minutes to sync across to everybody?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  So, can you just click.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  on bear for me?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  There's 13 emails.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Here. Yeah. So, Brad, if you're only seeing two for now, it might take just a few more minutes for it to catch up.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  If you don't.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  see it the same, what, whatever Matthew's seeing, you're supposed to see exactly what Matthew's seeing. And if you're not seeing that, you can always let us know, just reply to Alex or myself on email or this actually brings me to the main piece that I wanted to bring up for both you, Matthew, for you, Brian, and for anybody else who joins hiver, you?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Have access.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  To 24 seven non stop tech support with our team. The way you can access them is very easily via chat from this screen itself. Can you just click on that hiver settings button on the top, right? Matt?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Do you?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  See instant chat support the second option from the bottom? Yeah. So.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Any questions?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Anything that you need anything that you're not seeing Brian, you can just let my team know and they'll be able to take a look. I will also.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Keep an inc, make sure that it is syncing properly on my end and I.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  will post it. Yeah, because at this moment, the inbox is not very full. It just has 13… conversations. So it's not so many. So… it would be a good time. I think to synchronize.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I'm just give me one second. I'm just going to raise a request to count.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it should catch up in a couple of minutes.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. I think you've changed something because… they're showing now and also my demo inbox is now showing some emails. Yeah. So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Basically because you've joined a few minutes after Matthew, it's just sort of like creating and making all the connections on the background. So that usually sort of like catches up and is the same level of Matthew and then in the next couple of minutes.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. And what about our previous emails? The one we have in our archive?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. So if you want to bring them over to hiver, just so that you are, everyone is just has access to it in their own inbox and you?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Can search and see the history?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Review and you see history. We are definitely able to bring those in for you. It is at no additional cost but it is that we only do it at the time if and when you decide to move forward, with a full.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Subscription and yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And that's only because we don't want to move your emails around before this is going to be long term. It's not, there's no additional cost to it, but we just like sort of offer the option for more paid customers.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah, of course. No problem. Once the trial.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Is done and let's say everything goes well and, we decide how to take this forward. We will definitely be able to bring in your older emails.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay, great. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Any other questions?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  For me? Not at the moment. No, I think it's a matter of start working with it and figuring stuff out. Sure. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We're happy to help you do that every step of the way, even if you want to have a quick presentation for the other team members so that they can get up to speed before they get added to hiver. Let us know. We can happy to set that up. But when do you think would be a good time for us to circle back just to see where things are and to continue to build and answer questions and help you?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  The trial is?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Typically for a week?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay. And then I think we should recap next week on Monday, same time?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  On Monday should work. Yes, because.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Matthew and I will be starting to work with it for now, but our office is closed on the New Year's Day and also the day before. So, okay, no.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Worries. Yeah, similar. Same here. Yeah, we can definitely catch up on money and here's what I'll do right? Just to make sure that we've got some. We're.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  not losing.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Time to the new years and the holidays. I will extend your trial out till the end of next week. So you've got like good number of few days to test this out. We just to make sure that you've got enough time to actually make this happen?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay. Should we also do a recap on Monday or should we do it before after the time after the trial? No?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We can do a recap on Monday just to see where things are. And of course, yeah, if you want to continue setting up and go through some SLA's automations, we can definitely use that time.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  To do it. Yeah. Okay. Great. Let's plan for Monday, the fifth of January around also at three o'clock.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  yeah, perfect. That's that sounds good. I will just send that invite in. I've just sent that across to you. And yeah, if you, if you've got any other, and I've also extended your trial till the end of the next week. So, yeah, we think we should be good to go. Okay?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Matthew, can you open the spam folder at this moment at this moment? Because in my spam folder, there are several emails, my spam, okay, that.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Might have been before however or not related to our brand because typically, the reason I'm saying that is we don't control spam at all. We leave that to Google to control. Yeah. But if.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  I'm now in the spam section of Google and there are four delivery status notifications failures about the mail that couldn't be delivered to Matthew, and then the plus sign hyperdemo at hops? NL?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  There's a spam. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I don't really know why it is in my email. It's in my personal spam. So in your personal spam?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, Matthew, can you just go to, yeah, your personal spam and see?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  I.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  don't second, where is my spam box? Yeah, just click on up under highway. Just click on more there spam there. Yeah… emails. Just click that. That's fine. Don't worry about that because, what happens here, Brian is we create a, not a real email address for the demo inbox. And that email address is what is saying that the email is not being able to deliver to. Don't. Worry about this. This, is, this is fine.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  And we can… how long does the demo inbox stage? As long as we are having the demo? Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, as long as you're in the demo, typically, when you want to move forward with a subscription, it gets removed automatically, but you can remove it earlier as well. You can just go to the admin panel and delete it earlier if you want to.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay. But what would you recommend for us to try out hybrid? Should we just work with it in our behavior mailbox? Or should we work with the demo inbox to start with? So my recommendation.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Is the second the entire team, whoever is going to be using their orders or whatever? The second they are a part of hiver, and they are also using hiver at that stage. I would definitely say you can start working out of hiver full time with the main inbox and we can see what improvements we can keep making until that time. I would recommend just using the demo inbox to play around to get a feel for it. The only reason I'm saying this, and my only recommendation is that I would really recommend certain people within hiver, certain people outside the hiver should not be working on the same emails because it always leads to some confusion. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Right. So that's the only thing I will ask to avoid once everyone is working in one system, then you can definitely continue using hiver fully.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah, I think no food questions, your honor. Perfect. If.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  there are any questions, feel free to let us know and we'll chat again next Monday to see where we are, okay?

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Great. Thank you for your time. It was really helpful and I'm excited to start working with it and, yeah, speak.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  To you next week. Yeah, just keep us posted and we're here to help even.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  During this, and in the meantime, we can use the 24 seven chat support.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Or you can even email Alex and I, and we'll be right there to help you.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay, great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Thanks.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Thank you for your time. You have a nice day. We are going to the evening already, yeah?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I hope it's a good day and good week and we'll catch you.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Soon. Okay. Thank you.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Thanks so much.

Matthew De Kruijk (matthew@hubbs.nl):
  Okay. Bye.
