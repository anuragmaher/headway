Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi Ashok.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Hi, Ekta. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you. How are you?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  I'm doing great. Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Shall we get started or expecting more people to join in as well? I saw some folks accepting the invite. I think Urmila?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah, Urmila, actually, she is in a client meet right now, so she is not available, so we can start, but I wish to record this call if you don't mind.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's already getting recorded if you want. I can share it or you already have your AI assistant here. So I think you'll get the notes after this.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah, notes, I'll get it, but recording is also required. I'll share it. Okay, fine. We can start.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Done great. Then. Ashok.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Thank you for scheduling this with us today. I'll be helping you with the evaluation and making sure that it aligns with what you're looking for. So before anything, I would just want to understand, you know, your current workflow and what exactly you're trying to achieve. And then I'll be in a position to sort of show you what we have and how that aligns with your requirements.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. Fine. So basically, like we do manpower outsourcing, okay? For the GCC countries. So our head office is in Dubai and we do have a branch office in India, that is bangalore, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Saudi. Arabia. So for now, actually we are looking for the ticketing system, okay, which we are looking for Saudi Arabia process, and which we are operating from India. Okay. So in case, if you see, we have around 2000 associates working with our client location. Okay? We usually receive the emails from employees clients or account managers. But currently, we are working in outlook. Okay, we don't have any ticketing system. So we wanted to explore how ticketing system works and how we can able to monitor the slas and the team performance also through AI automation. So if we have any knowledge management, it will be a great. Okay. So in the past, actually I have moved from the uae team to ksa team. Okay? So earlier, I have worked around nine years in the uae team. And there we worked in Freshdesk as a ticketing, and currently they were using Alina AI. Okay. So we do manage the whatsapp chatbot ticketing tools, surveys, analytics dashboards. So everything we have it in there. So for currently coming to the ksa part, currently, we are receiving the… employee request through Monday. Com. Hope you are aware about the Monday com platform where we are receiving the employee request and behalf of employees. Sometimes account managers also raise the request. So through that the employees will respond it over the email. Yeah, this is the overview.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So this is only for the ksa team that you're currently looking for. So this region that you are focusing on, right?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So for the other team for the uae, are they still using Freshdesk and Alina AI to manage the entire workflow?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Freshdesk. They actually earlier, they were using Freshdesk. Now, we changed from Freshdesk to Alina AI. They are using it too.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. But I think Alina AI is not a ticketing software, right? Or is it?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  It's a ticketing, it's actually, like we have certain things like we do send the anps surveys, we have views to send like exit interviews through qualtrics. Earlier, we were using qualtrics, and for ticketing, we were using separately as a Freshdesk. So here in Alina, like single under single umbrella, we have all the choice. We can do the surveys, ticketing tool, we have whatsapp chatbot also. So everything it comes under one umbrella in Alina. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So since you're already using Alina for this team, why not extend it for ksa market as well and use the same tool across all the regions?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  We are actually thinking about it, but before that, because we wanted to explore something more. Okay? So what else like new features if anything is there and which can able to rectify our internal issue right now? So if you see how ksa team is working in a sense, as I said, they are receiving all the emails in outlook. So the challenge here is they have ksa operations at taskoutsourcing. Com. Okay. This is the email id and they are receiving all sort of queries in one single inbox. Yeah. Okay. But in uae, if you see, we have different email ids for onboarding. It is like joining a task outsourcing. And for renewal, we have the renewal, a task outsourcing for request. It is requested like different for each request. It's a different email ids. Okay. So, but here it is a single email id where team is struggling hard to segregate the emails and everybody like 19 people are looking into the same inbox and they are working on it. So we wanted to reduce this because same emails again and 19 people will read it out, right? So the product he has is going, I mean.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, got it. And at this point, how many people do we have who are managing this inbox?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Right now, I can say as 19?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  One nine, right? Yeah. Also. And could you also elaborate a bit about your role? I know that you spoke about how you are now managing the ksa business. So, are you the one who's heading this team as well? Who is responsible?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah. I'm the operation manager here.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. You're the operations manager understood. Yeah, I think, you know, in terms of managing the day to day workflow, and this particular inbox, you could definitely use something which can give you more streamlined way of managing all the emails here, probably bucket them into different kinds of queries that you're receiving since you only have one email address here. This is the common one. And then from there, you would be able to get more analytics. You can create certain slas, how much time each agent should be taking in terms of replying to these emails and things like that. So, I think for that a ticketing tool could definitely help you in terms of automating these things. Let me just show you quickly as to, you know, how that looks like and you could then let me know if this is something that resonates or helps you. Let me just share my screen. I hope you can see it.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yes, yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, Asha, the outlook, you know, that you're currently using within hiver, the interface is going to be a lot similar to what you have in outlook, so that it's easier for the team to also get accustomed to using this tool. And the learning curve is also not that steep now to just let you know hiver works on this URL called app, hiverhq. Com. And this is where you'll be logging in order to start using hiver. Okay. Just kicked me out. Let me just sign in again. Just give me a second yep.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Perfect. Here. I have it back. So as you can see, in order to work out of this shared mailbox, you'll be logging in or using this URL app, hiverhq. Com. Everybody will have their outlook credentials through which they'll be logging into this. Once they do that, we will create the shared mailbox associated with your ksa email address. So as you can see, I have different shared mailboxes that I am part of today in my company. Likewise, we will create one for this generic email address that you want to manage. And we will add all 19 individuals into this so that everybody can log into this and then manage this together. Now, since this is a separate platform, we do have an option to also manage our personal inbox, so that you don't have to go back and forth into handling both, so that you can still manage your personal inbox as well as the shared mailbox, right? So now, once let's let me take an example of the support inbox here. Let's say this is the inbox that you have or let's say operations. This is how your workflow will get defined. Now, wherein all the new emails will come into the unassigned section. This will say that, okay, these are the emails that nobody has started working on yet. And you can easily understand that, okay, these are the emails that we have to pick. Now, once these emails are in an assigned section and you pick any of these from the right section, you can now give the ownership as to who needs to work on it. So let's say you have different kinds of emails coming in. You have specific person working on specific kind of email. We can automate this process as well, right? So we don't have to always manually assign tickets to each other. But from the admin panel, you can actually go ahead and create any automation as per your workflow. And it becomes rather easy for you and everyone to be able to then automatically assign those emails based on certain keywords in the subject or anything that you are interested in. So that the assignment part becomes a lot easier.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Can I ask a question here?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Please.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. So when coming to the automation, so whatever the emails it comes in. So, if you see here in ksa or in uae, so the team is working based on the client. Okay? So we have assigned certain clients to the certain people. So how that works here?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can absolutely create that automation. So we can, we create, let's say, I am handling you know, five clients. You just put their, you know, domains here. Let's say Amazon is one, flipkart is one. And then like that, and we can assign that to the individual who is working on all these with these clients. And we can replicate this for all other individuals. So this is going to be a one time activity for us, which of course, we can help you doing it. Do you have any rough number as to, per agent or per person, how many accounts they're handling at a point?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Around 10?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many individuals we are looking at?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Individuals here around 19?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So across 19 people will be creating this automation to assign respective accounts that they are working on. So that those automations get triggered. Yeah, we can definitely achieve that. So, I.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  don't know how things will work here because client names we are giving it. It is not like I employees will. So employees will, sometimes what happens, they will drop an email to account manager and account manager will forward it to us. Okay. Will the system pick the keywords which is in the mail body, the client name, and assign it by themselves?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You can. We can do that as well. So see if the client is not directly writing to this email address, rather it's first getting assigned or is written to account manager and account manager is then forwarding. Then we can also do this. Let's say in that case, we will see that if it's coming from, we'll put the account manager's email address here directly so that if any email comes from the account manager, it gets assigned to that person itself. Is it the same person? Like the account manager or account manager is not going to be part of this inbox.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  No, they are not part of this inbox because even if you are saying like account manager names, email ids, if we are giving it can be assigned to the particular person, but same account manager handles multiple clients. So different.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  They handle multiple clients. But in your team, let's say it might be happening that I am not handling the same number of clients that the account manager is handling.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So for that, I think we'll not do this. Rather. What we will do is we will put it in the subject. So will there be any mention of this client in the subject or the body of the email?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Body of the email? Yeah, may or may not. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So then we'll have to see if you know the same, you know, keywords are there in the body. We can also say object just to be more accurate, and then make sure that these also are conditions that we add here. So not just email, but if these names are there in the body or subject, you know, we assign this to this person.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Does this help?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So yeah, I think these are the automations that you can create to make sure that we are automatically routing these emails to the right person. And then once you do that, they will be seeing all the emails assigned to anyone in the mind section. So that I know that currently, I have one open ticket that I need to work on. And under team section, we can still see across all individual individuals as to how these tickets are distributed so that we maintain full transparency and also the workload distribution and make sure that if Rakesh has 13 tickets, if I need to jump in here, reassign it to myself, I can easily do it because any activity that you perform in hiver, everything gets recorded. So at all times, everyone knows as to what changes we are making… or if I want to, you know, give him a quick note here, right? I can do that as well so that to avoid forwarding emails or marking each other in CC. So we can easily sort of collaborate or share internal notes in this section right here.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So this is something we can do. And then while you're working on any email, there are a couple of things here as well, right? Like how you can use the email templates, so you can actually load the templates in here in the template section, so that for repetitive sort of emails that you keep receiving, you have some responses of some auto responses that you can send in order to avoid, you know, the manual work. Apart from this, you can also use hiver, co pilot, AI co pilot that we have, which becomes your personal repository or an AI agent, wherein you can put all the information in the backend on which you want AI to train itself on. And accordingly, you can ask it to draft a reply for you based on the email that has come in or you can ask any question to bring more efficiency while you're working on these tickets.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right. This is something you can do. And of course, once I have my response, I can just send this and mark this closed so that I know that I've worked on this ticket and all the closed tickets, you will see in a designated section called closed, which will contain all the tickets that we have already worked upon. And if any reply comes on any closed or pending ones, they will come back into your mind section so that you don't have to keep checking these.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. So once the ticket is closed, is it possible to reply from the closed section itself or I have to change the status?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no. You can always reply from here. The status will anyway change itself to open if you're replying. And if you want to close it again, you can just close it.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. So these statuses, it is only three statuses or can we add more status?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can add more through a custom field here. Like these email priority email type are the custom fields which are not by default in hiver, the three status that you see open pending closed. This is going to remain as it is. Would you mind sharing? Like what other status you would want to have apart from these three?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Apart from those? So if we are currently, we are maintaining Monday com. Okay. I'll just, I'll share my screen so that you will have… ideal,

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Can you able to see my screen? I?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can. Yes.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. So here, if you see, so this is the Monday com platform, it looks like. Okay. So, E, Kama renewals, the team maintains these many status. Okay. So awaiting renewal in progress, stuck active. Okay. So if I see awaiting renewal under awaiting renewal. So these are the things which goes… because this is like the access we have given to the account management team, so that they will be knowing each and every employee, what is the current status? Okay? So this is the employee request lobby. So here, whenever employee is raising any request, this is how it sits, what type of query they have raised it, and who is working? Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So this is for your, you know, your work management, Monday. Com is sort of you're using it as a project management tool, right? When you're replying? Yeah, when you're responding to the emails, do you still want to? I mean you can have these status, right? In high words. So to answer your question, it is possible, you can have it, but I'm just curious, you know, in terms of since these are the emails that you will sort of be working on, back and forth, right? These are more to answer to these emails that are coming in. So that's why we have open pending closed. So that at a time, you know, that this one is open, this is pending which is awaiting approval and this is already closed. I have already worked on now for the Monday com for the app, of course, you can connect it with hiver. We have a native integration with Monday. So against each email, you will be able to see all the information of that record. And if you need to make changes there in the Monday accordingly on behalf of the email, you can do that. So, but if you want to still have those status, you know, similar to what you have in Monday, you can create that custom field, right? So in the admin panel, if you go into the operations, you can create custom fields as per what you want. So here you can call it as status.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Oh, sorry.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Status. And then you can put in progress or anything that you just.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  showed, but we can create, okay, you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can create it, but it is that my recommendation would be to first see if it is useful because since these are the emails that you're working on and not on a particular project or for a particular employee or a candidate. So here you could have these status. And then in the Monday, you can have those status based on the entire journey of that candidate, right? That you're handling at a time. So it's up to you but you can have both.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. So since you have said like even Monday com integration, we can able to do it. So can you tell me like because as of now any, which was you saw we are receiving like people are used to it working in Monday. Com like employee will get a link. Okay? Whenever employee joins our organization, employee will get a link to rise all their request. So for certain period of time, we wanted to keep still Monday com like till we train the employees to use this platform hiver platform. So will that be possible? Whatever we are receiving in Monday? Com, will that be converted here as a ticket? Will that be possible?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, are you looking for like a replacement for Monday com or are you going to continue using that along with replacement?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Replacement also?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. If you are looking at that just to clarify so that there is no confusion, hiver is not going to be working as a project management tool. So it will strictly be only helping you with the email management as a ticketing software, right? So just keep that in mind and in terms of the link, so you are saying that candidates can write to the email address or they have a customer portal or some sort of a candidate portal through which they raise request?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah, the Monday com only. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So do you want to keep that as it is, or want to replicate that in hiver?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  We are trying to, because that is what, because if we are getting into the new system, we cannot immediately stop, right? We cannot say employees stop using Monday. Com and moving forward. You have to send an email to this, right? Because there is a certain forms. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  How does it happen? So, for candidates, do they also have login to Monday com to see the progress?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah. One second. So there is a form. Okay. We have a form where employee can fill and share the request. So if you see here, there is a form.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. So this is an employee request form. So in case, if employee is clicking that link, employee has to fill their name and passport details, then company name, then phone number. So, in case, if employee is already joined, so here is the request, what, whether they are looking for any document or any sort of queries, they have to choose this option, then submit it once they submit, then it will come here… the main page.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is this like, is this the candidate portal that you are seeing showing me?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  No, this is our internal. So does.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Candidate.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  But for candidate, this is what it looks like.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Candidate only see the form, right? They don't see after.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  that, what is happening? No, no, no, they will not.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you only need a form to be connected with hiver? So that you can share that with your candidates and those forms. Once they fill it, they come in the form of email?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Exactly. So this is what we want. So, will that be possible? Because not only that we are using sap system, also this sap success factor?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  So, even that integration also required, for example, why I'm asking success factor integration? Because in case, if employee is asking for payslips or something. So, do you have a bot, the chatbot?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we do have that.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah. So in case, for example, if a bot is already in picture chatbot. So, in case, if employee is asking a payslips bot can go to that particular employee file in the sap system and share the payslip.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's not that advanced at this point, the chatbot that we have.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. How actually functions in chatbot? Well, you can explain me later also as you are doing this. So, I'm okay with that. Anything? No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's fine. In terms of the chatbot, are you looking, where do you want to place this chatbot… in success factor ets that you're using or?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Currently, we do have a chatbot. So it is like a contact number we used to provide. So it is integrated with the sap system. So, in case, if employee is looking for any personal information, any data change, I mean, any passport number, update, anything. So employee can request and bot, will, we will get the request, okay, notifications, we will receive it. So in case, if employee is asking for the payslip bot will give the payslip.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  From where from?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Sap success factor?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And for the, or for the candidate, where are they raising this?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Through whatsapp?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So they message, oh, okay. Okay. So you have whatsapp bot also?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. That is not going to be available with hygo at this point, at least. Okay.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  So, it is completely about only the emailing? Yeah, for.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  The email chat, why? I wanted to understand this? Because we do have live chat, but I did understand that. I do not think it has anything to do with the live chat part. You are looking for more of a chat bot who can answer certain questions?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Right, right. Right. Because we have a knowledge management. So in case, if we are saving all our like faqs in the knowledge management, then Ida based on employee, ask the Ida will respond, the chat bot will respond.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah, I understood.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  We basically wanted to reduce the number of ticket also like, Certain questions the employee will keep asking. So we do not want it to repeatedly answer the same, right? So that is the reason we wanted to bring that. Can Ida respond from the knowledge management?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Understood. I mean hiver also has a higher knowledge source or knowledge base that you can create, which you can feed into hiver AI that I showed you for the ask AI option. But for the chat, I wouldn't have it at this point in terms of the forms that you mentioned Asha, like since it's connected with outlook for the Gmail. Of course, you could have a Google form instead of this, right? And currently, we don't have customer portal. Also in outlook, we do have it in Gmail. Is that a must have for you? Like, is it something that you need to absolutely have?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah, because that is what, because employees are used to it now. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And also, you're getting a lot of information on that. So it will be difficult to get it on email. It will become very difficult.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Because in the email, it is very difficult like they will write the entire story of one particular requirement, you know that, right? Yeah. So forms is like very specific like we know for, in order to provide any letter or something, we know what details required from the associate. So only that employee will fill it. So it will be very crisp and clear for us to action instead of reading the like five line or six line emails.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. Anyway, check it out and let me know. Yeah, you can proceed. Sorry to interrupt because later I'll miss it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, that's fine. I'm glad that you're asking these questions because only then it makes sense. It has to align with what you're looking for, right? Customer portal thing. I will check internally whether there is a way to create form and connect it with the shared mailbox email address. And if that is done, then I think it will be easier for you to then, you know, redirect those forms in here. And then the rest of the process will remain the same. So we can do that for sure. Apart from it. I think this would be the basic workflow that I have just showed you. You will handle these tickets here and have all those. I think SLA is something which was missing. SLA is something that we can set up as well on the backend so that we know in the analytics part, if you want to have those metrics and the check in terms of how we are handling these tickets, we can then go ahead and sort of, you know, look at the workload distribution, the average performance of each member with part of it. So you can get all these analytics as well. So this would be the basic workflow in terms of, you know, what all you'll be seeing here.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. So I'm going back to the same, what you told before the ticket assignment, you have showed here, right? Assigned to me a finance or something. So here, like whoever is part of this, like I said, like around 19 people. So even all the 19 people will come to know like what others inbox?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So in the team section, you can see across everyone who is handling what. Okay. So what is assigned to, who like you can all have that transparency.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Is.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  it okay with you or you want to keep it confidential?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  So that also we can make it, right? It's possible.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no, that's not.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Possible. Not possible. Or everybody will see, yeah, anyway, even now, also they are, they can able to see each other?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And in any shared inbox or any shared scenario, the whole idea is to be able to collaborate, better, right? So it's more, we are creating it because it's shared between all individuals so that it becomes easy for everyone to then, you know, work on these emails.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. We can create a category, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can create categories through tags.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Tags will help you bucketing your emails into different categories, so you can create tags, right? And then apply those tags on emails so that to bifurcate them into different categories.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  So we can pull out the report also. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that is possible.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Any escalation metric on the SLF part, if they have not closed the ticket in one hour, the escalation should go.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can do that. We can set up that automation actually here wherein we say that, you know, if the time passed and there is no external reply received or there is status which is currently let's say in open and it's open for let's say for… past one hour, then you know, you should get a notification to either the management, anyone, or the manager and send an email as well that this has been missed. You can use the same template. So this is something that you can use as an escalation. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  How does csat work?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Csat is something that you can set up to put at the end of the emails and get reports on, you know, how they are responding. Okay?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. We can customize it, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Absolutely.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yes. Okay. So there is an hiver, AI?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Hiver, AI is something that I showed you wherein you can summarize compose, ask. AI is something that I showed you earlier wherein you can put your knowledge, my knowledge source.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You can create in hiver also if you're shifting from Monday and if you have it there or you can create, or if you already have it as a custom document, you can upload all of that here so that AI trains itself on those information and helps you when you're working on these tickets.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. Got it.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. Anything else you have to show me?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, I think this is it from my side, anything that you have anything else that you would want to see? Do you think apart from the form and the chatbot that we discussed apart from it? Do you see all of it is covering here? Like in terms of your requirements?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Yeah. For the ticket management? Yeah, because, yeah, this will be useful because the employees are quite addicted to the outlook. So the feature is same, looks like outlook only. Yeah. So I think it will be better for them to work on it. And what about the pricing? Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Pricing. Let me just show you. So there are different tiers of plans that we have. This is the annual pricing that you're seeing. So we have the growth plan pro elite based on the functionalities that you need. So for example, in the pro plan, we have seaside, but in growth, it's not there in terms of the SLA reports. If you want that's part of the pro plan. So depending on the functionalities that you need, we can make a decision, but I think pro will be good for you since it will have everything that you are looking for and will give you those items here. So, yeah, it's going to be per user per month basis. So it's going to cost you about 45 dollars into 19. And also the hiver AI is an add on for 20 dollars. So if you want hiver AI as well, then it's going to cost you 65 dollars per user per month.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Okay. 65. Okay, per user per month, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Do you have any budget already aside for this?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  No, we, yeah, we do have the management but we can propose it to them. So if we feel if everything works so well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me know in terms of your budget, we can be flexible. But of course, before we go into the pricing discussion, I would want to make sure that hiver ticks all your boxes and this is something you want to implement. And then pricing is something which we can always work on.

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Sure. Anyways, I'll discuss also with my avp, Urmila, I'll discuss with her. So please share the recording once you have it. So I'll discuss with her and I'll get back to you as soon as possible?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Lastly, I just want to understand Asha, like is there any timeline that you're looking to implement this solution by?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
  Within this month, hikta?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. By end of November. Yeah. Got it. No worries. Understood. No worries. Then let's discuss. We do have a free trial as well. So if you want to pilot it for a week or so, see how it's working. I'm happy to do that as well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But yeah, if you want to connect again for a quick feedback, in the meantime, I can also check for the portal thing. So to confirm, is it possible to connect back on Friday for a quick feedback?

Asha Chinnappa (asha@tascoutsourcing.com):
