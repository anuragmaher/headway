Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey guys.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  I can hear you. Can you hear me? I'm.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hearing echo myself. I'm also checking on jess. Okay.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  And there we go. Sorry. How are… you doing?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  I'm pretty good. How are you doing?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Not too bad.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  I think I'm the only one joining from our end today. I think both Elliot and April are out.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. No biggie… okay. I think we mainly want to check on AI number one and then number two, the project ops team status. And then do we have your renewal coming up too? I feel like.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  We do. I think the renewal's in March. Okay. Or at least I think that's when we signed.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I have like most of my renewals in the Q4, which is like, it gives me so much heartburn. Let me see. Just double check. Oh, wait, yeah, March of next year.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay? We got a little bit of time in. Okay, cool. Okay. So, AI, the sentiment analysis, how has that been going since we did some reconfiguration? You had like a support ticket in, right?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Yeah. So far, I think I've seen improvement. We set, I worked with Elliot to set up an additional shared inbox that just sends all of the negative emails or AI sentiment negative emails to that inbox. So that's been going well. I would say we don't have really a ton anyway, but I haven't come across any that were incorrectly labeled since the last time we spoke.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. Well, that's good news. Are you using any of the other AI features?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  I think we have AI tagging on right now, but I don't know what other I'm opening the admin panel, I can't remember what all, oh, hiver, AI.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Sure. We can talk about that.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  I have the thank you detector on which I believe we've been using for a minute. And then, yeah, I've got the sentiment analysis and we're doing the three point scale and then we have the tagging on, which actually… yeah. Okay. So we have an order issue tag delivery issue tag and then it looks like I haven't turned on the additional response tag that I put in there because the last time I looked at, it was doing some of the learning behaviors, but it looks like I don't have that actually turned on right now.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, I think it's doing some additional training here. It says eight out of 10 emails. Okay, cool. So I guess the next step would be to talk about pricing if the adoption is going well and you feel like sentiment analysis is working, that the AI tagging is helpful.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  You're using the thank you detector. We can talk about the other features that are available just in case it is something that you're interested in. But it would be the next step would be talk about pricing structure. So pricing starts at 20 dollars per user, which I know is pretty steep. We're certainly open to negotiating what we could do is send you a quote with what the starting price is, and then we can negotiate from there. Do you think that would be the easiest?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  I think so. Yeah, I think a lot of the times like my boss just needs something tangible to review and kind of explain, you know, the benefits or why we should go that direction because I mean, he did bring up to me that, you know, onboarding the 35 additional users is a pretty big undertaking. Well, I don't know if there's you know, wiggle room on that or if there's a way we can maybe continue piloting the AI service for a little bit longer before actually having to pay for it. I'm not really sure, you know what you guys offer in terms of working with us on that cost point, but yeah, I just wanted to see kind of your thoughts on that and, you know, what we could maybe discuss, but yeah, I think a quote would be really helpful.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, Ali on that front, you know, we can, we do have a little bit of flexibility when it comes to, you know, both the angles of that extra 35 people, the overall subscription cost if you want to renew sooner or work this contract in itself, right? And additionally just having AI bundled with that traditional growth of that 35 people, pretty much just makes it easier for us to have the price point dropped a little more. Now, the one thing that I wanted to have clarity on is in terms of timelines because, you know, we've had this discussion going back and forth. So what I do want to do is because any additional discounts that we'll be offering for you will require approval all the way to our C suite. So I want to make sure that I have some kind of tangible timeline that we're working backwards from that way, you know, if it comes down to just one dollar extra or more at the end of the day, that becomes a more straightforward discussion as opposed to us having to run up the ladder every single time, right?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Definitely.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. I mean as it stands right now, your per user cost is about 60 usd and the list price on the AI add on is 20. So net, you're looking at about 80 usd per person per month. And if we, and that's just for like the existing team, right? So that's 93 active users. As of today. Now, you mentioned about 35 additional people, which basically puts us at about 128 130 license count. If we're able to combine everything together, right? So, the first thing I want to understand is when we are looking at that scale of 130 users, is there any kind of price point that you're looking at or would hope arrange within which the price would be more conducive with or without the AI?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Not exactly. But I can follow up with my boss on that in full transparency. So we work with zoom for all of our like phone provider like totally separate. And recently they had tried to get us to basically migrate over to using their email platform in which I said no. But because of that, my boss wanted me to go back to you guys and see if you could work with us, but he didn't give me a certain price point. It just kind of all stemmed from zoom basically reaching out to us to renew our contract and having to elevate that up to my boss. I kind of just had to explain to him why we should stay with hiver. There are tons of limitations with zoom. So there's no plan to move over in that direction, but that's just kind of where that conversation started with my boss in terms of cost curiosity, but I can definitely get back to him and see if he has a specific price point in mind. But that's like as much information as I have currently. And then in terms of timeline, the projects team is going to be so much easier than what we've currently done because they already have a full team that would manage that and it wouldn't fall on me to do that. So honestly, like it would be a really pretty seamless onboarding process for us and they are ready to move on with that. He really just wanted to see, you know, if there is any way that we can reduce costs so that we can go ahead and do that now within our budget rather than having till the new year.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. That makes sense. All right. So then Ali, I mean if it's something you could have a discussion with your boss about and see if there's some kind of price range because what I do want to do is we roll out an offer and then your boss or, you know, as a business, you realize, hey, it's still too high and then we go back and forth on it, right? The approvals and the scale of your team on hiver. I'd rather we have a clear expectation, we try to stay a few dollars on and off around it. It would again make it easier. And again, like I said, you know, the 100 and 120 users discounting the AI or making it a whole elite and AI bundle again becomes a more easier conversation for us internally and from a commercially viable angle as well, right? That's effectively where I'm coming from and to your point, right? If we're able to have and I'm not looking for timelines on onboarding the team, but more from like a confirmation and a price point works kind of perspective, right? So if we're able to like, you know, maybe work towards a three weeks from now kind of timeline or four weeks from now kind of timeline, that's what my leadership would be expecting because we would be basically adding more discount on top of what we've already had contracted, right? And it's my contract. So that's where my questions stem from. And that's why I wanted to meet with you before I sent over any additional pricing information on that front.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Definitely. Yeah. And I think from our end, we would definitely like to get all of this done prior to the end of December. That way we're fully like everyone is on board. And then we can just see how things are going if we need to make any adjustments, but our projects team is ready to go ASAP. So I can get a for sure timeline in terms of confirmation. But honestly, once I can share like an updated quote, once I do talk to my boss on price point, then we'd be ready to give confirmation and go ahead and move forward. I don't see what else would be blocking that at that point?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood. And from an execution standpoint, if the price point makes sense, would, you know, would we still be able to like get it over the line and like a week kind of timeline?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  I would think so. I've already talked to my boss about this multiple times so it's nothing new. In fact, I have my regular touch base on Tuesday mornings so I can bring everything from this conversation to him and then could easily get you at least an answer this week and then we can go from there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. That makes sense. Ali. Okay. So what I, what we do is I'd still want to have some kind of expectation as well. So what I probably do is I'll bundle in the elite and the AI into a single offer that gives us additional leverage to, you know, add in additional discounts as well. I'll be quoting you for like 130 user total. So like, you know, 93 plus 25, 27 tentative, right? So that way I look at have a discussion with my leadership team, understand what kind of pricing buckets I can unlock or discount buckets I can unlock basically. And I'll be able to have pricing over to you tomorrow might be a little too early because veterans day, it's a bit of a holiday as well, right? So let me aim for Thursday for now. And if I'm ready by Wednesday, I should have something over to you by Wednesday.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Yeah, that works great. Like I said, we're once we can nail this down, we're ready to move forward with it. So we're in a good spot. I don't really foresee any delays to that simply because we've had hiver running long enough with our other folks that there's not much left other than finalizing the price point and then going ahead and like actually adding these users to hiver.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. That makes sense. And Ali, one of the things that our team would definitely ask us when I take this up the ladder is your inclination towards signing a multi year contract. If that's something that you do as a business… is that something that you typically do?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Yes and no. So we going back to zoom, we have a multi year contract with them, but we've had them for a really long time. So I would say if we could go through the rest of this contract through March, adding on these additional users and everything's going well. I don't see why we wouldn't be able to do a multi year deal when we're up for renewal because I mean, I do know there are price advantages with doing that. And like I said, we have several other services that are multi year agreements. So I absolutely think that that's something that we could look into given everything goes well and we're close to March and ready to resign.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Makes sense. That makes total sense. Well, I mean, from the pricing perspective or at least the angle of getting a quote ready and some numbers sent over to you. I think that's about all the information I need for the time being at the very least. So in my discussions with my team, I will be projecting us for like a December fifth confirmation, right? At this point, right? And hopefully we work our way backwards from there. Obviously, you know, we'll be open. In the meantime, we can be a little flexible in terms of the payment terms and things like this for this extra new team if that helps, right? Add like a net 30 if it helps so that you make the payment, you know, maybe a few weeks down the line.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Well, that said as next steps, I'm pretty clear. So what I'll be doing Ali, is I'll be sending you a quote including the AI add on, right? And that way you can check it out, let me know what reactions are like. And if needed, we can hop on like a 15 minute zoom or keep it over emails and we'll work our way backwards from there.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Perfect. Yeah. And I, there's only, there's really only one approval barrier between me. And then I report directly to our CEO. So he just has to like officially sign off on everything, which is why I kind of keep referring back to him because he's our ultimate like decision maker, right? So it's not, I don't have to go through a long chain of approval, which is really helpful. That's why we can typically get things done pretty quickly because I don't have to go through like tons of levels of middle management basically to talk to him, which is really nice.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. Now, that makes total sense for sure. Then I'll be sure I work with our team and unlocking the best discount possible with the bundle included. And that way, you know, you can probably keep it a little more easier on your end. And like you said, you know, we can definitely revisit multi year where we're looking at March next year.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Perfect. Sounds good to me.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Sorted, that was it for me, Ali and jess, back to you, jess.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. Did you want to review the other AI features just so you know what's there?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Yeah, sure. Let's.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  do that. Okay. My screen all right. So the only other thing you've got those two going would be the AI compose, which you probably have seen before, but that's like when you're composing an email, gives you the option to like set the tone or change the tonality… different ways. So.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it's this little bit so you can type like, hey, you, and you help me with something. If I were to click AI compose, I can fix the grammar and spelling and accept that. I could also say make it funny. And so I can… it'll make a suggestion. Obviously, that's not a great one. The other, you know, like make it shorter. Oh, it's not telling me. I guess it's like that's short enough. Make it more professional. Okay. So far, it's not giving me exactly what I'm looking for. Maybe I need to add more prompt to it. Let's see looking for… and help with… a technical issue. Let's see if that was a little bit better. And what is it for writing? Yeah. So you get the gist, it's basically like acting like a chat, gbt a little bit with some spelling and grammar updates. Okay. And then you have ask AI, which this is looking at knowledge sources that you provide. So when I hate that I have to talk, oh, wait, now I can go to the knowledge sources up here… so you would upload documents or articles. And then when you're in the front end of hiver in the side panel here… let's see the sandbox.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  You'll see this little like little magic thing. Okay. Maybe it's not enabled in this box. This always happens to me. Here we go. You click on the little like stars here and you can ask it a question and it's going to search the articles that you've uploaded, the documents that you've uploaded and suggest a response which you can then use as a reply. And we're iterating on the ask AI pretty quickly. So probably see some changes to that in the next. Like I don't know probably even as soon as like two weeks from now where it's going to like suggest replies based on past emails they're even looking at like connection with your entire Google library versus having to upload specific docs. So it'll get even easier and more user friendly over time. Do you guys have an internal knowledge base?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Well, I was going to ask actually because, we do. But one of the hard things for this industry specifically is different parts can be the same part, can be referred by different names, and especially with new sales reps, they struggle to basically translate what a customer is asking for. If it's not the exact product name that they're familiar with. There is a bunch of like product slang terms. So, I don't know if that's like that would be considered a document that we could upload to, where the sales rep could ask like what does this product translate to or something like that? I don't know if that's along the lines of what you're talking about.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it would have to exist in the doc itself like it would have to be able to search for that. But if you have like a glossary of terms and you were to upload a document like that? Sure. Yes.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Yeah. Okay. That's definitely something that like a glossary of terms. Yeah, we would benefit from that for sure, because right now we do have that, but they have to go reference it outside of their email or whatever. And it's kind of just doesn't really reduce the time that it takes to respond.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And I mean, if you're finding that for some reason, it's not like you did with sentiment analysis like it's not behaving exactly like you want it to our AI guru is very open and willing to get on calls to work with you to make sure you know that it is giving accurate results and provide recommendations and stuff like that. So that is the intent, yes, is to search through documents and return results based on that. Yeah.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Well, that's one thing I like about AI honestly is like if it's not right, it will become right? Like it learns based off what we're telling it. So, I mean, I know that comes with the nature of any AI service pretty much, yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah, true. Well, it's good that you're realistic. Yeah.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  No, seriously.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's all I had on our agenda today. Was there anything else you wanted to bring up?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  I don't think so. I actually just had one question and I only ask this because the sales reps consistently complaints me about this. Does it still need to be in conversation view? Like, is that going to be something that remains throughout basically the end of time?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yes, I don't know what the history is or the reason is for that, but yes, it does require conversation view.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  I mean… I don't really care at the end of the day, they just need to adjust and it's like a handful of them that have complained to me, but I figured I would ask in case anything did change. But I mean, personally, they can just get used to it. Like I'm so tired of holding their hands on everything like, you know, what? They can adjust.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  I don't even know what non conversation view looks like. People talk. What do you mean? Yeah.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  I actually didn't even know that it converts. I didn't even know that that's what it was called conversation view because that's just how mine has always been structured, but yeah, they can get over it.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  What is it? What does it do? If it's not in conversation view? This is, I think it splits the screen, right?

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  It shows the most recent emails instead of them having to scroll from top to bottom. I think if I understand correctly.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Like the, at least from the way they've described it, they don't like that you have to scroll all the way down to the end of the conversation, but I kind of that you.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Can control for.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Okay.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Inside your settings?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, if they're complaining about that in their hybrid settings here, you can reverse order of messages in a conversation which will show the latest message at the top.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Okay. How did you get there?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Hiver icon, my settings, and… then it's in basic settings here. So if you target that on, yeah, is.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  That something that they will all need to do on their own. Okay? Pretty easy. Honestly? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Easy. Well, then I'll get back to them with that. I think that should be fine. I think that was the only like pain point that they had expressed. So.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. Well, I'm glad you brought it up because that was an easy solve if that's what they're actually saying. I'm.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  pretty sure. So, yeah, I'll follow up with those few people and see if that helps. And if not, that's fine. But thank.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  you for sharing. Yeah, yeah, no problem. All right. That's all I had today. Raghav. Anything else?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Nope. I'm good on my end as well in terms of commercials and next steps there. So let me get wheels moving there. Let me get some conversations rolling and Ali, yeah, by or before Thursday, I'll send over some pricing and what that looks like for the whole bundle. Yeah.

Alli Styron (alli.styron@colonialelectric.com):
  Great. Awesome. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Have a good day. Talk to you tomorrow cheers.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Bye.
