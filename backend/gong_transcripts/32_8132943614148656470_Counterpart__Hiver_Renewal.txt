================================================================================

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  hi, Tiffany. How are you? How are you? Nice to meet you. I.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Know, likewise. I'm good. How are you?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  I'm doing alright. I'm off tomorrow. So I'm just like I.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  know that's like the Thursday before you have a Friday off as always. Yeah. Are you doing anything?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Special? Yeah, I'm going to asheville to celebrate some friends, a friend's birthday.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  North Carolina. Is that right? Yeah. Okay, cool. Cool.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I am in Raleigh, North Carolina. So, it's about three hours from me.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Nice. Yeah. I have a, my cousin's family is based there. Okay?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Have you been, I.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  haven't been, unfortunately, but yeah, I haven't traveled. I'm on the west coast, so I haven't traveled as much to the east as I would like to have, but it looks beautiful, especially like this time of year. I feel like it would be so.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Pretty, where are you on the west coast?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  I'm based like a little bit outside of Los Angeles. So like, yeah, kind of in the la, orange county border.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Orange county. I only know about orange county from the real housewives which I'm sure is not.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Yeah, which is it's always funny. I was like, yeah, I don't know that la and orange county are like portrayed quite accurately, but it is a, you know, it is one piece of orange county. So, yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Oh, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure it is, but I feel like anywhere you go, you could probably find similar people. You know what I mean? It's just the.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Orange.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  County ladies are interesting. I have, I hate to admit that I've watched almost every real housewife. So.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Me too. I'm a, I love like people are surprised to find. I love reality TV, but I'm like, you know what? After? Like the work we do, it's like you just need something to like absolutely like numb your mind, you know? Yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Brain turns off. Yeah, like I love watching. Love is blind. I like watching that one in a group more than by myself. But currently on a below deck kick watching all the below deck.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Oh, I have watched below deck like, I had a bravo era where I was watching a lot of bravo reality TV. So, I have watched below deck but not in like quite a while, but, oh.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I've gone back to it. I started with season one even though I probably did that a long time ago. I'm already at like season five and it's only been a couple weeks. I'm pretty sure… what's your favorite?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Ooh, I don't.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  know.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  I don't know. Let's see in terms of reality TV, I find. So like the real housewives was like always very entertaining. And then I found like the early seasons of like vanderpump rules pretty entertaining. Oh, yeah, yes. Yeah. So, I mean, have you?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Watched the, have you watched the valley yet?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  No, that's like the spinoff, oh yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yes, yeah. It's like where the vanderpump people are supposed to be adults, yes.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  I don't think they'll ever be like they're in, they're fully middle aged now and I don't think that, they are.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  No, they like have children and stuff. Yeah.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  And I'm like, no, they're like slightly better, but.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  I don't know how people why I don't know. I'm like, do people really act like this? I can't I just cannot imagine apparently.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  So, anyway,

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  we've added a face here, Raghav, who is an account manager at hiver. So we work together. He's more on the like commercial side of things. So, if we're talking about expansions or upgrades or like new departments being onboarded, then he would help us with the commercials and just having the communication with maybe some of the new representatives to, from the other departments to showcase hiver et cetera. So that's his role. I'm sure he just wanted to come in and meet everyone. And, oh, that was your note taker. I thought it might be Ryan because he did say that he was going to come. So, yeah.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  I think he looks like he's in another meeting that's running a bit long, so he might join me.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  That's totally fine. Okay. So I wanted to do a couple things during this meeting. One is to base, you know, most importantly is to talk about your renewal just to make sure we're aligned on the user count and the plan level. And then I can send over a quote for pricing another agenda item was just to like get a general feel for how things are going with hiver. I want to make sure that maybe we can set up another call after this to go over the workflows and some of your more busier shared mailboxes. So I can, so I can get an in depth understanding of how you're using hiver. I did do a quick scan of all of the shared mailboxes and it looks like they're being used at a pretty basic level. Really not no automations, no slas. So I'm wondering if there could be additional opportunity to use some of the other features that aren't currently being used. So I think those were the three. There might be one other hang on. Yeah, that was it. Oh, and then a couple of weeks, I don't know time's weird. But you did interact with our support team around intercom. It sounded like you're using intercom, and there might be some like integration questions. So I wanted to better understand like how you're using intercom… and maybe you were evaluating our chat potentially and how it compares to intercom. So I just wanted to talk a little bit about that too. Did you have anything else?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  No, I think that covers all of it. Yeah. And the intercom piece I think was Ryan's I think Ryan brought it up because he, we kind of we use hiver in kind of two separate ways. So like I manage our like submission intake team. And so they're the ones using hiver the majority of the time. And then we're looking to expand our like more general external support function. So like this would be right now, like we mostly use it with our kind of internal. We have like a third party kind of like data entry team that we use. So that's kind of how we're mostly using hiver today. But then eventually we are looking to expand to kind of use with like kind of external like retail brokers and that sort of thing. So that's the piece that I think Ryan is most interested in. So if he's able to hop on later, then he can probably give a little bit more color into how because yeah, if we don't need two, you know, pieces of software then yeah, we'd love to just like move forward with hiver but I know that there were some limitations in terms of like what we get with intercom. But yeah, I know that there was some work that was being done to like pretty much like, yeah, be aligned. So, yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. Well, we can talk to if he comes on. Well, I'll ask him some more questions about intercom. So your team doesn't use intercom. That's more Ryan's.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  that is, yeah, that is more Ryan's well, he himself is using it. So it's not really. I think he's like the sole user at the moment. And then we're looking to kind of, yeah, expand that a bit more next year.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Okay. So on the renewal front, you are currently on our pro package pro plan, okay, which is all which makes sense however, and you might have seen this messaging, but you are over the shared mailbox limit. So there's a limit of five shared mailboxes on the pro plan. So we would need to move you to the elite package at renewal. Okay? So I can send over an initial quote with the elite upgrade included to give us a starting point. And then we can negotiate from there if needed. Okay? And then right now we have you at 50 users. Are you thinking you want to stay there or are you thinking about potentially expanding with that other team before the renewal?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Not before what is our exact renewal date? Yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  I was just thinking about that and I think I have pulled it up. Yeah, December second.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  December second. Okay. Yeah, I don't expect expansion prior to that. Okay? We're not going to, we're not going to grow our team too significantly, I would say even until like the first half of next year. So, I guess is there a limitation on our current plan or the elite plan for number of users?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  No, yeah. The, you can have as many users as necessary or needed on any plan level. It's just the number of shared mailboxes. So there's some areas of limitation. Automations has a limitation on pro, as does the number of shared mailboxes. Okay. Yeah. So yeah, you would be fine to add users next year. And are you the in external support team, would that be part of the expansion next year?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Yeah. So we have our, yeah. So our external support team and then we're still thinking through kind of our more general, whether we would expand with that team that we're working with directly or we would expand more internally within the company. We're still deciding. Okay. But I don't know that would be like too many additional people like I would see say at most like maybe 10 to 15. Okay. Yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  And what would be the other departments that you were considering?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Sorry. What was that? You broke up like for a little bit?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Oh, sorry. What are the other departments outside of the external support teams? What are the other departments you were considering?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Yeah. So right now, so yeah, it's our external support team and then we have our underwriting teams using hiver too. So like that's how, you know, our intake team is kind of the first line where they enter submissions that come in and then our, it's a nice link between our like internal underwriting team because they can kind of, you know, whether it's used like sort of the, you know, chat comment function or the tagging function, like they're able to do that and correspond right in the email so that it's kind of it's kind of hybrid. So it's like our external support and then our internal underwriting team, they both use it. I would say like in terms of the actual functionality, I think our, we mandate that our external… users use more of those features. So like templates, tagging comments, all of that and, but we kind of leave it up to the discretion of like our underwriting team, how little or how much they want to use it. So, whether they want to use hiver as a tool to like, you know, manage their inbox or assign things to themselves, like that's a little bit more their discretion, but, I'd be like curious to know more about the features so that we can, you know, potentially like, you know, give them those tools and then they can, you know, train them on those tools and then they can utilize it even more cause, they are like probably half of the user base. Yeah, 50 that year that you've mentioned. Yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  So I did notice that. Yeah. So when we scheduled a follow up call, I think we can spend that time going through, that team's workflows, like how they're currently using hiver, how they're, conversations happen across teams, what kinds of, a task or actions they're taking on emails? Having some of those additional details may give me insight into other parts of the platform where, they could find value. Maybe it's automations, maybe it's slas, maybe there's things on the front end, you know, that they're not aware of, after we have the workflow review, maybe then we decide like let's train the team or let's set up a success plan and start to optimize on implementing some of the new features. So, the first step of the process would be that workflow review. And then from there, we could deviate however necessary. Does that make sense? Yeah. Sounds great. Cool. Okay. Hi, Ryan. Welcome.

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  Hi, sorry. I'm late. I was on another call that went way over. That happens?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  It's okay.

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  I'm actually very invested in this conversation. It's unfortunate that it was back to back with another one. But, I, I know that I'm coming in super late and if, forgive me if I am, discussing things that we've already covered. But I think, one thing that I'm thinking about personally is, so the way that our organization has been, and tiff, if you said this already, I feel so bad that I'm going to repeat it. But like, but the way that our organization has been, we're growing like weeds. And so, I'm sure you can see that on the hiver side as far as number of users that we're adding. But we're growing like weeds and as, you know, with like a startup, it's you know, you kind of have, when you're a startup you have, kind of, you give every customer the white glove service, right? When you're starting. And then as you grow, you kind of build out your tiering system of how you support customers, right? And so, I think we're getting to a point where we're going to be more leaning more into the one to many model. And so having, well, yes, we have our underwriting at your counterpart alias, which then is automatically assigned to a specific underwriter based on, you know, their region. And I actually don't know all the nuances of how it works. To be honest, Tiffany would know better than I would, but I think that there is this we want to support like we're we are driving as an organization also leveraging our technology. And so like, well, insurance is a very relationship based business. We are pushing on those newer brokers to leverage tools like our own portal to interact with counterpart. And so, the way that, and so, like we have most people submit, their applications to us via email, very old school way of using insurance like insurance. But now we're having, we're getting more adoption with our portal and people are interacting with our portal. And so, we don't have in some, and we're adding different types of customers. So, like we have like our wholesale brokers that we normally interact with on a day to day basis. But now we're starting to like actually service some retailer submissions, which is a different customer set. And so, like they don't have access to our underwriters. We keep them kind of protected. And so, we only have like the support alias for that support at your counterpart. Com. And so, we want to figure out how to basically advance the, and support is at your counterpart. Com is kind of a catch all where a lot of times we're moving, those emails to another queue and it's kind of, the main hub. I guess you could say, for a lot of the portal business that we're getting. And so, one way that we've been supporting them today, well on our website, and I talked about this last time on when we were just like kind of revisiting hiver and like functionality is like, we have two tools for our, like we have intercom, which is for like we technically had it supporting our email alias, like support at your counterpart. Com. But then we also had like the chat functionality, and we still have that chat functionality on our website and within our portal. I've since turned off the, the email functionality within intercom because, I like hiver and I like how it works. However, it's hard to have two different systems where chat is in one and then email is in another. And so, and the chat feature that we have today, I'm giving you a whole lot of word vomit, but like, I think it's helpful context, but like the chat functionality, yeah, like chat functionality is used as an AI bot initially. And then when they escalate, it will go to like a person. And so, I want everything that's support related or portal related to go to support at your counterpart. Com or like be in the same queue of some sort. And so that's ideally, what I would love to see. I know that it sounded like based on my last conversation that like AI.

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  I'm just kind of giving you my wants and needs. Ooh, I don't know why my camera went off but.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  You were breaking up a little bit. So I think I turned it off so I could hear you a little bit better. Feel free to turn it back on.

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  But no worries. No worries. It's okay. I'm not looking that great today anyway… no, but just kind of giving you, I think that, our needs are expanding and that's just like, that was a really long winded way of saying that, but I like, as we grow, we want, and as we grow the types of customers that we support, you know, we, I want to make sure that there's still a consolidated way, a manageable way for us to be able to support all of those, inquiries in a very timely manner. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. Sorry for, kind of, you know, changing up the subject a little bit, but I hope that's kind of helpful context. We don't, to the point though that we were, you guys were talking about as far as like workflows. We don't have a workflow, for the support, email stuff. We, I just started really using hiver only recently and getting other teammates in, there. But based on the type of inquiry, I want to be able to, you know, the inquiry comes in and it needs, okay, in this case, it's very tactical. It needs to go to our data entry team. This, oh, this is an appetite question. It needs to go to our underwriter, you know, like, and be able to route those appropriately. Yeah, I'm going to pause any questions.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. So currently, you're using intercom for chat and are you,

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  and knowledge base? I guess I should say we use, yeah, we do use the knowledge base,

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Internal or external?

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  External. Yep.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  External. Okay. And I would assume that the chat, AI chat is referencing the knowledge base.

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  So, it's yes, good question. It's referencing our knowledge base, our external knowledge base. It's referencing our website. It's referencing our other company website, which is zero HR, which is like an additional service. Like it's kind of like another company that we built to another company that we built, but anyway, but it references their knowledge base and their website as well, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  It has not been optimized. So, if you do test ours out, it's not very good. So.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  I'm not going to, so don't worry not yet. Anyway. So the way that our chat is currently built in the Gmail platform is manual and I think you had this conversation with, the support team a little bit. It's essentially a, bot like a flow that you build out on the backend based on things that you are hard coding into text fields, right? So, we don't plan to add any feature functionality on top of that in the, Gmail interface as it stands today. What we are iterating on is our omnichannel platform. Okay. And our omnichannel platform, is, email agnostic, so you can have any email provider and use the omnichannel platform. It is, a bit, behind in terms of development and some of the features and functionalities that you have available to you today in the Gmail platform. Okay? That all being said, we are building more of the chat features into the Omni platform. Okay? So, and you can use the omnichat, only, in that platform and continue to use Gmail. We could also talk about moving you to the Omni platform if you want to, integrate your chat with your email system. That would prop, at this point, that would be the best option if you're looking to consolidate. I don't know that it's going to be to par, with what you have in intercom today. Like in terms of being able to connect your KB, to the, chat widget. I don't know a lot about how far we are into the AI capabilities with chat. Okay? Raghav, do you want to chime in? I saw you took yourself off mute.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no. I was just waiting for you to complete in terms of just understanding.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Feel free to jump in.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Excuse me. Yeah, Brian. So, from an intercom perspective, and just the general direction we're taking with the hybrid chat, right? We're obviously heading towards a place where we want to make chat as agentic as possible, right? To the extent where like you're doing today, right? I'm sure you've got a few agent workflows running up on intercom that basically do L1 deflection for you is pretty much what I'm hearing from you. Yes, people come in, ask basic questions, AI surfaces. The answer based on knowledge base summarizes gives a debt after maybe two or three, you've probably got to check at a spot and then you say talk to an agent at this point onwards. Yeah. Is that similar to what you're doing right now?

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  Correct. Yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So that's effectively the direction we're building in terms of hybrid AI chat as well. And our direction for chat is to have it be AI focused and pretty much do these L1 deflections for you to Jessica's point. It's not something that we have completely fleshed out today, but we do have the foundation blocks that would be required to take it there at this point, right? In the sense of we've got the knowledge base. We've got our version of co pilot that we use that you have access to within your hybrid Gmail interface as well. And the plan is to have the two combined and have that on the web based platform that we're internally calling as hiver only, right? Okay. So, the couple of things that I do want to ask you about considering your own intercom and you're looking at a direction of consolidation down the line apart from the basic L1 deflections today? What would be some of the things you'd expect to evolve the AI chat or the chat and the conversation flow into?

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  I mean.

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  They're like… I think obviously, I wanted to feel the, those questions. Those initial questions I think that there are with chat, I think just to give you like things that I think intercom does well, that I think that we will want to take advantage of is like I think that when someone runs into an issue on our platform, which again, I will know like insurance is such an old industry and, they have old workflows but we have new younger blood that's basically starting to adopt technology and our own portal which we haven't really driven adoption in until now and like, but, when the one challenge that we have is like a broker will reach out and say, hey, I'm getting an error on this page and like it's like I can't see the page that they're looking at. But technically intercom does have that functionality. We just haven't optimized it on our end where it's like we can literally see what they are seeing on their page. And like basically, it's not snapshot of that. And I think like that is something that will be really helpful I think in general though like, and something you guys can do today is routing, just making sure that it, you know, when a request comes in, that it goes to the right team member. Obviously like being able to feel those questions. Those initial questions, I think in general like, we would want, we want, I think like if I'm giving you the whole world and like the whole like ecosystem of like where I'm seeing the future is like, I think that like we want someone to be able to and this may be too forward thinking but like down the line, someone can call us and they get an AI bot that they talk to and they know that they're talking to an AI bot and they're requesting changes to like subs, like very small things. They have the ability to actually take action on something in our portal and like, you know, change the limit or change the retention on this policy on this quote, excuse me, like for it to action those things. I know that, that's very forward thinking but I want you to know that we are very forward thinking as an organization. So like, you know, not just limiting it to chat, but like maybe eventually phone support as well and being to have that queue of, you know, those things as well. So, I don't know if that's helpful.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It is, it is, you know, definitely long term big picture that's definitely making sense. You know, the voice angle of it. I'm sure we'll probably split it up into three different types right now as it stands today before I had it back to jess to sort of continue the discussion, right? So, from what I'm hearing you're interested in chat being the first medium of interaction as opposed to having people email you, you'd like for the chat widget or the experience to be at a space where your team or the tool itself can automatically surface suggestions for the customer based on what they're running into. Website down, can't find the article unable to locate this bit of info within a knowledge base, things like that. And obviously, I'm guessing when you say routing, it's pretty much going to be based on a mapping of how you evolve your team going from like a dedicated to a pooled model and having it routed to the right person. Now, all of this kind of tracks with, the way we're envisioning on building out the chat bot or the chat model on hiver as a whole feature, right? What I would like to understand this is, as of today or in the near immediate future, if you were to look at transitioning to hiver for chat, what will be the two or three things that you'd need, right? And, you know, it's okay if you don't have that answer right away, but what we would like to do is have that consolidated with us internally so we can pass it to our product team and ensure that we keep you apprised of any enhancements down the line.

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  I think the bare minimum for us really or like us to transition to like your chat is, like AI is going to be like huge, like, I think that to be honest, like before we turn that on, I was managing all of that queue and not to say that it's super, like we have a ton of inquiries but like they're expecting a response in a timely manner. And so, even if there aren't that many of them, but we do answer them very quickly, that is like huge for us. So, like having and having it be able to reference, you know, even its internal articles or external articles. I think would be massive, that, that's the only way that we would consider even moving consolidating, and launching something like that with you guys. Cause like we already know what it's like, to use AI chat. So, it's like we can't go backwards now, we're like we're too good, like too happy with what we have now. So, yeah, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Totally, that makes sense. And I noticed a bunch of, the agentic stuff that you've got going as a business as well. So, I'm sure that's the direction you're leaning in. Yeah, right. That, that tracks for the time being. Thanks for that. We've made a note of this conversation going on that front. But with that said, jess, back to you.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. So in summary, I think, you know, based on what your needs are sticking, with intercom for now is probably the best option. Have you, thought about routing or like at the point that they need to move to an email conversation? What does that process look like? Are you giving them an email address? And then they're emailing the shared mailbox?

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  So, by default, like, those inquiries will go to support, if there's like any like it support at your counterpart. Com, there will be, it will automatically like cause like I'm not like, at three am if they write back to us like no one's really responding to it and they're they need to talk to a person. It's already escalated past like the AI bot. If there's like a period of time, I don't know what the timeframe is. It will automatically forward, that updated conversation to support at your counterpart. Com? Yes. Yep. And so, yeah, go ahead.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Do you have live agents? So at some point, if they're like talk to an agent, they're just like talk to an agent, I want to talk to somebody. Do you have live agents, managing the chat?

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  We are sort of no one's super dedicated. It's kind of like pooled support right now. It's like me and one of our underwriters and, I'm hoping that maybe tiff, not tiff, but like, maybe the data entry team will be able to support in some capacity as well. So, yeah.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Yeah, that's right. We're looking, we kind of had this discussion before you popped on, right? And it's like we're looking to expand the support function and then, like, we have a new role coming on to like our operations team that's going to purely like kind of comb through what we have support and as support in general, and then just kind of see where we need to expand. So, yeah, it's a little gray right now, but I know there are, there is a focus on it, starting next year.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  And don't hate me. I do have to jump. I know I came late and I like dropped bombs. But, I appreciate your, I look forward to the follow up like I am very much invested in, you know, like, I understand, that you may not have all the functionality today. I do think that the art of the possible, of what you can do is super important for us. So, like if there's things, if you have customer success stories with other insurance agencies that, and I know we're unique, we are totally unique in the sense that we are much more innovative and like in many cases, so, it's unlikely that they may be using it the same way or have similar workflows. But if you have any examples of like how other companies are leveraging it, like we need to be inspired, I think in some cases, where, you know, the art of the possible, instead of just saying, hey, you need to do, this and this, like maybe there's someone that's doing it really well that we can, you know, be inspired by. So, yeah, okay.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can definitely make that part of the follow up. I do have other insurance companies that I work with. Maybe slightly different. So, I think it would be helpful as like a next step to have that workflow conversation even if you think you don't have one, just at least telling me, what you do have in place, like how you're signing emails just, you know, like the basics. And I think we can make some initial recommendations from there and then maybe find some, success stories or other partners that we have, maybe that you could connect with on top of that,

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  One other thing that I think will be super helpful which I have, I've wanted to get wanted to do, but I have not gotten to and tiff, if, you know this. Forgive me. But if reporting wise, I like want to quantify like, I want to quantify like how we like, what can we measure, from what we have today? And like if there's things that we can't measure today because of our configuration, that would be good to know. But I'm and, yeah, I mean, there's only so much that you would know, because like you don't know our business like completely. But if there's ways to measure like, or have any metrics to share with us, that could be super helpful for us to just get a sense of like what's possible to measure and start being able to say, you know, like our SLA is bad. Like, are we not responding to emails quick enough or like, what is it that we need to be doing, to improve just like our overall like service levels? Yeah?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, we can definitely make that part of, the next steps too is to look at reporting and talk about your KPIs, or the things you'd like to report on, and optimize there for sure? Cool.

Ryan Capra (ryan.capra@yourcounterpart.com):
  All right. I have to jump. I'm so sorry, thank you so much. We will talk soon.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. Thank you. And then Tiffany, I'll work with you quickly, to get another meeting on the calendar. Let's see, ooh, the seventeenth. I know the week of the 20 fourth is tricky, but, are y'all working that week? Yeah?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  We will be in, I should be in too. Yeah. So any, yeah, anytime that week should be fine. Yeah, other than the holidays, okay?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  So,

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  let's.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  do, either the 20 fourth or the 20 fifth and y'all are Pacific Time,

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Yeah, Ryan is, I think he's based in Austin. So, I think he's two hours ahead, but I think, I could probably do, yeah… I can do like morning or anytime after one pacific. So, I know that might be late in your day. So we can do morning. Maybe I'm.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  I'm available on Tuesday, two to four P. M, Eastern Time.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Two to four eastern. Okay. So that'd be, yeah, we can do. Yeah. So I'm free from like, yeah, one to two, eastern. Yeah, one to two. Yes, one to two 30 eastern. I am free.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  One to two. Okay.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Does any time?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Hang on. Let me do some math here. I'm not available. One to two.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Okay. I.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  would I could do one to, I could do one to two? Well, I don't know, tell me when you're available, and then, so.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  On Monday, I'm free anytime other than, pretty much two to two, two to four. I'm not free your time. But any other time works? So it could be morning or after that. And then Tuesday, I'm just not free between. What is that? It's just not free between two 30 and four, Eastern Time?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Okay. I appreciate you putting it at Eastern Time.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  It's like the small math, but I.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  know, I'm like trying to do it on my head. I just like, I need a calculator. How about, is, what time do you start work?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  I started around like anytime like after eight is fine.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Eight. Okay. Let's look. So in… 30? Okay… that would be seven 30. So that's not going to work. Okay?

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  About.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  okay. You said you're not available, to? Okay. Let's just go. What about one to two on Monday Eastern Time? So that would be,

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  10.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that would be 10 your.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  time. Yeah, I can do 10 that works. That works. Okay. Yeah.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  It, did we want to include Ryan or do we want to just focus? Yeah, let's, include.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Ryan, yeah, if, he can't make it, then that's okay. Cause I can, I think, I'm probably the person to walk through workflows more. Okay. But yeah, I feel like it's good that he jumped on, cause I think the intercom conversation was important and I think we can, yeah, I can walk through a little bit more in depth with like how we're using how we're using hiver today, and then we can get any recommendations for the next.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  One. Okay, great. Yeah, I wish I could, I wish I could just be like, yes, we can do everything that intercom can do. But yeah, we're not there. We are iterating, like I said, on the Omni side of things, and maybe at some point, it would make sense just to have to migrate your environment over to the Omni platform, cause otherwise, you're going to end up again with two separate platforms because our chat in the Omni platform doesn't integrate with the Gmail platform. So again, you would just have this Omni chat and then you would have hiver for Gmail. So it wouldn't necessarily help from a consolidation perspective other than you're you've got both on hiver, and not a separate contract with intercom. And I don't know what, like what that would look like from like a payment structure. I'm sure we could work something out, but, all of that to be said, like, we are still working on the AI functionality. So, I do think maybe it could be, a part of our plan to talk with our AI, product manager, to get to like, look at the roadmap from a chat perspective to see what, we are doing with it. Like we can make that part of our, working plan together.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Sure. Okay.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  All right. Ascent overlay invite. I'll also work on getting you the quote for the renewal. Now, the, your internal process for approvals, does that work pretty quickly or how long would we expect the approval process to take?

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Yeah. So, I'll have to reach out to our finance manager, but I feel like it's relatively, yeah, relatively quick. I think they might have a few questions, but I think it makes sense given like our expansion and, you know, additional inboxes and that sort of thing. So.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Sure. Yeah. Okay. I just want to, if we find we're getting close to that December second date, maybe we need more time, we can just keep an open dialogue about that.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Sure. Okay, all.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Right. We will. You'll I'll follow up shortly with the quote, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks awesome.

Tiffany Park (tiffany@yourcounterpart.com):
  Thank you so much, all.

Jessica E (jessica@grexit.com):
  Right. Thank you. Bye bye.
