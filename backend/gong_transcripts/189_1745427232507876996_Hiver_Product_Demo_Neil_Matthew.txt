================================================================================

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  yes, matt. How are you doing today?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good. How are you doing good. Awesome. Well, appreciate you joining the agenda for the call today. Just wanted to help you determine if hiver can fit your needs. And then from there, we can walk through the product and answer any questions that you have. Sound good?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Sounds great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, Neil, if you could start here, tell me a little bit about kind of what motivated you to book this meeting today.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Well, so I'm reaching out on behalf of bioscript. So I am our technical architect and we're looking at some solutions that might exist in the marketplace to help with some of our workflow automation for some of our customer facing parts… of our business. Like we have multiple different business units… who interface with the public. So we're a pharmaceutical organization based in Canada. And yeah, taking a look at, you know, with some of the tools like hiver… could we, you know, we have to give you some sense of what we're dealing with, have about 1,300 emails received in, through some of our shared mailboxes. So we have four shared mailboxes that receive that many emails on a daily basis. And then emails could be related to patient referrals, updates, like drug monitoring requests, medical clarifications, like there's a lot of different types of emails we'll receive. So some other examples are like appointment cancellations… things like that, and they ultimately get triaged and categorized and we respond to them within 24 hours. And so we're currently using, you know, shared mailboxes, we're on Microsoft infrastructure. So we're using office 365. And, you know, they have a process where multiple shared mailboxes are used and subfolders are used, and people are funneling emails in the subfolders but, you know, it's a little. It's not the greatest process in terms of tracking who's doing what. And so, yeah, we wanted to assess hiver to see if there might be a good fit there.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  OK. Got it. Yeah, absolutely. This is a very common use case for us. We work with a ton of companies that are in the health care industry or in the pharmaceutical industry. And then basically, yeah, people come to us just like you said, because they have these shared inboxes, they're not using anything right now and they're looking for better ways to just kind of triage these categorize them and get better visibility, just, you know, because you kind of obviously, with this many emails probably have outgrown your current process of just using outlook for this. So, yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's definitely something that we do here at hiver.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, and we don't really have any other channels like SMS or social media that we'd want to include in there right now, but that could be something we do later, right? OK.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  And even in terms of like leveraging AI functionality… you know, like it'd be good to just learn what are the possibilities in hiver and how could we, yeah… how could we leverage its capabilities to basically improve our automation and improve our existing email workflows?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  OK, perfect. Absolutely. Yeah, we do have some other ways to use hiver, but yeah, I'll just, we'll predominantly focus on email. I just wanted to give you a little background about hiver, customer service, help desk platform we have over.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Sorry to interrupt you. Is it possible to record this too? Just so I could share with my other colleagues?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Absolutely. And, should I send you the recording as well?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, if you can, after the fact that'd be great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Yep. So, yeah, a little bit about hiver, customer service help desk platform. We have over 200 employees. We have over 2000 customers in over 50 countries with teams using our platform ranging from small businesses, up to some of the largest companies in the world, and also many companies in the health care space, visiting angels, allidade, garner health, new hope, fertility crossover, just to name a few. We're also hipaa compliant, if that's probably a need of yours as well.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah. Well, in Canada, it's a little bit different like with pepita, but yeah, that's good to know though.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  That's right? Got it. And then, yeah, a lot of the things that you said, a lot of the issues that you might be not necessarily issues but maybe just a better way to handle it. Sounds like you were saying, these are huge reasons why these companies come to us. You know, especially when it comes to email, right? It's very hard to see who's handling these emails. Maybe you have to forward and CC them to get other people involved. You're manually routing and tagging these emails. There's no unified view of the past conversations. Maybe you have to switch to multiple platforms, which if we have some integrations, maybe that you use on a day to day could also help you out. And then also we get you'll get visibility into analytics for as far as like team performances processes, how long it's taking you to handle these emails you have. And some of the impacts that teams that use hiver do experience are things such as, you know, two to three X, faster response times, saving time on a lot of these repeatable inquiries that you might get with some different automations that we have using the AI for consistent on brand communication, faster ramp up of new hires, a 50 percent reduction in manual effort, and then just better faster responses for a better experience for these customers that are emailing into you. You said it's customer facing, right?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, in this case, it is, yeah. Like with patients, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Well, perfect. So hiver is a web application and you're just going to simply log in. People are just going to be able to log in using their Microsoft credentials. And then you mentioned, you have four emails, right? So what you can do is you'll see these folders on the left hand side. Each one of these folders is tied to a shared email address.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Gotcha.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. So the workflows could be different for each one. And every single time somebody emails that address, it's going to land in the unassigned folder in that folder there.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then when you open these, you're going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can go ahead and assign it to each other, right? So it's very clear who's assigned it. When you get assigned work, you're going to get a notification here. And then you're also going to see there's a mind section here. So everyone's going to have their own mind section. And that's just all the emails that have been assigned to them.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Gotcha.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then as far as like automations… that thing hiver can do to speed it up is we can also set up automations so that they get assigned to the right person. So like for instance, here, if you handled all the invoices in this address, then we could set up an automation based on keywords. So anytime an email comes in and it mentions the word invoice or any words that would let it know, it's an email that you handle, we can have it automatically get assigned to you.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Nice. Okay. So any type of content in the emails, we could set up rules like that, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yep.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then now there's statuses too open pending and closed. So you'll always know like does this email need more action? Has it been taken care of? And then, you know, the follow up question I usually get to that is, can you create custom ones? So you can create these custom fields down here. And these can be numerical fields. They can be text fields, and they can be date fields. But yeah, you can create these custom fields down here. If there's anything else custom that you were looking to track.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Gotcha.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then there's also tags. So this is how you're going to categorize these emails. So we can run reports on these emails. You know, we can quickly sort by them, right? So, if this email that came in was relating to a billing issue, we can just add the billing issue tag.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Is there a way to try and auto tag them too?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So the same way we can create automations on assigning to people, we can also create automations with those tags.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Gotcha. And then if we're trying to do reporting after the fact, like let's say we had a, I don't know a billing related issue sitting there for a really long time, right? Like being able to sort of detect that I think will be valuable for us.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, we have analytics.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And you're going to get a lot of information in this analytics field, you select the timeframe you want to see could be custom, could be last 90 days, right? And like in the last 90 days, it can show me, okay, you know, in the last month or whatever you selected, we got 14 emails about billing issues. We got nine emails about, you know, those things. And then within these emails, it's going to track what's your average response times with those tags… and you can even see, you can even see the emails where like it sat for a long time.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Gotcha. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But yeah, when it comes to the reporting too, you can create reports and look for specific timeframes, you can run reports on those specific tags. Also, like you mentioned, you want to set up slas, we can also set up slas here where it's like if nobody responds within 24 hours, you'll get notified, it's late. So basically, we can say, okay, last month, how many times did we violate that SLA? So last month, you know, we violated it 10 times, 10 times, there were emails where people didn't respond within 24 hours.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And these are the emails right here. And then, you know, these are the types of emails where we didn't do it, right? And then these are the people as well. So you can create these custom reports. You can save these views. So you don't have to filter every time. But yeah, absolutely. We can run reporting for those tags and then the response times… great.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  And then from an email perspective, like if we sign in with our Microsoft 365 credentials, is it copying all the emails over to hiver or what happens from like a data perspective?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No. So it's it. So, yeah, the emails are still going to be living within your outlook in that nothing's happening on the back end. It's just basically imaging it over to hiver here.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  OK. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And I can send over our security information as well.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, it'd be good to get a sense of that just so that we would just from a data and security perspective, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep, of course. Yep. Absolutely. And as I showed you, I work with, you know, some of the largest companies in the world. So, so, yeah, you know, soc two compliant GDPR compliant, iso certified hipaa compliant. So, yeah, happy to send you some preliminary information on that. And then also down here is the notes section. So this is where you can take notes, but also this is where you can collaborate. So you hit the mention button. Everybody's name in the account pops up and it's like, hey, Cole, can you help on this? So the team's going to be able to just go back and forwards on these emails internally and communicate on things, that need to communicate on.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Also, another huge time saver here is obviously, you can reply directly here in hiver, the benefit to being that everybody who has access to this folder can see this reply. So you don't have to CC anybody. All the replies are visible. You can set up email templates that can be shared with the team.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. So that you can just use these templates for those kind of repeatable emails that you get. We also have various AI features. One of them is like an AI chat gpt built in here. So it can just quickly fix the grammar, make it shorter et cetera. And then another thing that we have is an AI copilot which can actually draft replies for you. It's going to ask a three prompt question. You choose which one you want, and it will go ahead and draft a reply. And how it works is it actually learns from the emails that you've been getting. And it can also reference a knowledge base. You can build a knowledge base or it can reference just specific documents that you've uploaded or urls.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Gotcha. Okay. Where did you say we maintain the templates again?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, the templates are, you can access them right here in the email, okay? And then.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  But we can maintain them somewhere under like the admin or?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah. It's going to be in the admin panel for the templates, okay? Where you build them and stuff.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then there's also the team view here. This is really, you know, where you get that visibility. This is going to show you all the open emails across that address… right? So, I know in this healthcare email, we have 28 open emails right now. They've all been assigned to someone, right? That's why they're not in the unassigned anymore. I can see who's working on them. I can see which ones are late per the SLA. So this red lightning bolt here is letting us know that this one's late. I can see the tags associated with it, right? If it's a billing issue, if it's for medical records, prescription or requests, I can click on any of my team members emails here… and I can click on any of their emails. I can see all the back and forwards. I can see when the email came in. Any changes that happen. I can respond. If minaj is out here, I can also reassign these, right? If you have permission, there's different permission levels as well. Not everybody can do this. So like if minaj is out, I can just go ahead and reassign these to Cole.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Gotcha.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then once they're done, you just simply move it to the close status here. And then you're going to notice this is going to go from 28 to 27.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  All right. So you just get high level visibility into all the open emails there, and you can see everything that's going on with the team.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, it looks very straightforward. I like it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep, exactly. And really popular too is you can also create custom views as well. So, like for instance, here, if you wanted to create a view, let's just say you handle all the insurance claims, right? We could create a custom view with those insurance claim tags here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. Insurance claim?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I don't have those tags unfortunately, but basically, now, there's a custom view in here that you can easily see. OK, these are all the ones that have insurance claims or if you handle all the general practice ones, then you can also create a custom view for that.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Makes sense. OK?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. That's something that gets asked. Quite, often people want to see, you know, what's the best way to just see these, see those tags. So those custom views. And then, yeah, for each of these folders here, each of these addresses, you have, you know, we can give permission levels to all four of them. You can choose who has access to them. Each one can have different workflows… observations, et cetera.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  OK. What's under the other chat section, there, is that chat underneath the notifications like above the analytics one?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Above the analytics one?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Oh, that's the templates. OK. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There's the templates. Yeah. OK. Yeah, we do have a chat as well that you can put on your site if you, but I don't.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  that's more for like customer facing chat.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Okay. Yep. Exactly. So like… ours looks like this. And then here's the chat, that would just funnel straight into here.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  OK. And then.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then here's the admin side here's. The back end. This is where you add people. This is where you connect the mailboxes. And then you can select the mailbox you want. And then this is where you can set up the custom fields. This is where you can set up the slas, which is super easy. It's like, hey, if nobody responds within 24 hours, we want the following people to get notified. And if it's not completed within 72 hours, we want these people to get notified… and you can do these for specific tags or you can have it for all the conversations in that mailbox.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then the automations here, are it's like, OK, if you receive a new conversation, so a lot of different options there. So a new conversation comes in.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And if in the body of the email, it contains any of the words like invoice taxes… refund, then… we wanted to automatically get assigned to matt and we wanted to automatically add a billing issues tag and you said save.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Okay. Yeah. So, so in terms of like pricing and number of users and whatnot like, is it price per user?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's price exactly. It's price per user and it's sold in buckets of five.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Gotcha. Okay. So if we were to do like let's say a pilot project with one of our shared mailboxes and we had… yeah, like five users, what's the price per? Is there different plans to? I should have probably looked at that more on the website, but.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. No, we can go, we can go over it. It's actually quite easy right now. So we have two products. We have, we have hiver for Gmail, which is our flagship product. And then we have hiver for outlook, which is the one I went over with you, which is, you know, quickly catching up almost half the people that companies that we sign up now are using hiver for outlook and it's we're adding new things every day. But currently we only offer pro for hiver for outlook. So the price, the pricing is 45 dollars a user a month comes with everything we, I showed you today. It also to the AI is a 20 dollar add on per price per user per month. So that's the only add on that we have. And we do sell in buckets of five. So, yeah. So if you can do it annually pay up front or if you want to do month to month, you're looking at like 55 dollars a month a person?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then the other thing is too, we also offer a free seven day trial. So I don't know how long you plan on piloting, but if you need to pilot it more than that, you know, then you could sign up month to month or sign up, but there is a seven day free trial as well.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Perfect. Yeah, I think we would want to at least test it with a few different user accounts.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  And that way we could have an idea of like assigning it, you know, emails to certain users and how that works. OK? Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  OK, awesome. So, yeah, I'll email you this recording. I will email you what we talked about, the resources, the pricing, and did you think that you would want to start like a seven day trial anytime soon? Because what we can do is we can set up a call and I can include one of my solutions engineers to help get that set up as well.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, we did actually try to sign up. I haven't really used the product though because I get to the point of where it says get started with the shared inbox, and then you have to enter, you know, the shared inbox that you want to test with. So we'll just, we'll need to just provision something on our side like an outlook shared mailbox that we can do an initial test with, I guess. And does that start like the seven day kind of trial?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, right. Yeah. My bad, I didn't realize you already had a trial set up. So, yeah, you have a trial set up that's great. Yeah, you just need to get, you need to get permissions from the Microsoft admins for connecting the mailbox. I think that's where you're getting hung up maybe.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah. Well, we just, we can connect an existing one, but I almost just want to test with a test one. Oh, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I see. Yeah. Do you?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Just before we, you know, start granting access to our shared mailboxes, if that makes sense.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, sure. Do you see that? Is there a sample mailbox in there?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Like that we would have on our side?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So basically, yeah, when you sign up, I know this is in our Gmail instance here. When you sign up there's like something called a demo inbox. Oh, I can actually see on my end maybe.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, I'm at the screen here now and this is all I see. So it's sort of forcing me to enter a like an existing mailbox.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Do you mind sharing your screen?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, I'm just, sorry. I just was just gonna, oh, I guess I can't paste an image in there. All right. Oh, yeah, I'll share it.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  There… do you see it now?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I do it's loading. Yep. Okay.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  So, yeah, I want to do an outlook shared mailbox. It's just, yeah, we need to, I don't see an option to just do like a demo.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yep. You'll have to set one up. And then if you just exit this screen here… somehow should let you.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  I just wanted to see if there was a go to.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Your homepage here. I just want to see something.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Just go back to like the hiver one. Yeah, yep.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Do you see it now?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let's try to sign back in or something here. Let's see.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Microsoft.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  see if you can just, I want you to stay in hiver, but just exit the screen. Maybe there's an X on the top right here or something or it doesn't let you do anything. It doesn't let you exit this page, does it?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  No… I don't think so.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Interesting. Okay. Yeah. Maybe you do have to connect something here. So, do you have a shared? So it actually won't affect anything like it really won't affect the mailbox. So, do you have a mailbox that you're interested in connecting? Maybe?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  We do have like the production ones, but like I said, I'd rather just test with a test one. So I'll just, yeah, it's fine. I'll just have to go create a test.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  One. Okay. Yeah, no problem. I see what you're saying now. Okay. Yeah, that's what you'll have to do. Yeah. And we'd be able to just put something on the calendar here like as a follow up to see how it's going.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And I'm going to get your trial extended here a bit as well. That'd be great. Yeah, cause I'm actually going to be out half… of this week here. So let's meet maybe.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  No problem.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We could eat Monday or Tuesday of next week?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And the same time? Okay for you on Monday 12?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Monday would actually be good. Good. Yep. Okay. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let's do that. I'll send you a calendar invite for then on Monday.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Actually, if it's possible to do like a little bit earlier in the day on Monday, that'd be great. I think you're are you on the west coast or?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm PST here.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, I'm on the east coast, so I'm on the.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no problem. I can do, I can do a 12 eastern. Would that work for you?

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay… perfect. Yeah, I would typically do earlier, but full transparency. I'm flying back from my vacation very late Sunday. So I don't want to commit to something too early.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  No, that's totally. I get it. That's totally fine.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, otherwise, I do volunteer myself quite early, but, yeah. Okay. Perfect. Nine o'clock I'll extend it to. Let me just look at your trial real quick. Okay? So we're going to meet on the tenth year, so I can easily just get it extended here to… I'll extend it here till the twelfth year again if you needed a couple more days for whatever reason, no problem. But as long as, you know, we're in communication here. We'll be fine.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Perfect. Thanks a lot.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, thank you so much, Neil. Talk soon bye.

Neil McWilliam (nmcwilliam@bioscript.ca):
  Talk soon. Bye bye.
