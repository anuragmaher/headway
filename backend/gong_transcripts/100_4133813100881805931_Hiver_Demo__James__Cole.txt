Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  yo.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Hey, Cole. Just made your host all you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. Let me know how it goes. Looks good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Bye.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, what's going on James?

James McCarthy (jvmccarthy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Hi. How's it going? Nice to meet you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice to meet you too. And, hey, Andrew.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Hi, Cole. How's it going?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How's it going? Doing well. I appreciate you know, both you hopping on the call here today.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Where are you both based out of?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  We're both in Dublin. What about you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, very cool. I'm based out of New York City.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Very nice. Even cooler some might say.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, you guys got the good Guinness and the good golf over there. I'm jealous of you guys.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  That's it. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I appreciate you know, both, y'all hopping on the call here today, but just to set a quick agenda, you know, would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand both of your roles, what prompted you to reach out to hiver, then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions, but I can kick us off first here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, my name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I'll be your point of contact as you're evaluating this solution. I've been in the email management, client experience space for a little over six years now. And, yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can potentially help y'all.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  thanks a 1,000,000. I'm Andrew, I'm the general counsel of keywords, and you've got James here as well. To answer your question directly. We're… a legal team of about 20 people. We divide ourselves up into three kind of functional groups. So that is reflected in three email addresses. So contracts for client contracts, legal for everything else. And then cosec for company secretarial matters. And it's a high volume and we find it quite difficult to kind of manage the inbox at the moment. It's quite manual where people are either at the start of their day or at the end of the day in whatever time zone are summarizing kind of what's outstanding. Having done a pass through the emails, we have tried unsuccessfully to get service now from ticketing system perspective and Jira, just as another ticketing system off the ground for us. And we found that our customers internally don't necessarily enjoy going outside of their emails to kind of ask services of us. We recently transitioned from o three six five to Google about a month ago. And as part of that, I was at, I asked gem and I for some solutions to our problems and you were one of a few options presented to us. So here we are.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. No. Awesome. That's super helpful. And then James just a quick intro on your side too.

James McCarthy (jvmccarthy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Yeah. So I'm the associate general counsel at keywords. So I work very closely with Andrew on that legal team. Like, so basically, you know, I operate within the same kind of structure he kind of set out there. And yeah, I think like myself and Andrew have been kind of like the head of the team. So like an iPad kind of responsibility for kind of trying to implement other tools in the past. Like Andrew mentioned, we had kind of other ticketing tools like so ServiceNow most recently, and Jira for that. And they didn't kind of, you know, meet our need in terms of like, you know, my functionality or kind of like operational perspective. So yeah, just looking for something now a bit more, you know, easier to use and easier to integrate into our Google workspace which we launched a couple of weeks ago.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, that's super helpful. That gives me a lot of great context for the demonstration here today. So it sounds like you're just looking for a better way to manage these three, you know, shared mailboxes that you have across the organization looking for better collaboration, ticket tracking and all that stuff. And that's exactly, you know, what we do here at hiver. So you definitely came to the right place. We're taking a look at my screen here team. You know, what's nice about hiver is that we are a certified Google partner, right? We live within that Google workspace. So you'll download our solution in five minutes and get up and running within 15, you know, it's a very light lift tool to start using. And on the top right, you'll see hiver settings button, our notification panel, our availability settings. And then on the left, you'll see those shared inboxes that we're managing for you as an organization. So here's a customer success, mailbox, finance, healthcare, operations, support. In this case, let's take a look at the support share mailbox here. For this example. So when I click into this on the left, it's going to open up some sub views beneath it that's going to help us manage the intake of the communications. So the first is the unassigned section, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be delegated via automation or manual assignment. The next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me. And then there's the team view, right? So really just understanding from a high level, what is everyone on the team working on in real time? What's outstanding and what needs to be completed? Want to take a quick pause right here? Any questions so far?

James McCarthy (jvmccarthy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Nope.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. So let's go into the unassigned, right? There's nine emails in the unassigned section. We want to, the goal is to have this to zero. We don't want anything living in the unassigned. So I'm going to click in this email right here for this example. And when I do a tab is going to open up on the right hand side in Gmail called the hiver tab. This can be opened or closed for visibility and it gives us some actions that we can take around the email. The first is assigning it. In this case, I'll assign to myself. Let the team know. I'm going to follow up that's the first way we can assign the work. The next way is a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the conversations amongst the team as they come in. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So identifying emails as they come in by looking at keywords or phrases in the subject line or the body of text, maybe trying to understand which domain is reaching out to us and then routing that specific email to that person who has that skillset. Just curious, James and Andrew, like how ideally would you want the routing to work in your world? Would it be like a round Robin or more of like a skills based approach?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Skills and seniority based?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So kind of like identifying like, you know, requests by the phrases or priority level and stuff like that and routing accordingly.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So something we can 100 percent do, then we can track the status, whether it's like open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks that we're working through conversations to a resolution?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  And can you create different statuses other than open pending and closed, for example, you know, sent to it for review or sent for to DocuSign, something like that. Can you create different statuses?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you would create custom fields for that being like contact reason. So in this, it could be like additional like, you know, additional contact reason you can have like it contract, so on. And so forth, you can customize these values to create those different statuses?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  And then how do you look at those when you're looking back in assigned rather than open pending and closed? How can I see for example, what's with DocuSign? Using that example I gave?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep, 100 percent. So you'll create views for that, right? And you can create different views based on these custom fields and based on these tags right here above. So going into the all views, Andrew like you'll see like these different folders where it's like billing issues, bugs, cancellation escalation, so on and so forth. So you would create these different custom views that you can either have, you know, from an org level or from a personal basis to track those specific requests. Did that answer your question?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Yeah, yeah, please keep going.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. But yeah, 100 percent, you can create those views based on that, and then going back to that conversation, right? We can also do things like collaborate internally. So being able to collaborate with people internally, being like, can you help here? I'll send this notification to matt. He'll receive it up top right here. He'll click on it. It'll take him to this thread where we can keep having that back and forth conversation. Maybe he uses our AI summarizer to get up to speed on the conversation really quickly. He can also see AI sentiment analysis. And we can use this as well to escalate conversations. So our AI sentiment analysis can read through it to see how the client's feeling well, let's say we need more information, right? We also have an AI co pilot to draft responses, so you can feed our co pilot like PDFS, word, docs, website, links to draft replies and help your team find information and respond accordingly.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Yeah, we've enterprise gemini for free as well. So probably that's built into a Gmail too. So probably no need for that from our end.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. But then something where you can just insert in the draft, keep editing it. And then once we've deemed, you know, we've solved this, resolved this email query. We can then throw it in sending closed, which then it will go into the close folder, but just want to pause here. Like what are your thoughts on this so far?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Yeah, kind of as expected, which is good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we do have analytics as well. Is there anything that you'd be looking to glean from an analytics perspective that I can touch on?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Just like I guess as a team like the kind of standard metrics like time to respond, time to resolution, like number of tickets by individuals? So we could see who is and isn't performing. I guess obviously, it might be a bit rough like that. We need to break it down by topic because there's obviously different levels of complexity. But yeah, that would be quite helpful.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For sure. And we can definitely show that. So let's say we want to take a look, take a look at the last nine days of data. We can see active new resolve conversations over that time period. What our average first response time was the team or average resolution time and then break it down from an individual basis. So emails assigned per user, email sent out per user, and then their individual performance metrics. Like, hey, what was Cole's average first response time over the last nine days? And what was my average resolution time over the last nine days? So kind of stack ranking the team?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then breaking it down by conversation type, you know, active new resolve conversations based on tag and the workload associated below. So these are kind of the out of the box of the ports, the tags, users contacts, you know, service level agreements. These are all out of the box, but then you can also create custom reports as well to slice and dice that data further, you know, based on assignees tags, custom fields, and so on. And so forth.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the last portion is the admin panel where we're going to set up the platform, right? Like we are a platform, we do offer engagement over different channels like email chat, whatsapp, voice, knowledge base, and a customer portal where people can log in and track their tickets. This is where we'll set up the automations, integrations, and all that good stuff. But clicking on the shared mailboxes, right? I'll go to the support shared mailbox for this example. So I know you said you have three. So every mailbox can have its own, you know, set of tags, custom fields, users, it's its own entity essentially that you'll create settings around. So for this support mailbox, these are all the users who have access. This is where we'll create those custom fields. So if you want to create, you know, that dropdown where it's like, you know, contact reason… and it's like, you know, maybe it's like with like legal.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Billing maybe it's in the contract phase, whatever that might be. So you can use those views and that will live on the right hand side to kind of track, you know, who it's going with and who's working through it. And then we can do things like automation. So when… if then functionality like for instance, this is one where it's like new conversation comes inbound. We've identified in the subject line, the body of text that there's the keywords urgent, business critical and stop working. We're then going to add the tag urgent issued. So it goes to the urgent view and then assign it to Raghav specifically because he deals with these types of requests. So just a workflow builder to streamline, you know, assignments, sending automated replies and a bunch of these different actions right here. Any questions on these automations?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  No, I'd love to hear whenever you're done, just talk through your different pricing models as well, just to understand that and, how you kind of how we could test it as well because we're obviously speaking to a couple of others?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. When would you offer a free trial? And then the last thing I'll touch on is the slas, and then we'll hop into pricing is tracking first response times and resolution times and you can have different slas based on different tags. So let's say it's an L1 escalation.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We're going to have a first response goal of 30 minutes and a resolution goal of 24 hours. If we're not able to hit these metrics, you can choose you notify to escalate this conversation.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Okay. That's good. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then in terms of pricing, so for what you'd be looking for, I'd recommend the pro plan… and how many users would you need?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  20?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  20? Okay. Yeah. The pro plan that gives you up to five shared mailboxes that you can manage it, gives you up to 20 automations that I just showed you before and a bunch of other things like csat surveys, business hours, load… balancing and additional analytics. So that would be 45 dollars per user per month. And that's just list that's for an annual commitment for 20 users. I could definitely work on making more cost effective.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Talk me through the difference between that and growth.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you wouldn't be able to do growth because growth is capped at 10 users.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And we do offer a free trial as well.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And that's typically what I recommend for a next step is to, you know, get your team's hands on the platform. So when would be a good time for you all to reconnect to kick off a trial?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  We're just talking to gmelius and front as well. Along with our it procurement team. We're looking at a few other providers. So we'll probably touch base with you when we're ready to go. We just need to complete that exercise first.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. Would it be okay to put like just a tentative trial kickoff for same time next week to give you some time to do your demos? We can like do it at a later date?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  No, no, we'll definitely come back to you. We will come back either way, but we definitely don't want to March to, we need to do our work first and our homework on that topic. What do you think are, your kind of usps, like as a provider versus any of the competitors?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I'd say for us like one we're compared to front. Like our, one of the key differentiators off the bat is just we're Gmail native. So front is a separate application you're going to have to log into. So that's one off the bat. Two, you're going to get a dedicated customer success manager from us. So someone to help you implement, train your team, get up and running successfully. So I think that is also a big differentiator from us as well. And then our AI capabilities are cutting edge. And then on top of that, our technical support team. So on top of a customer success manager, you'll have access to a technical support team who's available 24 seven three six five. And then also that we're just a platform. So compared to gmelius, like we can ingest data, we can bring it into the Google workspace. So I think just the breadth of our platform goes pretty deep into Google.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  And can you talk me through that just in more detail? The implementation piece? Do you just hand over the free trial to us? And we like how does it work in terms of support for us as a team to get this off the ground?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we're if you kick off a trial and we provide a kickoff call with you to train you on it, get you up and running, set you up for success to test. Then if you deem you want to move forward with hiver, from there, I will assign you a customer success manager who's actually going to scope out your use case, build automations with you and ensure a successful kickoff. And it typically takes about a week, OK?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  And can you, and we're obviously in the business, it's very security content focus. Can you talk us through your kind of security posture and certifications? Because it's something if we come along, to our it team even looking to test, they'll be very keen to get their eyes on.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we're iso soc, two hipaa compliant. Like all those major ones, we work with a lot of financial banks and health care clients who have sensitive data. So from a privacy and security perspective, we have all of those standard certifications.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  And none of our data, our emails will be ingested by you to be used for training your own models, AI, models, et cetera.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's correct. So, we're not doing anything with your emails.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  And are you a Chrome extension? Is that how you kind of import, into the system here?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That is correct. So we're a Chrome extension. You can download us in like five minutes.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Excellent.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But just based on our call, does it seem like this is something you would want to trial just based on our call today?

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Yeah, look as I said, we're going to kind of look at, kick the tires on a few different providers and then make a decision about which we want to test out. We're probably going to test out one or two max to be honest. So, yeah, we'll definitely be in touch call at some point.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. If you do end up wanting to test us and gmelius, you just can't test us at the same time because we're you know, we're both living in that workspace, it's going to be some crossover, just something to keep in mind.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no matter. But I can follow up the proposal for 20 users as well with the discount that would be associated with it, some other information that you can review in the meantime. But if there's any other questions, feel free to let me know. Looking forward to potentially kicking off the trial.

James McCarthy (jvmccarthy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, thanks very much. Awesome. Yeah, it'd be good to know what the financial structure looks like.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 100 percent. So, I'll follow up with all that information team. It was great to meet you both. And I'll talk with you all soon.

Andrew Kennedy (akennedy@keywordsstudios.com):
  Thanks so much, Cole, appreciate it. Have a good day. Take care guys, bye.
