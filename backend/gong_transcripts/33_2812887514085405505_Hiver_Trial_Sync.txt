Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on, Joe?

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  I'm good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How are you? Nice. I appreciate you hopping on here. Will Chris be joining us today? Yeah, I'm.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, perfect. Perfect. Hey, how's it going? Chris, pretty?

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Good. Pretty good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good. Yeah. Just wanted to serve this call up team, wanted to see how everything was going with the trial. And then, you know, we can just kind of take it from there.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Yeah, everything seems to be going pretty good with the trial. Like, I know I've chatted with your support. A couple of times. We've been like really responsive, so that's been really helpful.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. No, that's great to hear. So just kind of curious from your perspective team, does it seem like you want to move forward? Like with hiver and sign up for a plan?

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  It makes sense. I'm just like the other day, I had a question because you kind of said like different accounts have different shared accounts or something like that. So I was a little confused by that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Which was this?

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  I think you were saying like different, I guess different tiers for you. I can include like, you know, five shared accounts or one shared account?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can go over the, yeah, so I can go over the pricing real quick. So… the growth plan offers up to three shared inboxes. The pro offers up to five, and then the elite offers up to unlimited shared mailboxes, and then the growth gives you 15 automations. The pro gives you 20 automations, and the elite is unlimited. And then there's different features and functions that come within each?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Do you know how many shared mailboxes, would you need as a team?

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  That's something that me and Chris were talking about like right now, ideally, it's like customer service like the sales box. And then we were thinking about something for invoicing or accounting.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So that would be like three?

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Yes. Yeah, that would be like, right? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, if it's three shared mailboxes that you'll be managing the growth package will work for y'all.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Great. And then I saw when I was using the app like customer portal, can you like show a little bit of that and like demo that a little bit?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 100 percent one second here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Let's pull this up and we're good. So the customer portal, it's a place where, you know, clients can log in, authenticate via Google. They're signed in whatever it is to submit and track their tickets.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We can say with Google… okay, there we go. Yeah. So this is the portal, right? So I'm logged in to my authenticated login and here, I can track my requests. So tickets that I have with your business, I can click on this. I can actually have a conversation from here as well… and you can track how long ago it was created, the id, the status stuff like that. And then we can also submit requests. So going back home here, you know, just go in here. You can submit requests. You can have different optional dropdowns and things of that nature.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  How does that come in? Like, I guess that's the customer side, how would we see that on ours?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it would come in like an email. So it all comes in the email format. Let's see.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So it'll come into the shared mailbox basically in like a Gmail form. Let me just see if it pops up here. I actually don't think I have access to that mailbox in this, but.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I don't have permissions to the mailbox, so it's not visible to me here, but it went to like a sandbox mailbox. I just can't review it in my hiver because I don't have access… but essentially, it would just come in like standard email format and, you know, you can test this as well on the trial.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  And then when you say automations, like what exactly for you guys is an automation?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So an automation is?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You know, rule based automations like these. So being able to do things, let's say, you know, new email comes in and we've identified in the body of text and the subject line of the email that there's the keywords, urgent business critical, stopped working. We're then going to add the tag urgent issue to organize it and put it in the urgent issue queue and then assign it to Raghav.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Sorry, what'd you say?

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Could it be done? Let's say, you know, like you're using those keywords, but could it be any keywords that we set up?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. This is all customizable. So this is just the example I created, but, you know, this can be like billing quote request, whatever it might be.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you can kind of pick and choose how you want to set it up. And so with the growth, you'll get 15 of these.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  And that's with, is that with the words or is that with tabs?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Per shared mailbox. So it's just this workflow right here. So this will be with the words this entire flow. You're seeing that's one automation.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Any questions or anything else that I can help clarify?

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Do you guys like save attachments automatically or is that something I would have to do if you're like zapier or third party?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Saving like saving it to like Google drive or something? Yeah, yeah, that's not something we do today.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And is there anything else that I can clarify that I, or the support team hasn't but it does seem like you want to move forward with the growth plan just based on what we discussed?

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Yeah, it seems like the growth plan would be where we would start out of.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. So let me see here. Let me see when your trial… is running out. We also do sell in buckets of five. So like five, 10 15, 20 when partnering with new businesses.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  So that would mean we would need to pay for five accounts.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I can provide, you know, a 10 percent discount off the top of the service since you would be paying for a couple additional licenses. So just to save you some cost on that front.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And I see the trial is running until the seventeenth. So what I can do is team, I can update the pricing on the back end of your account and will you be signing up for an annual or month to month commitment? So the month to month is 35 dollars per user and the annual is 25.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  I think we would start off with the month to month.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I'll provide a 10 percent discount off of the month to month commitment on the back end of your admin panel. And when you're ready, you can go in and update your credit card, and the discount will reflect when you sign up for the month to month.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Is there anything else that I can help with or clarify in the meantime team?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No. Okay, perfect. So I will do that right now, but I appreciate you know, the time today team and we're looking forward to getting you up and running. Once you do sign up, we do offer some, you know, implementation calls with one of my solution specialists. So if you want to get on a call, you know, once you sign up, we're happy to offer that as well.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Thank you guys. So much. I'll talk to you all soon and we're looking forward to the partnership.

Joseph Bayer (joseph@cabsignsinc.com):
  All right, cool. Appreciate your time. Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Thank you guys. Take care.
