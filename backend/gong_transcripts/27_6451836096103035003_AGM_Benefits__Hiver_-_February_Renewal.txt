================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Alice. How's it going?

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  Hi, going well. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm good. I'm just a bit under recovery with the flu. So I'm going to be video off, but otherwise.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  Oh, my goodness, that flu is going around.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Tell me about it. Sometimes it gives me corona PTSD but I don't want to say that out loud. I know.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  He's going to be video.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  Off, and I'm going to be voice off, Alice, I've lost my voice. This is not how I usually sound but considering Raghav's point, I just want to quickly introduce I'm Pavitra and I'm the customer success manager for AGM benefits and I'll be taking it forward from here. Raghav is going to be the account manager today. We're going to entirely focus on renewal, but after that, I'd like to set up a follow up with your guys when my voice is all cleared out and talk about how you currently use hiver.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  Sounds like a great plan. Yeah, I think today, let's focus on the renewal and the pricing and then we'll have further calls as needed.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect, definitely. Thanks for that, Pavitra. I didn't realize your situation was worse than mine so appreciate you still showing up, Alice. We've got Emily as well. Hey, Emily. How's it going? Hey?

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  I'm good. How are y'all,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  all good. All good as you can see different types of sickness if I could call it that in different stages of recovery.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Hope y'all, feel better soon. I know it's going around everywhere.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly. So on that note of everybody recovering, well, quick introductions, I'm Raghav folks, I will be the account manager and point of contact going forward. I'll be partnering alongside Pavitra in the long run for the most part. I will be an added and, you know, a resource that's mostly backup and I'll take the lead when it comes to commercials growth. And in this case, pricing and renewal in a general sense of it. So, pleasure meeting everybody today. And Alice and Emily, the primary agenda today was just pure commercials in terms of understanding the renewal for us telling you in terms of, hey, you know, this is the kind of price point we're looking at for the renewal. And what I want to kick it off with is in terms of the inclination for the AGM benefits business on a multi year contract to sort of continue the… discussion from here.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Okay, great.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yep. So heading, I mean, leading into today's, call, we, did, you know, have a discussion with our leadership and what we do have approval for is a price lock on your current rates.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  If you're open to a two or three year long term contract with hiver, and if not, we would be looking at a price increase around, the,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  okay. So in case a multi year contract might not be realistic, we would be looking at a price increase in the 65 dollar range for the upcoming one year renewal. The reason for the price increase is primarily driven by, the inclusion and the influx of features that we've launched especially over the last couple of quarters. And yes, features are part of existing tiers and we're not selling it as metered separate AI functionality. Like the rest of the market is doing right now. Instead, we've basically rolled it in as part of the respective tiers, the different types of features and functionality that we have. And so that's effectively the kind of lens that we're coming into this discussion with. So, yeah, what I wanted to understand was a, are multi year contracts, something you do as a business with other vendors or would you be open to doing that with hiver and B from an AI perspective? What does your roadmap and expectations look like as a business as well for AI?

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  Okay. So, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly, we would be locked into the rate that we're at. Now, if we signed up, I couldn't it broke up when you were saying the contract, how many years?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So we can do a two year contract at the current rate price lock, no future price increases till that expires, it will be a two year contract.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  Okay. And then if we aren't ready to commit… on a two.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Year, you would be looking at an increase in cost to a 65 dollar per person per month as the price reach,

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Okay.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  65 per person? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  65 usd per person per month.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  An increase or is that 65 dollars? What are we paying now? I don't even know.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  I'm trying to pull it up and it won't refresh. I was trying to see our plans our.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Bill, let me get that going real quick. I think you're paying us at around 40 dollars per vitro, hold me right here… the.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  Current pricing, yep.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  53 dollars. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  A person?

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  Right now, and if we don't sign the two year contract, we go up to 65 per person.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  12 dollars per person increase. You've got about 26 active users. So the second change that also happens is we have as a business moved to tiered pricing which means it's going to be buckets of five in terms of user additions and increments. Now, a couple of pointers that I want to tell you is first you are on a monthly contract with hiver, or have been on an annual contract with a monthly billing on hiver. Sorry, I'm correcting myself annual contract, you pay the invoices monthly, but you're signed up for the whole year. So if you're open to a two year renewal and we're open to being the same flexibility on payment terms. So it'll be a two year contract. You make the invoice payments month over month. We're happy to continue offering hiver at 53 for a total of 30 users because that'll be your tier. And if a multi year contract is not feasible or possible, we would be looking at a 65 usd per person per month cost for a total of 30 users on the payment terms. We can retain the same one which is one year annual contract paid monthly or two years, annual contract paid monthly. We're open to being that flexible considering the partnership so far.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  Okay. Full transparency. I don't think we're going to be looking for a two year contract. Nothing against hiver. We love the tool. We use it. Just a lot of changes going on within AGM, and I don't feel comfortable making the two year commitment at this point. Not that I'm not saying we won't, be here for another 10 years, but just some technology changes. I'm sure you're seeing that everywhere. So I… would feel what would happen if we needed to get out of our contract earlier than in the two years. And for some reason, if we decide to move forward two years contract, what if we decide within a year that we needed to cancel the contract?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Now because it is going to be an annual or two year contract, a long term contract. Basically, you would still be liable or owing hiver the contract price in itself. Okay? Functionality, stopping the using or stopping usage of the software, you're free to do that, you can uninstall hiver, delete it and remove all people and everything. But commercially, you would still be committed to making that full payment. Okay?

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  That makes sense. I understand that. Okay. Can you do me a favor and send this to me in an email?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Of course, definitely.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  With the breakdown and again, we love hiver, nothing that y'all are doing is not the reason we wouldn't want to secure it all. I don't just, there's just a lot. So let's move. If you don't mind send us an email, I.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  will do.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  That, yeah, we'll discuss and we'll get an answer to you quickly.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Makes total sense. And, you know, if it is a one year contract, do you think that increase of about 12, 13 dollars, 12 dollars to be precise? Do you think that might be a hurdle an obstacle in terms of getting approval and things like that?

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  It could be. And that's why, you know, we're looking at right now if we do the two year contract, that would be almost 1,400 dollars annually. Where this is, if you don't it's close to 1,700 dollars. So that's you know, a chunk difference. Is there any wiggle room in the 65… I?

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Would just jump in here. I'm seeing and I understand y'all are changing the billing structure. So maybe this is not an option, but I see that. I guess, I think the last time we renewed, I guess a year ago, we did move to, I think prior to a year ago, I guess we might have just been on a month to month thing, but I think we moved to the one year contract to get a 10 percent discount. And that's why we're at the 53 whatever a month because it was, it looks like it was 50 59 dollars a user. And currently we have 26 users. So 59 a user and then minus the 10 percent discount that's where, you know, or that's where it gets us. So, yeah, I guess just throwing it out there. If we did just do the year where it goes up to the 65. Could we still get that 10 percent discount for signing a year? Or?

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  Just.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  no, that's a fair question. Emily, I will be transparent from the history that I've dug through.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I haven't been able to notice any past conversations in terms of pure emails. So I will be chatting or just digging deeper into this internally. But just at the offset to set the right expectations, we haven't been discounting for teams under 50 users just in terms of the conversations I've had so far.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  At the same time, I think I might be able to get you all the way down to 60 like a five dollar discount per person. Just considering you've been with us for a while, you've got about almost 30 users give or take, and that 30 is your renewal tier in itself. I think I might be able to get you down to 60 per person on a business. Obviously, the preference would be a multi year contract. But if not, we do look at just the one year renewal for now. Best case pricing is the only blocker. I think I can get you down to 60. So that would be a seven dollar increase per person. So for like 30 people that's the tier that's going to be a 210 increase, one year contract, paid monthly. Everything else stays the same instead of 65. It would be 60. So if you tell me now that 60 might get better approval and has a chance of a quicker approval on your end, I can drive that internally and make sure you get that 60 and use that as the price point on the renewal quote. If that makes sense?

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Okay. Yes, good information to know. And that sounds like that might be more in our, what we can handle.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And because.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Of the changes, so we would be locked into that 30 user bucket. Obviously, I'm sure if we went over then it would be upped. So what, is it increments of five? Is that what you said for users?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Because, yeah.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Sorry, I will say we have a couple of users… to be fully transparent. We currently have 23 full time employees. So a couple of users do need to be deleted. So with that being said, we could be in the 25 user bucket. I'm guessing. Yeah. So we would just need to delete those users before the renewal to make sure we would lock into that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's about it. So, if you're clear on that you would be at or below 25, then I'll just go back to the team, work up the quote accordingly, okay, and lock you in for like 60 usd. Okay? But I'll also send you, the auto form or the quote for the two year at 53, sure just for reference and internal rules and, you know, whichever one makes sense, would love to go for it. But looks like it's 60 per person, 25 people for one year from what I'm hearing. Yeah.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Yeah, that's probably what we're going to go with. But yeah, you feel free to send us just the other number. So we have it for reference. But yes, thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I do have a question deleting accounts.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, for.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  example, I'm.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  assuming.

Alyce Faucheux (alyce.faucheux@agmbenefits.com):
  I don't know, Emily, tell me if I'm wrong, but I was Elyse, Io, and then now I'm Elyse.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Foshay, I think I already deleted you. No, I think I took care of that. I need to check, but my admin panel is not working right now. So I'm going to have to check when I can get it working. But yeah, I think I took care of that. Elyse. I think I made sure that all your Io ones were closed and so they wouldn't reopen for you or move. Anyway. I did what I had to do to delete people. Yeah, we've been through this song and dance before deleting. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm going to take it as a sign that both of you are clear between the two of you. But if there are any leading questions and outstanding questions, feel free to put it in an email. Send it over me and provitra will make sure we clear that out as well.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Perfect. And.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  just to reconfirm, I think your renewal is on the fourth, make sure I get the right number, I think.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  It's February fifth the next Thursday.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So you've still got some time. So leading up to that, any questions, let us know for now? I'm going to put you down for 60 dollars per person, 25 people, one year contract, annual, paid monthly, get that worked up sent over. I'd still send the two year contract just for visibility and Elyse, but it looks like we're going to be good to lock in at 60 per person. OK, anything else folks?

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Elyse, anything? I think I'm good. Nothing over here. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, brilliant. So before I let you go to provitra's point, we would love to set up some time for later, probably after the fifth of February to walk you through some of the additional functionality you will get as part of this renewal and increase cost. One of the immediate increases is that you're going to go from 20 rule based automations to 30 rule and AI based automations. And there's also like a whole AI co pilot that we've built out that a lot of teams in your space have found use with hiver. So I let provitra send you an email with her scheduler and parallel to renewal, you can just put some time in advance on her calendar and that way we can continue optimizing with the new functionality for you. Sure.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  We'll probably loop in. There are two other team members that are probably going to be the right ones to be on that call instead of me and Elyse, just based on roles and direct reports and everything their team, you know. So yes, definitely feel free to shoot us an email with that availability and I'll loop in the right people to coordinate with and they would be the ones to most benefit, you know, from that call.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Thanks for that. Provitra and everybody else that's it for today from the hiver site, pleasure chatting with both of you. Look for my order form, both the options before the end of the day today. And yeah, if it's easier over DocuSign after you've gotten approval, things like that, let me know and we can just make this process quick. Perfect.

Emily Melancon (emily@agmbenefits.com):
  Thank you all so much appreciate it. Have a good day. Bye.
