Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Charlie. How are you?

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Yeah. Can you hear me now?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Now, I can hear you. How are you doing?

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  I'm doing good.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Great. I think I have my colleague Manoj joining as well.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  I know we scheduled a meeting today to go over the trial period and all the options and stuff.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  We've been testing, we've… been testing system, hold on. Let me see why is this, keep on switching. Can you hear me now?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. I can hear you.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  It keeps on switching to my regular speakers of bluetooth. I'm not sure why, but anyway, so we did the testing… on the system. You know, there's definitely a lot of things need to be set up which I know you guys stated you would help like with the setup and stuff, but I didn't want to go too deep without doing this meeting first. I don't want to waste too much time.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  So in term of the pricing, I got your email. Yeah, I did take it to finance. I spoke to them. They did notice… and they want me to clarify this with you. So they noticed the AI is not included and that's an additional price.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that is correct.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  So that's not included even on the highest package?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, that's that comes as an add on, Charlie. So any plan that you choose it would come as an add on if you choose to opt that it's going to cost you 20 dollars per user per month. But of course, we can extend the same discount as we have done on any plan that you choose. So the pricing that I shared was for the pro plan at 35 percent off. So the similar discount.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Last time we agreed, not the pro plan, the elite. We said we're going to go with the higher price. We thought we were going to go with the higher plan. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And that was primarily to accommodate your six shared mailboxes that you're looking for, right? But the budget that you shared with me, which was about, so I was not able to get that much of discount on the elite plan to take it down to 35 dollars from the price listed, which is 75. Hence we, I tried to accommodate the six shared mailboxes within the pro plan itself and be able to get it to 30 dollars as we discussed.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Yeah, that's not going to work for us. So we needed the set hours for the KPIs, we needed there's a couple of things we needed from the elite. So everything else?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is there in the pro plan? Is there anything specific that you want in elite? I think everything that we discussed, everything is there in the elite in the pro plan already?

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  The specific hours this wasn't in the pro plan it?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is there in the pro plan as well? So there is not much difference in the pro and the elite is usually picked by larger enterprise teams wherein there are, there is a need of let's say creating a lot of shared mailboxes across different individuals. So since you mentioned that you're looking at six mailboxes and pro was just right there at five. So we accommodated six within this plan itself with all the functionalities that you need. Is there anything specific that I am missing out on? Are you looking at more than six mailboxes that would only be… there in the elite plan? Because the set hours and business hours and everything is there in the pro as well?

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  I would have to go back and check. I am not sure to be honest with you at this point. I know we spoke last time to do the elite at the 35. So I didn't really, I don't really dig deep into the comparison… so that's basically what's going on. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what's the difference between the two. I know we need to integrate with Asana, we need to integrate with Salesforce. We need to do… the multiple mailboxes. I thought the AI was included in the elite as well, but my, all my finance team, they're like that's a separate add on. And they weren't too happy about this because drag, what we tested initially is drag is 25 dollar and that's include the AI. So they asked me why are we going with hiver and not continuous drag? So that's basically where we stand right now. And, you know, because drag already have the AI included and they're much cheaper and they extend discount on top of the actual price. So, you know, I'm saying this, it's completely different… like the difference in the price is going to be more than double. So that's I don't think they're going to approve this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I completely understand. Would you mind sharing like the quotes that you have received from drag including AI functionalities for you if?

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  You go on there and just open their websites right over there. I don't have to share anything. You can. It's public if you go to drag. Com and you look up, their highest plan is 24 dollar and that's include unlimited AI, unlimited this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Think to share with you. It's it's all over there already.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. I mean, of course, there's a huge difference between the pricing and, you know, yeah.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  We're talking about even at 35, even at 35 for the pro plan plus 20 that's 55 dollars versus less than 20 dollars in drag. So it's double the amount.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  It's more than that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And AI is something that you absolutely need because last time I think we did not discuss on that. We were, we were OK to let go of the AI as an add on. So, is that something that you're absolutely looking at? Is it a must have for you?

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  I mean, it's better, yeah, because it doesn't make sense. The system without it. I mean, it's kind of like it does function to the shared mailbox, but it doesn't there's a lot of tagging, a lot of things that's it will improve with the AI. Obviously, you know what I'm saying? That, the suggested action, the reply suggestion reply, there's a lot of there's a lot of things. I mean, it will probably speed up the process and help the team, you know? And again, we need to test it. I'm not sure how sophisticated the AI system integration on your end. But mostly AI integration. Usually they're great. So that's basically what's going on.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, could you tell me or could you share the last like sort of budget that has been approved by finance? Because of course, it'll be difficult for us to exactly match the pricing that you're getting from track because in terms of the support, the maturity of the product, a lot of things you will see as a difference between the two platforms as you start using it. But that is something that, I do not want to sort of quote in terms of, you know, giving you a comparison in that sense, but it is something.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  So initially when we spoke, sorry to cut you off initially when we spoke about elite and we said 35, I thought this include the AI. So you're saying the AI is not included and you can't even do 35 on elite, I mean that's kind of like that's kind of like right over there, it's just, you know, I'm saying that the approved budget is what I submitted initially from drag. They approved this. So you asked me for the approved budget, what I submitted based on the initial evaluation… for drag, that was definitely approved. And I understand you can't match it. But at the 35, I mean that's still 15 dollars higher than drag and.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think I understand. So Charlie, maybe there might have been some confusion and I apologize for that. But based on our discussion, I did not promise any price to you since I was just trying to understand what we could do. And of course, I did pitch the elite plan as well internally at 35, but unfortunately I did not get the approval to, you know, go up to 50 percent on that plan since it's our higher tiered plan, right? So since we required six shared mailboxes, so, I got the approval to accommodate that within the pro plan itself. Now, of course, since you also need AI. And even if I look at the pro plan which is going to be now 65 dollars. And on that, if we do like 35 percent or 40 percent, it's still going to be costing you about 40 dollars per user per month.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Yeah, which is not there, did not approve this. So they're not going to approve this because we still need the Google plan as well. We can't eliminate the Google plan. So it's we're paying for the Google licenses.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Plus we're paying for hiver, which is, it adds up to the point where it's not worth it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So what I can do as the last thing and then you can tell me if this is something you would like to take forward since you already mentioned that 35 dollars is something that you might be able to consider. So we can do the pro plan including the AI at 35 dollars per user per month. If that is something that you would like to consider, we can then sort of take this evaluation forward. What do you think?

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  The pro plan including the AI?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  So, what's the difference? So, what's the difference? What's the main difference between the pro plan and elite? Because I don't want to say yes, and then start using it and find more things that's oh, that's not included. Oh, yeah, that's elite. You know what I'm saying? So, can you scroll down? What is, what are the main differences?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  See the main difference that you will notice is going to be in terms of being able to.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Let's do one. Let's do one by one, just sorry. So if you go, if you scroll up, let's do the first thing that's not included. What is this last thing on here, skills based auto assignment? So, what is this exactly?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  See, it's going to take a lot of time if we go to each functionality one by one. So what I can sort of, you know, help you understand from a broader perspective in terms of the functionality. So there will be key things that will be missing in the elite plan, and that's going to be in your usage limits, right? In terms of the usage limits, as you know, elite plan accommodates unlimited shared mailboxes. So you can actually set up more than six shared mailboxes in elite, which is not there in the pro. And then you have certain limitations in terms of how many automations you can create. So the automations that we discussed like these are the automations that you have. So in the pro plan, you would have a limit to set up to 20 automations here, right? So if you think that 20 automations are going to be more than enough for your team, then I think pro plan will suffice your needs there. So these would be the limitations from the basic functionalities point of view, right? And of course, then comes the support wherein you have certain key differences in terms of the dedicated success manager. But this is something we can still accommodate in the pro plan wherein we can help you with the onboarding assistance, give you a respective account manager, who can, you know, help you with your journey with hiver. So we can accommodate these things within this plan itself. So the key difference that you will see is going to be in the number of shared mailboxes and having limit on the automations which is up till 20, which mostly suffice for the team size that you have, which is about 25 people.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So yeah, these would be the key differences apart from it from the analytics integrations perspective. I don't see that you'll be missing out on anything. You would have these functionalities as well in your pro plan. So almost everything is there.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Yeah. I would have to go back to my team and I would have to go back to my team. I mean, so you're saying you can do the pro?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  For 35 dollars?

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  And that's include the AI?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can share the proposal with you as well over the email so that you can get it run by the finance team. And then you could let me know if you'd like to proceed and whatever the feedback is from your side.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that's fine. I mean, if you can share this with me, I'll in the meantime, I'll look for the differences between the two plan. What is the skill? So, because that's something I think we were looking into, the skill assignment… whatever, can you elaborate a little bit on this line item? Because I think that's one of the things we were looking at as well.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Hi, Charlie. Let me take this up, Manoj from the pre sales team.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Hey, what's going on? Manoj? How are you?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So the skill based assignment is basically let's say that you.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Have.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  people who handle billing queries, or who handle, you know, any kind of technical queries, and you have like a bunch of people handling like three or four members.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Right. Yeah. You.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Can set up an automation based on keywords, subject line, body, email addresses and do an action called assign amongst three or four different people. So what it does is.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  that's… the one we spoke about last time and that's something we must have. So, so that's definitely something we spoke about last time that's why I wanted to touch base on this because, we do need like if it's a coming from this email, it has to be assigned to this two team member. If it's coming from this email address need to be assigned to this two team members. So, so that's something we definitely that's why last time we spoke about elite versus pro because there's a lot of key points one.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Small clarification here. Charlie. Again, the email is still going to be assigned to one single person, the assign amongst what it does is it manages the workload as well. Like if the person a has like five emails already, they're working on. And if person B has like 10 emails, the new email will get assigned to person a.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Yeah, right. Yeah, I understand. Okay, I understand what you're saying. It's it's basically, you have, so, so the email when it comes in, it's based on the skills that get assigned. So, I do get this part. Oh,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  yeah. So you can still set it up for each person, each individual here, right? Or on the keywords, you can still sort of assign it to one person at a time. Am I right? Manoj?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that is that assigned to is the single person?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You can assign it based on the, you know, skills. This is what we discussed as well. The last time what is not going to be available is I think the assign among functionalities, yeah, where you can assign between different individuals, right? Based on one condition. So this is something that, is this something that you would want to have?

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Yeah, that's the one we spoke about, that's why I touched base on this specific point. That's something we definitely would, that's something we definitely would need to have.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay, perfect. I understand. So if I will check that internally, I'll discuss it and then I can confirm it to you over the email as to what's the best possible price that we can do in elite, and then I can revert and then we can accordingly proceed.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Okay. No problem. Let me know. Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  All right. Perfect. No worries. Shalvi. Thank you for your time.

Charlie Solta (csolta@cdsrepairs.com):
  Thank you very much.
