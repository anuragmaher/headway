Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  how's it going? Hey?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Kolter? How you doing?

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Living the dream man? How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good man. Good. Let me just pull up some stuff here real quick.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome, man. Well, appreciate you joining. My name is matt senior account executive here at hiver agenda for the call today. Wanted to just spend the first couple minutes or so learning a little bit more about you, your company. I know you sent over some information here as well. Appreciate that. And then from there, I can tell you a bit about hiver and then walk you through our product and answer any questions that you have. Sound good?

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Yeah, sounds great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, yeah. Hey, Kolter, I see that you're the director of data and operations over there. Tell me a little bit about kind of maybe what interested you in taking this meeting?

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Yeah. I guess… the biggest thing is I'm always looking for ways for my teams to be more efficient, trying to make their lives easier, give them the best tools and resources. Honestly, I'd never heard of hiver before. Y'all reached out, but I'm always willing to hear people out and see if it's a good fit and if it's something that really would benefit my teams and help them to serve our customers and do their jobs more effectively with less manual work or human error. I'm always interested in something like that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. Yeah, definitely. That's definitely what hiver does, if it's a fit your company, do you guys use outlook or use Gmail?

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Outlook?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Outlook. Okay. Nice. Okay. Got it. So really where hiver shines is with shared email addresses. Does your team or any of the teams that you know of use a lot of shared email addresses like infoad, supportad, anything like that?

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Yeah, we have several of those.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. And then are you using any type of help desk? Currently? I think you mentioned that you're using Hubspot and servicehub?

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Yeah. So, servicehub is the help desk platform within Hubspot. The whole company recently transitioned to it. So everyone is now using servicehub in Hubspot,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  got it. Got it. So recently, yes. Okay. Awesome. And you're not using any like Zendesk or anything like that as well?

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  So, we were on Zendesk and Freshdesk previously, got it. Yeah. So that's why we moved to consolidate everybody into one platform.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Zendesk and Freshdesk, and then went to Hubspot. Makes sense. Yep, exactly. Yeah. Hiver's part of this, that industry there. So, yeah, we bring people over from these… different vendors for different reasons. But yeah, especially Zendesk, Freshdesk, and then, yeah, using Hubspot as well. We have integration with Hubspot, but yeah, hiver is fairly, it's different, but it accomplishes the same thing. A little bit about hiver. We're an AI customer service, help desk platform, over 200 employees, over 2000 customers in over 50 countries, teams using our platform ranging from small businesses up to some of the largest companies in the world, companies like capital one, companies like flexport, different healthcare companies as well. And really, you know, what people are struggling with before coming to hiver, is it's very clear to who's handling these emails a lot to poor collaboration across these emails. You need to forward them, CC them, manually, route these emails, tag them. There's no unified view of past conversations. Hard to track the response times. And then the impact of hiver is just, you know, faster response times, deflecting these tickets that you're getting consistently consistent on brand communication, faster ramp up times, reduction of manual efforts, and then just smarter support operations across the team. So, yeah, I'll get into it here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Can you see my screen? Yep. Awesome. So hiver is a web application. You're just going to simply log in using your Microsoft credentials. And then what you're going to see here on the left is these folders, and each of these folders is connected to a shared email address or multiple shared email addresses. Okay? And you have different departments, you can share certain folders with certain departments, whoever you want to give access to and restrict access to other people there. And then essentially, whenever an email comes in, it comes into the unassigned folder here. You're going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can go ahead and assign it out to each other. As soon as you assign work to someone, they get notified. We have different statuses open pending closed. So you can see the status of all these tickets. We have different tags. These are custom tags that you can put. We have automation so that these emails and tags can get automatically applied based on keywords based on domains. We have custom fields here. These could be drop down fields, text fields, anything custom that you're looking to track. And then down here is the notes section where you can put notes, you hit the add mention button. Everyone's name in the account pops up and it's like, hey, Kol, can you help on this? And then Kol, there would get notified. And then you can have that kind of internal communications directly with the email right here.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. And then you can reply to the email directly in here. We have email templates set up. So for those kind of reoccurring emails that you might get, we have different AI features like AI chat gpt where you can fix the grammar, fix the spelling. And we also have something called an AI copilot which can actually draft replies for you. It learns from the emails that you've gotten it's. Going to ask you a three prompt question here. You choose the prompt that you want, and then it can actually write a response. It can also reference a knowledge base. It can reference different documents, operating procedures. And, yeah, so it can provide contextual answers based on the documents that you provided.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then with these different shared emails, right? You can also get this team view which will show you across the team, all the open emails, who's working on those emails, right? I have eight open emails here. I can see matt has one, Kol has one. Rakesh has four. You can see them here. You could see the tags associated with them. So what types of emails they are. And then also, you can have these custom SLA set up which will let you know if an email is late… and you can click on them. You could see all the back and forwards very easily when the emails came in. Any changes to it. And then also, for the instance, if Rakesh shares out for the week, I could take all of his emails and just mass assign them to somebody else.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. So each team's going to have a folder for their emails, they can assign it to each other, see who's accountable and easily track which ones are late, which ones aren't et cetera.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Also have different integrates with different applications… right? Hubspot. So with the Hubspot, if there's if in Hubspot, if it's a, you… can bring through deal information, company information, contact information. So if somebody emails in and they're already an email in Hubspot, you could bring through all that information as well. And then we also got different ones, project management tools. Yeah.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  All right.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, I'll pause there. I mean, obviously, it sounds like you just transitioned to Hubspot here. So I wanted to just kind of give you the lay of the land there… questions, thoughts.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Yeah, no, I really appreciate this. You're right? We did just transition. So the chances that we're going to do it again probably pretty low. I won't lie. I'm not a big fan of Hubspot. It hasn't gone super well in a lot of ways. So maybe in the future, we could get transitioned to something else because service hub is not good. I guess my biggest question is how does this differ from Zendesk, Freshdesk? I mean, I've used a lot of different CRMS and it seems like it looks functional. It has a lot of the same functionality from what I'm seeing. So, what is it that makes hiver unique?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, what makes hiver unique is that hiver operates… predominantly on emails, right? So it's not like it's not a Zendesk. It's not this, it's not this hard to maneuver complex ticketing system, right? In an essence, what, hiver is an email management system that just treats emails as tickets, right? And then also, it's very scalable. So, essentially, you know, what a lot of companies come to us is they come to us for two reasons. Maybe they have a bunch of these shared addresses and they're just looking for better ways to manage it, right? And if you're if that's what your main thing is and, you know, you don't need, you don't need a complex Zendesk, right? You just need a better way to manage these support tickets, these accounting emails that you're getting et cetera. Also, we have 24 seven support. We offer white glove onboarding as well for anybody who signs up with 10, more, 10 or more users. You know, a lot of the other providers out there will only provide that kind of white glove experience for the bigger companies or the bigger orders that they get. So that's another thing too is the white glove experience. But yeah, I just say that it's easy to use powerful. And then it's really based on the emails.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Okay. That's good to know. So, is it only emails there's? No chat there's? No phone there's none of that. This is purely email management. Am I understanding that correctly?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So we actually have two products. We have an outlook product and we have a Gmail product. Our Gmail product is a bit more robust. It's our flagship product. It's the product that this company was started on. That one has… phone through air call. So you have to have air call. That one also has chat. Our outlook product is fairly new. It came out about a year ago, but it's constantly getting new stuff added to it. And it's still, I'd say about almost half the people companies that we sign up are signing up for our outlook product. It does have a chat feature as well. So there is a chat that you can put on your website and you can handle these chat directly here in hiver. And by the end of the year here, so fairly soon it's going to have AI agents for the chat as well which can reference your knowledge base and reference different documents and answer kind of those tier one support chats that are coming in. But other than those that can get assigned to someone here, but yeah, those would be, you know, emails, the biggest thing function that hybrid has. And then it also has a chat feature as well.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  That's good to know. So we have air call. I ask because we use chat phone and email pretty extensively here. We have just on my team, I mentioned there was eight people from your question, I thought could really benefit from it between our different support teams. We're talking closer to like 60 70 people that are on these different channels every day just constantly. So we would definitely want all three if we were to go with this. Does it have any reporting features, analytics that show, you know, time to close numbers coming in like all those different things?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely so. And then just question here with the air call. So using air call for your phone, right? And are using air call for their texting as well.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  I believe it's just phone right now?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So air calls phone. And then you said you have, oh, you have chat, yes on your website?

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  We didn't air calls fairly new to us as well because service hub doesn't have any native phone, which is silly. So we had to integrate air call with it so that's still fairly new and that we may expand to texting as well. That's just in the last couple of months. We've been in that as well.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yep exactly. Yeah. If you were to transition, I mean, hypothetically down the road, if you were to transition to hiver, we're looking for other phone partners as well, but yeah, we air calls our go to in Gmail. So I assume that's what we're going to have in our outlook product soon, and then it works.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Well, yeah. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. I think I have a slight delay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No. Does it, do you think, do you like using air call so far?

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  I don't use it day in and day out, but from what I've heard from the teams, it works fairly well. It does the job. It's not too complicated. I know they did like Zendesk and Freshdesk had just integrated phone support in it where we could just have the number and it worked natively through the platform and, that was a bonus because it wasn't a significant extra cost of having another third party system that we have to pay for, right? Right? But air call for what it is. And on the platform we're with right now, it does the job and works fairly well from, what I hear.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Great. Yeah, I've used air call and other companies, for not support but for sales and work fine for us. I guess I'm just curious here. What was kind of what kind of motivated the switch from, you know, Zendesk to Hubspot? And yeah.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Yeah, that's a great question. So essentially, I'll give you a little history of, Riverside is basically a conglomerate made up a bunch of companies. They have their one flagship product and their one company. And they bought a bunch of different education assessment platforms. And so they've merged all of these companies together into one. And as they did that everyone came with their own CRM, their own processes, their own systems. So, some of us were in Zendesk, others were in Freshdesk, and everyone used Hubspot as a CRM essentially for sales and success. So when we did that and we had to pay for all these different platforms and things were spread out. They decided earlier this year, it's not sustainable, which it's not. And they wanted to find a platform that everyone was on. They also wanted visibility for sales and success, to be able to see support tickets for their customers, things of that nature. And so, because sales and success predominantly used Hubspot, that's why Hubspot was chosen as the platform we were bringing everyone into because they have the support functionalities as well even though they're fairly new and honestly not very well built out so far hopefully in the future. But if not, I could see us transitioning again.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yep. That makes sense. Absolutely. Yeah, I think the company that I worked at actually before I joined here was… it wasn't because they owned a bunch of different companies or anything like that. But yeah, we were using Hubspot for it as well. So yeah, I definitely can see kind of the benefits of it and some things that aren't so great.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Yeah, Hubspot as a platform is great. It's just servicehub their support sections. Really. It's not good. They're building it out. Yeah, it's not ready yet.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So yeah, we have reporting here. You select the mailbox or mailboxes, you want to see, you select the timeframe that you want to see could be custom, could be last night and you'll see things such as like how many new conversations did you get last? How many new emails did you get? How many of those emails did you resolve? Is this up or down from the previous month? Also in this view, you can always group them by different categories, different custom fields. You can apply different filters as well and save these different views. So you can really slice and dice the data how you want. You also get the performance such as the average first response times resolution times. You're going to see it across the users as well. So like how much the workload across the team, how many emails each team member sent out, the performance of each team member, response times resolution times. You can also include things like customer satisfaction surveys, and then we have tag reporting which will let you see like, okay, in the past month, we got 14 emails about accounts payable in the past month, we got, you know, seven emails about invoices. And then when you click on these, you can also see the stats and performances of those, right? The response times, resolution times, et cetera. With the slas that you have set up, you can track things like how many violations did we make last month? You can group them and see the amount, you know, what types of emails did we have the violations on? Who were the people that violated the slas? Is it up or down from last month? You'll see like compliance, right? So how well you did with those slas, customer satisfaction surveys… you can build custom reports. You can export this to CSV file. You can apply all different types of filters. And then we also have dashboards as well. Perfect. Okay.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  That's good to know. And that is helpful. That, that is something we use quite a bit is the dashboards and reporting. So that is good to know. And that looks fairly similar. Yeah, honestly, a little cleaner in a lot of ways. I do like your guys' UI a lot. It seems very clean intuitive, user friendly.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's yeah. Again, like that's really the big reason I believe that we win deals against like Zendesk and those other players in the space is just because it's easy to get set up. We have onboarding as well. Only takes depending on the team size, could take a week, could take three weeks for the larger teams, but fairly simple to get them set up easy to make changes on the backend with different automations that we have and the different AI features that we're rolling out as well. So, yeah, fairly easy and simple probably than Zendesk and what you got going on with helpscout.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Yeah, it seems like a good platform. Like I said, I would be surprised if the company would be willing to switch right now. Yeah, we're literally still in the middle of the transition. Oh, my.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  God. Yeah.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  It's been fun.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  It's not going super well. Like I mentioned, I know they're going to want to give it some time, try to figure things out. But if it continues to not go well, probably through the rest of the school year, we may be having those conversations on. Do we need to switch again?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Well, obviously, I wish you the best hope it works out, but if not, you know, where to find us and we've done some pretty large transitions from Zendesk Hubspot as well. I mean, we have teams that have over a 1,000 plus users. So we are experienced when it comes to making those kinds of transitions. So, yeah, again, really appreciate the time, the transparency. We'll make sure that you were offered a gift card. Is that right?

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  I think so. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Yeah, we'll make sure you get that gift card. It's through a different company and… they factor what's going on with them, but we'll get it. It'll come from a gift card company called giftagram and it'll come in your email. If you don't get it for some reason in a week or something, just shoot me an email and I can follow up with giftagram just to make sure it comes through. Yeah, no problem. If you don't get it, just let me know. Don't be shy. And yeah, I really appreciate the time.

Kolter Atkinson (katkinson@riversideinsights.com):
  Yeah, man. Thanks for showing me. Like I said, if you can't tell, I really hate helpscout right now. So I would love to switch to something like this. And I'll definitely keep you guys in mind and we'll see how it goes. But I really appreciate the time and you showing me the platform?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Thanks. Kolter. Have a good one. You too bye.
