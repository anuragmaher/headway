Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Keith, how you doing?

Keith Stewart (keith.stewart@digital.ai):
  Doing well. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Doing well, doing well. Appreciate you finding the time today.

Keith Stewart (keith.stewart@digital.ai):
  Certainly, yeah. Happy to do it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, I'll set the agenda for the call here. Just want to spend the first couple minutes learning a little bit more about you, your business, maybe anything that was kind of top of mind that interested you in taking this meeting today? I don't expect you to know much about hiver. And then from there, I can tell you a little bit about our company, essentially hiver as a help desk platform and show you a bit of our product. Does that sound good?

Keith Stewart (keith.stewart@digital.ai):
  Yeah. Well, why don't we do it the other way around? Tell me a little bit about your company, because I remember, I saw something there that I thought was worth a discussion but not sure where to direct what I can talk about sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No problem. But essentially hiver is a modern easy… to use AI enabled help desk platform. So, essentially companies out there are using platforms like Zendesk, maybe intercom front. I'm not sure which ticketing system you're using if you're using one.

Keith Stewart (keith.stewart@digital.ai):
  Yeah, we use Zendesk.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Zendesk. Okay. Got it. We.

Keith Stewart (keith.stewart@digital.ai):
  Have a tool called maven, that we support. Do you guys compete with maven?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It doesn't come up too often. What does it do exactly?

Keith Stewart (keith.stewart@digital.ai):
  So, it basically does ticket summarization, and then has an AI that looks at our knowledge base and then suggests a response. And then we're about to expose that to customers where they can do ticket deflection, and it actually will… basically solve customer problems before they even hit our help desk team.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah. So, we would, we also do that? So, yeah, I guess. Yeah.

Keith Stewart (keith.stewart@digital.ai):
  So we would, we're I mean, we're about a year and a half into our journey with maven. You know, we've been debating whether or not we want to continue with maven or start using Zendesk's AI tool, but, you know, we're pretty well. I mean, we're definitely invested in Zendesk. So, I don't know if this is meant to replace Zendesk or not, but, you know, we have the add on of maven on top of that, and we're pretty invested there. I was kind of the impression that we were going more towards like the customer service, customer support type of like more along the lines of like a game site or something like that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, it's more of like a ticketing system for email and chat primarily. And then there's the AI elements also involved in it. So, yeah, we have customers that come over, you know, completely from Zendesk for, you know, it being hard to use, not using the AI systems that it provides. And then we also have some customers that end up using both. Maybe some teams use hiver and then some other teams can use Zendesk. So, yeah, that's more of what hiver is.

Keith Stewart (keith.stewart@digital.ai):
  Okay. Well, look, I think probably not to waste our time. This is probably a better conversation to kind of pause and, you know, we're pretty invested in Zendesk now, so I'll suggest give you some time back, okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Well. Appreciate, you know, you letting me know and taking the time here. I wish you the best.

Keith Stewart (keith.stewart@digital.ai):
  All right. Thanks a lot.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Thanks bye.
