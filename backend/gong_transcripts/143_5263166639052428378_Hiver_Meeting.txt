================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hi, Daniel. Thank you for joining. How are you doing today?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Good. And you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well, thank you. I hope you're feeling better sir?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yeah, yeah, much better.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Thank you again. Now, I'll keep it real quick for you. I discussed with my pricing team with regards to your budgets and I told them that, hey, we're looking at 10 people to manage, you know, eight to 10 different mailboxes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So all we're looking at are the customized pricing. So, you said you have got a budget of 180 to 200 dollars a month, not beyond it?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we'll go ahead and honor the same pricing for you. So we'll do it 20 dollars per login, which is 200 dollars a month. And within that, I'll give you the onboarding support. I'll offer you with this team set up and everything training with regards to it for 10 people and 10 mailboxes also.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yeah, but we are not 10 because we are six at the end.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Now, we do a bucket of either two and then five licenses, and then 10 licenses. So we are anyways, looking at say around, you know, 200 dollars, but you can start with six, add a couple of more users whenever it's needed. So we'll keep a record of 10?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Can we quickly send the offer so that I will check? And then we'll let you know?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. I can put that in writing. I mean, should I send you the order form like put everything in writing and send you a formal proposal letter? Yeah.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yeah, that would be nice. So I can confirm this operationally sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And what kickoff date you're looking at? So I can put that tentative date on the offer.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  and it's very difficult maybe in two weeks, something like this, two or three weeks, two weeks?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, this is just for our reference purposes, right? Because then if I'm actually locking the offer, I'm actually going to be putting a date on. It does not mean that we would not support you after that date, we would absolutely take care of the training and everything. It's just for our reference to start the billing or even then you know, if we happen to say we're looking at, let's say a tentative date of twentieth of November to get started. Does not mean that before that, I will not help you get started and set up. Of course, I will. So I'll just keep a date of twentieth of November on it.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. All right.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  And, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  me. Yeah, sorry?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Go ahead. Sorry, I,

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  will check the first offer, I mean, and then we let you know.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. But you're saying that you're comfortable within 180 to 200 range, right? No more than this a month. Yeah.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  But,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  sorry, you're breaking up, Danny, can you hear me okay?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Just one second. Just, we need probably not 10. We are good with six to seven because we have three also in the warehouse.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  But they all have nothing to do with the emails. They not need really, they just need the email address. One is enough for them. They not need to have access to, multi access. I made here a little bit, one second. I can maybe show you sure, one second… hiver.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Seconds now, I cannot see you, but it doesn't matter.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, actually, it was breaking up for my side, so I thought.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  I'd just, it was my side. It was my side breaks up. Okay? This can happen every 20 minutes. We'll.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  break, no worries. Okay. All right.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  A little bit stupid, but it is like it is, you can see the excel.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  So, I already prepared a little bit my, oh, really? We tried it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Okay. It's the minimum. And here, it might be the optimum, but this one here, it makes just no sense. I understood they are just working and not at the computer.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  One, two three four, five six seven. Yeah, these seven they are really make sense to introduce into the Hebrew language.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. No, that's very clear. Then we have, yeah, we can, we are still looking at 10 licenses by any chance, because like I said, we do the bucket volume. Yeah. So after five licenses, either we can do five, but this is not going to work for you because we need at least warehouse and Patrick also. So we would see, you know, a bucket of 10 and then let me calculate the number of mailboxes. So we have repairs, one, two three four five. It is the fourth.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  So, 15 is the maximum.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So these are 15 which essentially is going to be under the unlimited bucket for you? Okay. All right. Yeah, good. So you require maximum of 15, right? No more than that.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  At the moment, not, maybe, I mean not.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yet, or do I keep it 20 mailboxes for you then?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  If it's for the same price, of course, yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I will make an exception for you, which is why I'm saying, right? I'll put that 20 for you 20 mailboxes and 10 users.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And let me send you an offer on the proposal. And once you agree to it once you say, yes, we can always sign that off and I'll lock in the offer for you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And I'll put a date of twentieth just for the reference, so that we put that in writing and can we the offer? Okay? I may take another 10, 15 minutes to create it and I'll send that to you.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Tomorrow, I will be back in office. So I will everything check tomorrow morning, sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And we can connect again on Monday if you have any more questions on the offer. Yeah, if.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  possible, Tuesday or Wednesday?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Tuesday works fine. Let me see if we can connect at the same time, maybe slightly early a little earlier than 10 a M.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Also good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hiversync, I'll call it hiversync on.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Do you have some also movies where you show the, how it works? Everything? Oh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, absolutely. Let me also send you.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  All the links because I want to look over the weekend. Make some, we'll do that. How, what I wanna, how I want to have this communication even if it's nice. If you get us a proposal, how other big or middle companies is doing? So that we already can optimize our process at the beginning?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very much. Yes, sir. I will send you a guided tour and that will refer like a quick snippet of what it looks like, how your multiple team members who do not need to be part of all the mailboxes, pick and choices of, you know, people into multiple inboxes and how everything can be managed from one Gmail inbox, so that we don't log into different screens and we still take care of all the emails coming into these multiple inboxes. The idea is that there is no miss on emails. There is no delay on the response and people are aware of what they need to work on and you have a complete supervision of everything.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  And there's also possible to make internal tips, right? For everybody.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Internal notes, drop the comments, add, mention them, assign them the tasks. Yes, perfect. And.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  If a partner sent an email to a customer, I always see his answer, right? It's it's like really shared mailbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  When you say partner, is that your team? Our?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Office? Yeah, you know, one of our hiver members sent emails. I always see everything.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. You can. I mean, if that person is answering emails, a finance related email because you're going to be a part of finance inbox, you can always see the outgoing emails from your finance people. You can see the closed tickets wherever the already work is done, and they have closed it. So, you have complete visibility on all the new requests, all the ongoing requests and all the closed requests?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Perfect. Another question. If hiver can do this or not, can hiver also create, a… how, what's the name? I forgot the name one second. No. If you, if we have a customer, he wants to write us an email for a pickup, so that there is a list, a site where it's written, he wants to do this and what it is, so that we can make like a chart for him to fill out, which creates an email at the end.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, that will be more like a form a.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Form. Exactly. This is what I look a form. Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, you can do contact form and contact form can be pasted on the knowledge base, and that will be a source article, something like, let me show that to you. Can I share my screen sir?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yeah… sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Give me one minute. I'll share my screen.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  A lot of guys coming. Sure. Hello. Hi, nice.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  To meet you.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  It's like the idea. Now with hiver, it's also possible to create a form which we can make like for pickups. If a customer has a pickup, then they can fill out this, as a form formal, and he's going to show us now this solution quick.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, just give me one minute. I will log into my test account and show that to you. Is this a form pickup request going to be done by a specific team?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, if you notice my Gmail inbox here, I mean, I'm logged in into my test account. Yeah. So I would require all your agents to simply log in into their individual Gmail accounts. Okay? And from there, you notice these are multiple inboxes that I am a part of. So for you, it will be finance orders, exceptions like whatever inboxes you showed me in the chart, right? So all of those would be right there. Now, if I am a part of these inboxes, I have all the requests for customer requests, here, finance requests here. And because you will be the manager Daniel, you will also see the new requests in the unassigned. So you would see the request who needs to work on it. So you assign the conversation, let's say, if I assign it to myself, it becomes part of mine and all the requests which are done by the team. You would see into the closed bucket. You would see which agents has worked on it. What is this? Regarding? It? Was billing? It was invoice, this was payment, all of these other tags. Also, all of this can be by the way automated for you. Now, with request to the pickup form, two ways to look at it. One, you could actually put a chatbot like this on your website for the pickup request. So instead of say chat with us, you can always say request a pickup. And when your users, your customers can actually go to your website or contact page, they will click in here. They would start the conversation. And here, instead of message, you can always type in the information you want to ask, okay, what is the name? Where do you want the pickup from? What is the item or parcel? How big is that? Whatever information that you require, right? And we'll create.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  a message to us.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, it will send you the message inside your chat box here. So, instead of sales chat, you would call it pickup chat and the same agents who are managing your different inboxes. The seven eight people you showed me, all of them can be a part of the pickup chat inbox here so that you would receive new unassigned chat requests here with requests to the exact form that they fill. And this can be even created as a ticket. You can even send a response also. And on top of it, if you don't require a chat pickup bot here, what you can do is maybe add a form like something like help hiver. So you'll have help lsgolf, a support help document where you could say, what are the pickup guides? Whatever you know, information that you require, without submitting a ticket, I can find out what is the bare minimum requirement I need for a pickup? And if I don't find an answer, I can go ahead and fill this form. I can show you how the form would look like for you.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  One second, help hiver at lsgolf. If you go there, you can also say a case delivery, and you can say, hey, you can go to this website, help at lsgolf. And you can enter the date. You can ask exactly what you need and you can solve it, right? Yes, yes, good. Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then from the help document, you could set up a form which would ask them the name, subject, email, any information that you require, and the customer will be able to fill a form from the help document itself. If I show you my test account, and I take you to the admin panel.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Just from my understanding, the help at lsgolf, this is based on hiver page or it's it will be on our page.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It will be on your page. We will give you the framework, but it will be your documents.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Just like you have any help center, you have all the frequent asked questions. We'll help you set up, it, set it up, but it will be all managed by you in the admin panel and knowledge base. And from here itself, you can go ahead, set up a knowledge base. Let me maybe give you a quick background at the backend. So it'll be Gmail. And then you put in the email address and, okay, and enable the contact forms. You'll be able to see what do you want to contact us for contact form? You enable that you customize the form and the form customization can be submit an issue. Or here, I could write submit a pickup request. What do you need a heading for? And the message? And this will actually generate a ticket for you in the mailbox for pickup. If you don't want agents to be available live on the chat?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  I can completely customize all questions.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. Yes, customize the question. You can even currently, today, if you use Google Forms, we can even support that.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  And this is all included, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, it is of, no, yeah, this is no extra cost. I'll even set you up on this. I mean, I will have, you know, a customer onboarding manager, help you set up your form also.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Good. And when you want, but do we have to put this on our website or can we also base this on hiver? This page?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I would say because your customers are going to be submitting requests instead, you would put it on your website or you could generate a page like help lsgolf. Com, and that page can be put on your website. It's a zero coding by the way. Otherwise you will get a request like a URL. Also something like let me show that to you. And you can always put that URL in the email, wherever you are sending a pickup request, email. You can say, refer to this URL to submit a form request.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yep.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, you will get a URL, like this hiver demo instance hiver. So this is how you would get to see a quick request.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Good. Is that good for me? Yes, you can say that, then you've seen that this is possible. We could specifically ask exactly the question we need. Have you seen the wrong delivery? Tell me which delivery? What was missing? How much was missing, and not the E mails where you only get the whole thing that's the basic idea. If you have a ticket, then you can work off the ticket that's right? And it's also easy for Maria or something.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Bye bye.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you so much. All right, Daniel. So yeah, your request can be done in multiple ways, whichever is the most easiest. We'll recommend that one. Either we put a request button like a chat button on your website just like this request, a pickup, or we can help you with.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  That is not possible because somebody needs to always be there, right to answer even.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  If nobody's there, the requests are still going to be here for offline, and people can come here, pick up the offline requests because these will be assigned to bot.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And bot can ask, you know, bot can ask multiple questions, whatever the pickup is all about. And then whenever team logs in, they can start picking up the request, working on those requests.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Introduce everything. And then we can talk maybe about the.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Pickup request. Yeah, it is fairly simple to set it up. Don't worry about that. Daniel. I've helped a lot of companies do that already. So I can see this is doable easily.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  And how is, what's about the safety of emails? I mean, after access to our emails?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Not at all, sir. Now that's the best and a beautiful portion. If I were to take you to the hiver security and privacy, all the emails are still on your Gmail servers, by the way, because we are sitting right on top of your Gmail to help you manage your emails better. But if you notice the privacy information, we don't actually use any of those data like we don't look at your emails. These still go to your email servers. Hiver has got nothing to do with your customer data at all?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Even on top of it, we are a GDPR compliant. We are totally hipaa compliant. We are soc two compliance. Also, I can go ahead and share all the security policies if you need it.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yeah. All good. And you are based in Indian? We?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Have got headquarters in San Jose in the U. S. U.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  S. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes. And we have got a remote team which is global for 24 to seven. I am located in India because I did not want to move out of my home country, but we have got support folks all across the globe. We do 24 seven support. My chief sales officer sits in the bay area. The CEO and the CTO are in the U. S itself. So we've got global presence at the point in time, Daniel.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  That's good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And one of our customer success managers sit in Norway. So we have got team in Europe also.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  And what's hiver is doing for the next process? Do you still have some plan to develop your program with?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very much, if I would show you the actual roadmap, you will be amazed to see that every week we come up with at least four to five new features. Now, the next gen, but what we are looking at is more to do with the AI, where hiver is able to understand the email reply to your customers automatically without needing an agent on the place. Hiver is understanding your emails, helping you categorize the sentiments as to whether this is a customer which is irate, customer, happy customer. Hiver is able to, you know, look at all of those, you know, requests with regards to the knowledge base, like this customer is asking for a pickup request. Can I generate a pickup label and send a quick response? So these are the boards, right? I mean, you have a complete roadmap here. We are looking at a customer module. We are looking at email template suggestions, like if you are receiving repetitive nature of emails, hiver is looking at AI power template suggestion, hey, looks like a refund request, use this template, save your time. Send this to the customer.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  And also spam and everything they can say. This is spam. And then he will always delete.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Automatic updation of email tags that these are the spams, hiver closes those emails automatically for you and we can even set up the rules, the same Gmail spam functionality and filter can still work for you.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  And also phishing mails.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yep. Good.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  That's important because we get too many mails. I just want to reduce everything to a minimum.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Let me show you how I have been helping a lot of my customers. Let's say any email that is coming to your support inbox, and those emails look fishy. Those are maybe spam emails or just the notifications where my team doesn't need to work on. All I would do is create an automation rule and say, whenever these emails come in, if the condition is anything to do with a very specific domain because this domain always contacts us like noreply. Com, or discount. Com. Or the condition could be, if the subject of the email contains anything to do with fishy or whatever. Yeah. And then if the body also contains email body contains xyz which is fishy emails and all of that, I can go ahead and then match, add a step action, simply close the email, update the status to closed. We don't want to work on these emails. It will save a lot of time for your agents to not look into these emails. You will bypass the email, and you can just simply add a tag to these emails that these are no action needed emails. So I can even add I,

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  can put a tag. Yeah, that's good. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  that you can look at those emails still at later time whenever you have some minutes.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Sometimes your customer email will go into it because he used the wrong name or something like that, correct?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. But most of the times it would work because these are still the fishy emails and we will go through the fashion in which you've been receiving these emails to suggest the most relevant workflow for this automation. So, yeah, that's possible.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. I'll go ahead, prepare the offer, send that to you. I'll put a formal date of the twentieth of November on to it and we will go ahead and reconnect again on Tuesday. I was sending you an invite. If you could just give me one minute, I will send that invite to you slightly earlier than today timing so that we could review your offer. And if, in case you come across any more questions, we'll also go ahead and address that for you. So there is an invite for you on Tuesday. I've sent that.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Good. Well, that's good at the moment. It's fine.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Any other question that I can be of help to you today?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Not yet, but I will check. When you send me some tutorials or movies. I will check everything and make a plan. What could be good? And what not?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. All right, Daniel, thank you so much for your time again.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  But for me, still, everything is just in English. You still not have the option for switch to German.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I will tell you how my German customers, my Dutch customers are using hiver, they would always have an option to translate the interface. So you can have your basic Gmail interface into your language. All the email templates can be in Dutch, German or Swiss. The tags can be in Dutch, German and Swiss. Even the replies that you're doing are going to be through the local keyboard, right? So that can be done. It's just that the administrator interface that you and I will set up would be in English. Otherwise, for agents tags, email templates, keyboards, everything will be in your native language. So we don't find any challenges as such.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Good. Yeah, sounds good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right, Daniel. Thank you so much. Did you receive the invite for Tuesday?

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Yep. Sounds good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. I look forward again to talking to you. Bye bye.

Daniel Breitenmoser (daniel.breitenmoser@lsgolf.ch):
  Bye bye.
