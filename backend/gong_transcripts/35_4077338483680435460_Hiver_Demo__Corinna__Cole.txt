Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, carina.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Hey, how's it going?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you doing?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Pretty good. Managed to catch this flu that everyone seems to have. So trying to imagine. I'm not as sick as I know I am, but otherwise, good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Yeah, thanks.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But where are you based out of?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  I'm New York? Oh.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Very cool. Me too. I'm in park slope Brooklyn.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Oh, nice. I'm in williamsburg.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, very cool. But I appreciate you hopping on the call here today. So just to jump into it and set a quick agenda, would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role? What got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Sure. Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I can introduce myself first. So my name's Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I've been in the customer service space for a little over seven years now and yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can help you today. Okay? Great.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  I'm carina, I'm a senior accountant at a consulting firm. And so our job is working as financial consultants in the talent management space. So a lot of influencer marketing, a lot of our clients are both the influencers and the agencies. And there's just a lot of email communication between them and us and the brand. We predominantly use Gmail as our main form of communication with all of our clients. So they do a lot of requesting things to us directly that we have to then send out mostly through quickbooks, but some other platforms as well. And I was looking at hiver as a possible solution just because I spend a significant portion of my day managing my inbox, but now we've recently hired on a couple of new team members as well. And ideally they won't have to spend if they log on for an hour, they can do an hour of work and not spend the whole hour just going through their inbox. So really we're trying to use it as a way to like manage employees better.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Gotcha. So, are you looking for it to manage like their personal inboxes better? Or is there like a shared inbox that you have as an organization that you're managing?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Ideally, we have a shared one we recently created that's not in use yet, but ideally, it would be going to their personal inbox. That way I can just, you, know who's doing what, and they know who's doing what, without having to go back and forth on email communicating that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So you would want like in the ideal world, would you want everyone's like personal email communications to funnel to that shared mailbox so you can see everything they're receiving?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Yeah. I guess what I'm imagining is that we can tell our clients like just email the accounting at email for us and then we'll make sure it's handled appropriately. And then from there, on our end, we could manage whose inbox it goes into. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Gotcha. Okay. So ideal world, you want to change to a model like from going forward, you're going to have like people reaching out to that shared mailbox and you want to distribute it out from there?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. That makes sense. And how many people would be on the team who are kind of managing these email requests?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Right now, we have five, I would say it's possible. It'll grow to like seven this year, but I would say under 10 for sure.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So like five to 10 users depending. Okay, awesome. But I can hop into, you know, a demonstration here, carina, to show you how, you know, we're helping teams better manage those shared inboxes as an organization. Accounting is a very, you know, familiar use case for us. We work with a lot of Ar teams, ap teams, invoicing teams, whatever it might be. But just to confirm you are using Gmail today, right? Yes. Okay. Awesome. So taking a look at my screen here, carina, what's nice about hiver and a key differentiator off the bat is that we live within the Google workspace. So we're going to help you better manage that shared inbox that you created and do things like help, you know, help with delegation ownership, tracking the status of the conversations as well as organizing those conversations and much more. But taking a look at the top right here, right? You're just going to log in with your normal Gmail. And then on the left hand side, we're going to have our personal inbox up top. And then below are these shared inboxes that we're managing as an organization. So in this case, here's, the customer success mailbox, the finance teams, the healthcare operations support. Let's take a look at the customer support share mailbox for this example. So when I click into it, it's going to open some sub views beneath it that's going to help us manage the intake of communications. So the first is the unassigned, you know, new emails that need to be distributed. The next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me from this mailbox, and then the team view. So here, carina, as the conversations are coming in and you're delegating them out here's where you can see what all five people are working on in real time, what's outstanding and what needs to be completed? Okay? We want to pause here. Any questions so far?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  No, nothing so far. Something I'll just mention about our current workflow is it's a lot of like I have to like loop in the correct person. And then I just snooze the email to a couple of days down the line and check if they've actually completed it. So I think this would hopefully solve our problem of that because it would still be under their thing and I'd be able to quickly and easily see that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's correct, exactly. And I'll show you how we'll track that. So going into the unassigned right, we have seven new emails in the unassigned check section. You can do a bulk assignment where it's like, hey, let's assign all these conversations, let's say to Alex, but, or maybe like add a tag in bulk, change the status in bulk, whatever it might be. But in this case, I'll just click into one of these conversations for this example. And when I click into this email thread, it's gonna open up a tab on the right hand side that helps us manage the intake of communications. So assigning it, in this case, I'll assign to myself letting the team know I'm gonna follow up and own this conversation. The next way we can assign work is like a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the emails as they come in. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So identifying keywords in the subject line, maybe keywords or phrases in the body of text, and then routing to the specific person who should own that conversation. And then we have that ability to measure that sentiment analysis, understanding how the client is feeling in that conversation, track the status, whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks. And then those tags for organizational purposes, ways to put conversations in buckets, folders, or queues, however you like to call them. And then also having that ability on the backend to understand why have people reached out to this mailbox? What are the common request types we're seeing? Okay… what are your thoughts on the like, how ideally like will you be assigning work? Will it be more of like a manual? Would you wanna create some automations? Or could you do like a round Robin that'll equally distribute it?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  I think there's a couple things I think like initially I'll definitely have to do it manually as we're onboarding these new team members and figuring out their exact roles. I guess ideally down the line, I would know that like any email from this specific agency would maybe be assigned to this specific person would be like an ideal function.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. No, that makes sense. That makes sense. That's something. We can definitely work with you as you continue to leverage the platform and scope it out. And then we also have like custom fields for tracking maybe the email priority type. We can also create fields like, you know, follow up dates. In this case, this is just showing like different dropdown fields, but we can create follow up dates where let's say a conversation reaches that certain date that you need to follow up this client on. It can then send you like a notification being like, you know, follow up date is reached, please reach back out to the client.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that's great. Where do the reminders show up? So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You'll get a notification up here, see like the 32 notifications, So you'll get notified up here being like need to follow up. Okay? And then the last thing on the right hand panel, right? Is that ability to collaborate so you can loop people in, have conversations on the right hand side of the email and they'll live here throughout the, you know, entire, you know, history of it. So if you ever have to go back and reference the notes, you'll always have it to go back to and then that will send a notification to matt. He'll receive it up here. He can click on it, take him right to this thread where we can keep having that back and forth. Maybe we need more information to reply. We also do have an AI co pilot that can draft responses based on the data that you feed it. So just helping your team, you know, leverage AI by searching through your internal documentation and then sending out those messages accordingly.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Okay. And.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then we can insert that into the draft. And then once we deem this is done, you know, we're just going to send and close that conversation, changing the status from open to closed. And then we're moving on, you know, to the next communication.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, I'm going to pause here though. What are your thoughts on this so far?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Yeah, I think that sounds good. So far. I'm curious just like about my, so my current like inbox management technique is literally just to keep everything unread until I've handled it, which… isn't the most ideal cause. Then if I accidentally click on something, then it's like it's missed altogether.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  in terms of like then like sending things out like this and having these different inboxes, like where does it actually like live? Is it like only in that folder that these emails are coming in? Does it come into my regular inbox as well or in like when I'm assigning it to people? Do they have to click into things to like see these?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Assignments, see the assign to me section right here. Yeah, this is where people can pay attention. Like, hey, like what's in my queue? What do I need to take care of? I have 36 conversations that have been assigned to me. And then instead of like having the unread red type stat, like instead of like doing that to understand, hey, what have we kind of looked at? You can use open pending closed to track the statuses of those emails.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Okay. That makes sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then you, we have these different views, right? So if I go to all views, you can create customized views based on request type. So we have some standard ones which are like unassigned mine team. We have the overdue pending closed views, and then you can create custom ones, right? We have billing requests, billing and referral, bugs, cancellations, escalations, you can create all these different customized views by drilling into these filters on the right hand side.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then is there anything from like an analytical perspective, Karina, that you'd be looking to glean in a little further from the team?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  I guess the only thing that we in like a lot of our analytics we just deal with in quickbooks, but yeah, in Gmail, like one of our promises is to like respond to all requests within 24 hours, 24 business hours. So ideally, we'd have like a easier way to measure that than just like catching it every time we're late and tallying it down.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. We definitely have some solutions for that. So let's say we want to take a look at the last 90 days of data or take a look at that support mailbox, just to show you some workload metrics. We can see like the workload like active new resolve conversations over the time period, what our average first response time was as a team, our average resolution time… so that'll kind of gauge like, hey, like how as a whole, are we responding within 24 hours, right? Or are we resolving it within those 24 hours, whatever we're trying to like glean? And then we can see per user metrics. So emails assigned, per user email sent out per user, understanding the workload distribution, and then their individual performance metrics.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How long is it taking each individual to respond to emails when they get assigned to them? And how long is it taking them to work it end to the closed status?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the tag, so understanding why are people reaching out? What are the hot topics we're seeing request types that are coming into that mailbox? And how long is each request type taking our team to work through?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Okay. In terms of tags, I don't know if this would make sense, but I'm just, I guess thinking through it. So how I do my inbox right now tags is I'll have like by client and then by task. So I'd have like a invoice request and payments received, and payment sent and bills do like all these different categories within a certain client. Like would there be, would that make sense like with this system? Or would there be a better way to do that? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you can create a tag for that specific client, right? So if you want to organize based on the client, you can just go to tags, go create tag and let's say I want to call it like walmart or whatever, right? So then from there, we've now created that walmart tag and then we can create views around that. So if you want to organize it further and be like, hey, I want to see all conversations that pertain to, you know, walmart that also have, you know, billing associated with it?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Okay. Got it. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You, you can multi layer tags to understand, you know, what's going on with each customer request type, whatever it might be.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Okay. And then.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You mentioned also, we do have slas as well. So if you want to understand, you know, how the team is performing within a certain timeframe, we can definitely understand whether you're in compliance or violating those SLA goals. So let's say we want to take a look at the support mailbox. We'll go down to, you know, slas… and here's where we can create those policies to understand if we're meeting those metrics that you mentioned before. I think it was like what was it responding within 24 hours is the goal?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Yeah. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We could have like, you know, all conversations that come in. We have a first response goal of let's say, you know, 24 hours and we want to resolve it within like 72 hours. If we're not hitting these metrics, you can choose who to notify to escalate the conversation. And then you can also have a do soon where it's like maybe we want to have a bump reminder halfway through where, you know, 12 hours and 36 hours or something like that. So just another safety net to ensure that things don't slip between the cracks and if they do the right people are being notified about it.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  OK, great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the last thing I wanted to touch on was the automations. We can create some really helpful automations for streamlining things like responses or assignments. So this is one where it's like new conversation is received, you know, hits the mailbox, but we can have different triggering events… and we've identified within the conditions that the body and the subject line contain these keywords, urgent, business critical and stop working. We're then going to add the tag urgent issue, assign it to Raghav, and then maybe send, you… know, a customized reply being like, you know, we're sorry to hear about this issue. Like we'll get back to you X y Z. So just a great way to streamline our automations to automate tagging, assigning, sending customized replies. We also have one where it's like our AI sentiment analysis is updated and it's updated to negative and very negative. We're then going to send a proactive email saying, hey, sorry to hear about this poor experience. You know, here's. More information, blah, blah, blah, we'll get back to you in xyz and then we're going to assign it to Jeevan, and then escalate it to the L3 team. So just ways you can kind of streamline, you know, using these automations.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Okay, interesting.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we have a general autoresponder, not sure if you're leveraging anything like that today, just being like, you know, when people reach out to that mailbox, just sending an automated response right away, being like we'll get back to you shortly.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But those are pretty much the main things I wanted to cover today. We also do offer a free trial and that's what I typically recommend for next step. Is that something you would be interested in doing?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Yeah, we tried it before the holiday, but things were just so chaotic. So I didn't even get to really play around with it. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And I can extend that as well. Let me see. Do you know under what email that was created?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Probably under either Kristen at the lgcg. Com or accounting at the lgcg. Com.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, I see Kristen right here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I can actually extend this to give you another.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  seven days to test or I mean, nine days actually. So I just extended your trial to the fourteenth. Were you able to, do you still have access to that? If you refresh your screen? Do you see hiver pop back up check?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  As of now, it's still saying that the account is suspended on the little icon in the corner.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Can you share your screen for a second?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Oh, wait there we go there it is.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, it's working now. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. So, yeah, your whole team, you know, you, Kristen, Gianna, you all should have access to it now and I've just extended the trial out till the fourteenth.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Okay, great. Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Would you have some time to reconnect, let's say, end of this week to see how the trial is going to see if you can answer any questions. Let's say like same time on Friday?

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Yeah, I should be able to, then. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And this same time works for you on Friday? Yeah. Okay. Awesome. So I will send over that invite. And then I'll also send over an onboarding guide that you can, you know, continue to leverage as you get up and running with hiver.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Okay, great. Thank you. But.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It was great to meet you, Karina. I'll follow up after this and I hope you have a great week.

Corinna Jones (corinna@thelgcg.com):
  Thanks, you too. All.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Take care, bye.
