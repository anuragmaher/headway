================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Nick. How are you doing today?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Nick, how are you? Hey, I'm.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  good. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm good. Nick. Looks like it's been a while since we last connected. Yeah, like it's been a year. How's it been going on hiver with you?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  It's been going really well. I feel like maybe we are using it in a very limited way. You know, maybe there's more that we could do with it. So that's one of the reasons I was hopping on here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Definitely, I'm happy to help you unpack how you can use more and more of hiver while ensuring that you have all the right feature sets available to you as well, Nick, you know, considering it's been a decent bit since we connected, I had a cursory overglance at like the way you've got hiver set up and it looks like you've got finance wires. Payload support. Seems to be the chunkier one. If you don't mind, could you like just refresh my memory on like how the support inbox is functioning? What are the gaps or challenges you see that you'd like to explore? If hiver can fix?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Well, so the way that the inbox is working great as a ticketing system, it's really made our support more efficient. So, we're kind of using that shared inbox mainly the support inbox for just generic questions that come in from our agents. The other inboxes are specifically for departments finance. And most of those are getting notification emails from payload notifying us that we've gotten a payment in same thing with the wire finance et cetera. So that's been really great. I have also been using setting up shared email templates that's been helpful. I've only got a few so far but even things like people requesting a W9, right? I can just anybody in the company who's on the support can send the email templated email out. So that's been great. And I've started playing with the knowledge base. I would love to be able to put our sops… and different things into the knowledge base and create portals for the agents to be able to self serve. But that's kind of a it's kind of a big lift. And I'm trying to figure out the best way to do that. And then of course, the email came through with the AI portion where maybe you could ask fuzzy questions and get answers from it. So that's where we are. So I feel like where we, us using it as support agents has been going really well. And the next step would be creating something for some self service.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. No, that makes total sense. So, Nick, if you can share your screen and maybe show me what the current setup looks like. I think I'll be able to like recommend best practices if that helps, and also take a peek to see if there's anything else you could be?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure what exactly you want. Wait, I'm sharing the wrong screen. Sorry hold on.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Stop share.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Why is it? I don't want to share this screen. I want to share that screen. There we go.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay. Can you see my inbox?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, I can, yep.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay, great. I don't know why it looks funny. So, what did you want to see as far as my setup is concerned?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Let's see. So the first thing I wanted to check was the, you know, you'd mentioned that, the ask AI piece is not necessarily, you know, kind of working how you'd like for it to. So can you take me to your hiver admin panel and… then you.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  also be, the, I was going to add this, the AI thing that's supposed to recognize thank yous and does not work.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that's it's actually a good feedback, context and a little bit of background on that is we're actually reworking the entire foundational model for the thank you detector. So, the one that's currently active is about three fourths of the way there. In terms of being completely revamped, we're working towards having that fully set in stone and transition to the new AI model that we're building as well. And so, I think in like a couple of weeks is what the internal timeline looks like. It should be more accurate, more spot on and get the job done for you. Okay. Yeah, but thanks for letting me know. So, yeah. So with that said for now, can you click on AI co pilot on the bottom… and where do you have it enabled? Like which inbox do you currently run it for? Yeah, support? Can you click on knowledge sources right? Under ask AI? Yeah. All right. So, no documents, no attachments. You've got to connect it to your knowledge base on hiver. All right. Can you head over to your knowledge base real quick on the left side?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Yeah. And so this is like, yeah, we're still building this out for sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. All right. So, Nick, what I'd want to do is basically test, any bit of information within this knowledge base on an email chain within the ask AI. I just wanted to make sure the whole connection is set up in the right way. So can you just click on Gmail on the top left? Yep. And, you know, just go to support inbox, any email, if you can pop one of those open from there?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Pending close doesn't make a difference. Yeah. Okay. Let's open one of these. Oops. All right. Let's get the co pilot running? Oh, can you click on the hiver logo on the top, right one that pulls out the right panel? Yeah, perfect. And then ask AI at the bottom. So, what I'd like for you to do now is, you know, maybe just ask it a question where, you know, the information is on the knowledge base that you have, just like type out a question?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, the reason I'm running this test is because even with ask AI about two and a half weeks back, we did, a major sort of revamp of the model where we've made it more accurate. We've made it more precise and it should give you information that's more detailed when it comes to questions before you type out a response, could you, and?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  I may not have this actual answer in the.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sources, yes. But.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  It is pulling.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly. If you click on the two sources, there you go, just got it both from the KB and an added advantage we've done here is within the KB in itself. If you've got a webpage, an open link or an additional KB or something, then you can actually add it as a hyperlink within the KB article itself. And that would also be used when hiver's AI is fetching results on the co pilot.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay. And then can I ask you another question about this? Yes, please. So we had talked about this before and I don't know if we were ever able to if you guys had ever made any progress on it, but we were not able to read.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Clickup articles. Is that still true?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Clickup articles. Yes. So as it stands right now, we don't have a clickup integration for the co pilot as a whole. What we have on the roadmap is we've got notion coming up in a week and we've got confluence as the other highly requested platform that from our customers that will be having an integration with co pilot directly. As of right now. If you've got clickup, the best suggestion I have is copy pasted on a hiver article, best way possible, right? That's what?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  I've been doing what becomes cumbersome with hiver right now. And maybe you have a solution for this that I don't know about. But what's cumbersome for hiver when it comes to the knowledge base is that it kind of has a versioning history and I get that what it doesn't have. And I just have to build this out. But what it doesn't have is article ownership and a review cadence. I almost have to create hyperlinks into. I have to put all the articles into hiver. This is what my workaround is. So tell me if this is the best way.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay, put.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  All of the articles into hiver and then link those from the knowledge base back to clickup and create a review cadence and who owns them because there's no way to do that in the actual knowledge base.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Interesting. So, what you'd want to do is basically have an approver effectively like a review approver and a back or like a flow, which no, I see what you mean. I see what you mean. I see where you're coming from.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  And it has to, like in the past, when I've worked with knowledge bases, you might have three four 510. I mean, in some cases, 100 people contributing to a knowledge base. So the owner of that article is attached to it, and then you can set a review cadence, right? So you could say every three months, the owner of this needs to approve this article again. Yeah, just so that the information stays current.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that's pretty valid. That's pretty valid. And you're right? I don't think that's something we've kind of explored or gotten started on at this point. And, you know, the reason I'm assuming and still going to check with my team to see what that looks like. But the reason is also because we're going to be launching hiver as a web application over the next three to six months. Okay? So we are also going to be having a lot of these in terms of versioning, a more detailed version of hiver, more detailed and deeper features as well built out on what we're calling hiver, Omni, which is the hiver web platform, which will then sort of trickle down to Gmail. So I'm assuming that might be the reason why nobody might have picked this up or gotten back to you in terms of what that looks like. But with that said, you know, let me go ahead, have this added as a feature request for the team and see if there's anything immediate additional workarounds that it doesn't require you to go through like clickup and track review cycles there.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Yeah, there's a fewer platforms that I have to sort of because I'm going to have to, you know, update multiple places and I'm trying to eliminate that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Not completely hear where you're coming from. You know, I used to build knowledge bases and write things so I could get where you're coming from. You know, in terms of reviews, a periodic check reminder to be like, hey, just make sure everything is fine, you know, and have like one owner who has the final say on every article, input from different contributors, right? I understand your thought process. Let me check with the team to see if there's any immediate headway, any other alternative suggestions or if that's something that's just going to be picked up in due time.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So, I've made a note of that coming back to the AI piece of it, I know you've started testing out the copilot from what I'm seeing it's able to get you the right source of information, other details as well. Any other aspects of AI that you think are useful for your team as it stands.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Well, like I said, I think that at some point a self service bot would be helpful for our agents to be able to. So right now, we use workvivo as our intranet and I don't love it at all. And their knowledge base is awful. So it's really not a practical place for us to, it's great for communication like they, but it's not great for like I said, for the knowledge base portion of it. So, you know, being able to have… an API bot or something that we can like place… on there or place another, you know, place somewhere that agents could access it even if it was in their own Gmail?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And what would you expect this bot to do?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  I expect it to be able to crawl the knowledge base so that they could ask a question that's like.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You know, like, all right. So, is this a good summary? Are you effectively looking for a more conversational version of ask the AI that's not just tied to a response every single time?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Yes, not for the support agents, but for our real estate agents, which would be our customer base, right? So those are our customers as far as they're concerned.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. I hear where you're coming from. So on that front, thanks for the details. So, on that front, what we are already working on is having hybrid chat be more AI enabled. So effectively, you know, something like having a chat widget on your website, right? Pops up as a tenant or a prospective client of yours. They'll go in and before they initiate a chat with your team, they can pretty much and this is half of this exists as of today, right? Like a part of this is already available where you can tie in your knowledge bases or knowledge base articles to the chat widget and effectively help your, have your prospective clients check out the knowledge base articles alongside your, I'm, sorry, have the knowledge base articles surface alongside having the conversation or the ability to chat with an agent?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. And what I'm assuming is you want for it to be a little more AI enabled or AI enabled as a whole, where if they type out a question, the first thing they see is a knowledge base article or a KB that has that data before they start an agent chat.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let me quickly share what we have today and you can tell me if I'm getting warmer to what you're looking for something like this.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Can you see my screen? Is this closer to what you're looking for? I don't.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  it's not sharing yet. I don't see your screen.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, oops. My bad. I thought it had started interesting. Okay, let me know if you can see my screen or when you can.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  See my screen now, I can, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Perfect. Is this similar to what you're looking for, you know, chat widget of sorts, where when they click on, initiate a chat before, you know, it used to be send a message. Now, what you can do is feed it your knowledge base articles. And that way send a message becomes a smaller title and they can actually search within your knowledge base articles first and then go to send a message if they don't find what they need.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Yes, that is right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. I mean, if that's the case, you can't have this enabled as of today. Like this is available right away.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  And where does that live though? Where does that chat function live?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that's going to be within your home. It's going to be chat. You'll have to add it to like your web page using like a HTML copy paste on source code. Now, you can decide which web page it lives on and what you need to do is just put this on your website's, body type. So as soon as you do that, it's going to be like a small little bubble. You've got all the customizations, right? Like color logos, a whole lot. And effectively, you can, you know, to an extent even configure some notches to that, you know, write the title URL, and then define which parts of the URL gets going. Okay?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  I can, then I can start, I can start looking at that so that's under. So I'm going to admin panel, go to home. I'll go home. Okay?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Go to home. Go to chat.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Go to chat. Okay?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. And then you have to like type out the basic details to create the inbox… what you can share your screen and I can track along.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hold on one second.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay. There we go. Okay. So I'm here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So this would be the first step for now. Let's just give it a name. We can change all of this later.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Let's go with the next. Let's just keep it for you for now because we can add them later as well.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Again, all of this can be customized later, but let's just like continue for the time being. And then, yeah, I mean, like again, just give it a name which you can modify later if you want to give a lot to name and an avatar.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay. Whatever. I'll just save my name for now. No, I won't. I'll call him Lewis.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Cool. Just select one from the avatar list. All of this can be modified and it's not going to go live if we do this right now. Yeah. Okay. Create inbox, and that's your basic. Okay. Right? So once it's up and running. Perfect. Now, click on shared inboxes on the left side and you're going to see that chat pop up here. There. We go. So now click on chat with us. And that's all the settings that I was showing you help articles in chat, was that specific space of the KB? Okay. Yeah, you can go there and then external, so, enable.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Articles in your JavaScript please have an external knowledge base first. So, if I go to my knowledge base right now, internal, but I can't set up a separate one, it has to be one or the other, right? Yeah, at.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  this point, it has to be only one and that's something that we've already got feedback about that again. Sorry, I just don't have a top of mind in terms of what that development cycle looks like.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay. Yeah, no, no, and I think it's okay. I just, it makes a difference, you know, it makes a difference in what we put in there because as an internal knowledge base, you know, we can put things in that are fairly private, but as soon as we make it external that anyone can access, we have to be more judicious in what we're adding. So, yeah, but that's fine. That's not. I mean, it would be great if we could do both one of each, but, so yeah, I could, I second that feedback. But for now I can, you know, whatever.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So what I'd suggest for maybe the time being, just explore the options of the chat. And whenever you're ready to make it live copy, paste, the body tag, that code that you'll see within the chat inbox, look at gender, yeah, general settings at the bottom.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Yeah. Okay. And so if I copy this, then I just put it into the code on the website.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's about it anywhere between the websites body tag and you'll have like that little widget with the avatar with the color with everything showing up, you can have it like bubble up and down with like nudges. And so that way whenever somebody is on a certain webpage or across the website as a whole, they can go in, they'll get the bubble. They can click through, type out, check the faqs. And if they still want help chat with your team, and you can do like a lot of configurations, you can have the bot run through a couple of questions, get the relevant details you need. So your team members can actually handle the chat if you decide to make it live.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  And all of that gets set here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And this whole part is where you do that entire configuration. What you are looking for is chatbot, the option two options below this… chatbot, so that's your flow creator. So top, right? You've got a sample flow. You can check out.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  It's a video.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay. I just can create the flow here and then we'll go through it. I'll watch the video and do that. Okay. No, this is great. I love this and I will continue to build out our knowledge base. So, as far as so, in order to use those tools, this is what I have to upgrade to.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So that is a paid add on at 20 per user per month and it incorporates the entire suite of AI features, right? From AI agents, AI co pilot, the combination of both of these. And additionally, before the end of the month, we've got AI QA that's notching, and we're also have on the roadmap before the end of this year, we have AI tasks, AI answers, and we're going to be working on AI insights as well pretty soon.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  How long does that pricing like, stay?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, just give me one minute. Let me check if you're on the monthly or annual, that sense of things. If I remember correctly, you are on annual, just double check that. Yup. So as it stands, your current renewal is July 26. So this pricing of 20 usd will hold true till renewal. I don't necessarily see too much movement at renewal, just looking at the way and the pace at which we're building things off. But, yeah, it'll hold through till July 20 26, your contract period.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  And then can I add one more question about users? She's… no longer.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, this is a feedback form for us to get business intelligence.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  That's all, she just doesn't work with us anymore.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  so, as far as users are concerned, so when it's 20 dollars per month per user, it's this group.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, just the active group on your account.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So… actually… see that's where I'm going to like. This person. Doesn't I'm, going to take her out because she doesn't need to be, see like all she needs to do. She's using a shared inbox in order to see when, why your transactions come in. So I actually can take her out because I'd probably be better to just create a Gmail… inbox of some sort that she monitors as opposed to doing this because it's there's no two way interaction.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Well, yeah, I mean, like if that's the perspective, then, from a cost saving angle, that could help if you are going down the typical Gmail route, then you don't necessarily need to create a whole inbox with a paid user license as well. What I'd recommend is maybe have a Google group, have that routed to the group or these emails routed to the group. And that way they get forwarded to her Gmail inbox directly and she can do filters and all of that fancy stuff from there, yeah, cause.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  I was thinking like she's like just from a, I mean, we have other people that would, should be in here but not… so beta. So I'm going to delete her. All right. And then I'm just going to put downsizing the team. I mean, whatever, but I have other people that I do need to add to this. So, when I upgrade, if I upgrade you to the hiver thing, it's going to charge me based on who's in here right now?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And any new user additions, it'll all be.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Like if I add a user, it'll say, okay, great. That's 100 and whatever dollars or something like that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Basically, yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, do you have an idea of how many more people you'll be adding?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  With… probably just at least one, maybe two at this point. Makes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  sense. I'm just asking. Yeah… no, yeah, that makes sense. Nick. So, what I'll do is you've got like nine more days left on the trial if I saw that correctly. So, what I'll do is I'll just like, you know, if you want, you can have the two extra people added before the trial ends. And that way it happens as a single billing for like the 20 dollar add on when ready, right? If not as well, I can see that you've purchased five licenses total on hiver, so you don't have to,

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  yeah. And I think the five is right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly. So you don't need to pay any extra on the 49 plan that you're on for these two new users, you're just swapping out all the people for the new ones the AI add on will be charged for like the five people as a whole when it goes through. Yeah.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay. Yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. So, yeah. So that's I think that puts us squared away. Anything else for now, Nick?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  No, that's it. I would, once we get, once I get this part done, I'll schedule, you know, another time to look at everything again to see how we're using it, I know, you guys keep,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Pushing.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  out new features and I'm always interested, in learning more. I mean, I've been very happy with hiver as a platform in general. So, I'm happy, to use, you know, what we can in it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Done. All right. That sounds perfect. Nick. And when you do grab some time later on my calendar, can we maybe plan for like 45 minutes or one hour? So we have sufficient time to run through things end to end?

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. All right. Feel free to schedule a one hour slot. We can cut it short if we need to. And if you don't find availability for a one hour slot, just drop me a text and I'll have a meeting scheduled on your behalf.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Okay. That sounds great. Appreciate it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  My pleasure. Nick. It was a pleasure chatting with you as always. Stay in touch. I hope the chat bit works out for you. Any questions as well? Send them back my way, and at this point, I'll inform my team to have the 20 dollar add on enabled for you at the end of your trial.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Yeah, excellent. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. Cheers, man. Have a good weekend. Bye cheers.

Nick Thompson (nick@reverealtors.com):
  Bye.
