================================================================================

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Emily. Hi, can you hear me?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Hi, Jeevan.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hi, Emily. How are you? How's it going?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Good. How are you?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'm going very well. Thank you so much for asking how you're doing today.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah, we have a couple people who are going to join. I think it's going to be Mackenzie and Crislyn. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Mackenzie's here.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah. Hi, Mackenzie. But yeah, I just wanted a couple more people to see how hiver works because I think last time we tried it out, I don't know if you remember, we tried it out and we ended up not using it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Middle of October. Yeah.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah. So then we just kind of wanted to try it out again if you could kind of show us.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. I'm happy to take you through a quick walkthrough and we'll wait for everyone. Crislyn's just coming in here as well. Mackenzie. Hi, I hope you can hear me okay. My name is Jeevan. I currently lead the sales team here at hiver… Emily and I spoke, I think three weeks ago, I want to say.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I definitely keen to take you guys through like a quick walkthrough and see whether we can help you get started with another trial account. A couple of questions, Emily, so that I'm up to speed number one, is this for the same team that you were looking for back then, or is this for a different, more, a larger operation?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  This is for the same team?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. And, and… in terms of the first trial experience that you had, was there anything that particularly did not work that prevented you from some evaluating further or is there any factor that sort of like came in the way?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  I think it was the splitting of the inboxes. So I think we had like the orders go into one inbox, and then the info orders going into another inbox… that kind of messed with our workflow a little bit, but we also didn't give it too much time for us to try it out. So maybe we could try that again, but actually properly learn how to use it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And in terms of setup and in terms of how you want the inboxes to be structured and everything, we've actually kept that structure as flexible for you as possible. So, what that means? Is there's a default structure that we probably went with last time, but if there is a specific way, so you have an ideal picture in your mind, we're probably going to be able to get, very close to that.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Yeah, we just have, we have a lot of shared inboxes. I think we have around like five emails that are just shared. Yeah, that we just need eyes on for all of our inboxes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Got it. And so there are five inboxes. I mean, there could be more as well, but for the sake of this question, let's say there are five. Would you, Mackenzie, Crislyn, the group here be primarily responsible for all of those emails?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  No, there's also Leslie, I shared the link with her. She, I don't know if she is free to join today, but it'll be a couple of other people too.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. There's a couple of other people that across and I'm sure there's for example, Mackenzie looks after one or two of these emails more than perhaps others, if that is the case, right? So, what we can do is if you want these five inboxes to be, and I'm going to share my screen while I do this, if you want these five inboxes to be separate entities, we can definitely help you set that up or if you want each of them to, if you want them to be consolidated all into one, we can help you do that as well, or if you want to group it in a different way, say three inboxes get combined into one in one environment, and two of the other ones get combined into a second environment that's possible as well, right? So, I've just shared my screen and let me know if you can see it.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  We can see it.

Crislyn Kippes:
  This is per person not like on a like company level, right?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely.

Crislyn Kippes:
  All right. Wonderful.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. You get to pick and choose who gets access to hiver, and everyone who does not get access to hiver. They, their world doesn't change at all. They will continue operating like they always have.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay, great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So let's set some context, right? So I have logged into hiver, my name is Jeevan. So I've logged into Jeevan at hiverhealthdesk. Com. This is my account and all the emails sent to me directly go into my main inbox section. Over here. On the left. Right? Now, this inbox is complete, stays private for me. Nobody else gets access to it just because hiver is sitting in here. Now, where hiver kicks in, is below the inbox, you will see that there are a list of yellow colored hiver powered sections starting with finance operations… support, and a few of the other ones as well, which we're happy to dive into for the sake of our call. And for the example that we were just walking through, I want to focus on these three sections over here. These are what we call our shared inboxes. This is how we bring them to you. I currently am a part of three of them even though my account has a few more which I don't see here because I'm not technically a participant of them. So I only see things that I'm a participant of. And the three mailboxes that I'm a participant are really simple finance, HR and support. Now, each of these mailboxes currently have different sets of people. So, for example, the finance mailbox has a list of all the finance people. And me, the HR operations inbox is much smaller. So it's got the HR team and me and the support is probably our biggest one because it's got the support. It's got an engineering team and everyone. So again, you get to pick and choose who gets access to what. And if I wanted to sort of combine a few inboxes, for example, I could have an info at hiver helpdesk. I have a sales at hiver helpdesk. I don't want these two to be standalone entities. I want them all consolidated into support. We can help you set that up… right?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Isn't that like our regular inbox, like everything? I don't understand how this is different or helpful separate from the regular inboxes. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I'll dive in just a second and you'll see how it's different… right? So let's talk about this, right? So when an email comes in to one of these inboxes, let's say an email comes in to support at hiverhelpdesk. Com. Let's say you were to send an email and Emily, Mackenzie, Crislyn, if any of you want to send an email just to see how that comes in, feel free, you can just send a test email to this email address. So whenever an email comes in to support, it comes into this centralized folder over here. So instead of you all going into emails just landing up in your inbox, and you having to CC the group, CC the team for you to inform everyone else, hiver gives you a shared environment to work out of which has a lot of organization AI and delegation options, right? So let's say this email came in, I think last night and whenever an email comes in, I can open this email, I can read it. And on the right, I will have this find this hiver side panel. This side panel will help you bridge a lot of the gaps that your team is running into on a day to day basis, which is essentially if you're doing a lot of additional effort to keep everyone in the loop, that additional effort is no longer required because hiver takes care of that. And also our AI is running on it. If you'd like it, to do a lot of the processing, come up with a response for you before you even open that email. So the first thing that once an email comes in, our AI will detect what tone that email is in. So if you've got a frustrated experience or a really positive communication happening somewhere, we will let you know immediately. And of course, for negative emails interactions, you can always like set up alerts, so people can jump in. So those are the kind of things that you can do. But essentially, once that comes in and it's been processed, hiver will automatically like give you the option of delegating and working together as a team right here. So what you're able to do Crislyn is answer three very fundamental questions with this side panel. The first of those questions is how… who is handling, who's supposed to be handling this email? So when you're doing that, you can go in here and click on assign to.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Oh, I see. So like Emily could assign it to Mackenzie for example, or assign it to herself or what have you?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  And then to my knowledge, it'll go to a separate inbox, right? Jeevan, once I assign it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So let's do this. Let's assign it to someone, right? I'm going to go ahead and assign this to Cole. But the second I assign this to Cole, you're going to notice a couple of things happen. Number one, that activity is logged in timestamp. So, in case I'm on a day off and I come back, I know exactly what's happening on each of these emails. So I can stay up to date. Secondly, as soon as I assign this, that email leaves the unassigned section because it's no longer unassigned and it sort of goes into a different folder. Now, if I was Cole, I would find this email in my mind section because the mind section is very helpful for each of you individually because you no longer have to worry about. Is this for me? Is this for someone else? What's going on, right? And… you can come in here. You don't have to worry about anything that things we've already completed. You only want to see email that you need to be working on right here. And you have the, and I currently have one email in my mind section that I have to take care of. And the best part is if you are part of. So for example, you're part of multiple inboxes, you can actually get a consolidated mind section across those inboxes, or up here called assign to me, where it gives you a list of gives you access to all the emails assigned to you currently, across all inboxes.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  But so, I think the issue that I had last time was that email would just disappear from my inbox, correct? And it'll just go to like Mckenzie.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Not necessarily, right? It disappears from the main unassigned section. Sure, because it's no longer unassigned, if you are Mckenzie, you would see it in the mind section and for everybody else. So that we still want you to stay up to date with that email, you click on team and a team section, the team section gives you a list of all the active conversations that are currently in the loop.

Crislyn Kippes:
  And where's the one that you just assigned to Cole? Just, can you show… nice? All right?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So there's a list of these emails. The names of their owners are here as badges next to them. You can also see the sentiment associated with that particular email right here. And if you've got any slas running where you want emails to be answered by within a certain time, that can be running here as well, right? So this team section keeps everyone on the same page. If someone's on a day off, for example, if Rakesh is on a day off, I can click on Rakesh's name. I can see all the emails currently assigned to him. I can see all the back and forth that has been exchanged. I can see what's happened on that email, and I can step in and take over very easily.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. So what if someone sends an email to Mackenzie personally, but Mackenzie doesn't have time to take care of it. Can she assign a personal email over to like me? I would say.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So for, that personal email would have to come under hiver's purview for a second. So the first step there that Mackenzie would do is add it to a shared inbox. So I'm going to add it to support. And the second I add it to support, then I can then immediately the site panel transforms and I can immediately write from here without exiting this email without leaving this screen. I can assign it to someone on the team.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Nice. Okay. So, is there any way to just have like one shared inbox instead of like five separate shared inboxes? We have like we have like five, I think five info orders, accounting support, and sales emails?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  That we're all a part of, is there any way to just group all those into one one inbox? So we don't have to open up like five different tabs five?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Different folders here?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So very possible that those changes would have to be made on the Google workspace side. And it's very simple. We can definitely help you make them depending on how they're set up. I assume that they set up as groups. So it shouldn't be hard at all once the, so essentially, what would have to do, what would have to be done on the Google workspace side where the addresses were actually created? Emily, is, you would have to pick one to be your main account and you'd have the other four flow into that one. And then once you come to hiver, you connect the main email address that you pick to the shared inbox and have the rest of it as aliases flowing in here.

Crislyn Kippes:
  But wouldn't that change it for everybody then?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Even people?

Crislyn Kippes:
  Not using hiver because that's not an option.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  There is another option, in the middle as well. I just have to take a look at how this is set up on Google workspace. Okay? But yeah, there's definitely, we can cancel them.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, essentially, yeah.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  We would ideally like our own personal emails to be our main, like it should be our main thing like our personal emails, cause our emails are also attached to the shared inboxes, if that makes sense.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Can you say that again?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Like, yeah, like, our main inbox, like, I would want my personal emails to be the main thing that I look at.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Oh, of course. I don't I said consolidate, I don't mean your personal inbox coming anywhere in the way, I meant, out of those five shared emails that you have, you pick one among the five to be, the consolidated one and have the other four flow into it, and that's not going to impact your personal inbox. You're still going to come into your, Emily at email address and you're going to see that in the inbox. So, your main inbox is going to be the one that you see here on the left. Okay. Does that answer your question?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  I think so. But I think we have to visually see it. Okay. Yeah. Is there a way for us to, kind of demo it and see what that would look like and like for our team?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Excuse me. Sorry. I forget… that's the apps. Sorry, false alarm, second one. Yeah, we, absolutely. Thank you. We absolutely can help you, get on a trial. Like I said, would you have access to the group or to these email addresses right now that you could potentially show me so I could come back, with a gibl.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Yes, I can access the group emails, you mean, like in our, in Google admin? Is that what you're asking?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Yes, I can do that. Hold on a second. Let me pull it up one second. Then I'll share my screen. I just need to scan.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Nope. Hold on two practor authenticating me.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay. Let me share… okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can just go to the groups maybe.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Yep. All right. Which one do you want to look at?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, which one? Would you, so, can you tell show me the, you said there are five orders, and there's a few more than I remember accounting?

Crislyn Kippes:
  Accounting, at least in my opinion should be kept separate. I don't think, do you typically have orders that come into accounting Emily?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  No, but sometimes customers get like confused, yeah, like they would ask like accounting questions and like support or it's just, yeah.

Crislyn Kippes:
  I don't know, just to be really clear, I'm unlikely to be willing to change anything on, the at the, this level. Yeah. And I will.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Not, I completely agree. We don't have to change that. What I was looking for. And here's, my question, guys. I'll make this very simple. My question is, are there common members across all five?

Crislyn Kippes:
  Yes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We can take care of it. You don't have to change anything here. We can take care of it.

Crislyn Kippes:
  All, yeah. All three of us for example, are common members across all five.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Of them, across all five, right? So, what I would say is like you said, if there are different types of work happening in there, when maybe there are different people that are going to be involved, I would say keep those separate. For example, you would keep accounting separate. But when there are, when there are similar type of emails, for example, maybe sales, or orders, if those need to be combined, we can definitely combine them.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Yeah. We could probably do accounting separate and then like support sales orders and info.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Info has to be separate too because info is where a bunch of our other stuff goes to. So it just, it gets a little dicey. Like all of our operations, emails, like ups, emails, things like that go to info, the two factor authentication and stuff. So I don't want to mess with that. Yeah.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah. But I think we have orders coming in through info all the time too.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay. And I guess if we're not doing it on this level on the, in Google admin and we're just doing it in hiver, like it doesn't matter because it's just.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Doesn't matter exactly. Yeah.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  It's only in hiver. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It's only in hiver, it's about how you're combining it in hiver, right? So let me go back to my demo environment, right? So we've actually got finance and HR separate support, has sales and info going into it ourselves, right? So when an email comes in, what you can do is you can automatically, this is all consolidated environment. We spoke about assignments. We spoke about team in the team. If you want to see, for example, you want to automatically categorize like this about, hey, is this meant for info or is this for orders or is it for sales? If that distinction makes is valuable for your team, we can set up that as well because technically they are coming into three different email addresses. So that's the differentiator that we can use. And whenever a team, when the team comes in, they can see who it's assigned to, they can hit reply. When hitting reply, they can use our email templates which are interesting for us to like show you because these are shared resources that you can use and customize. For example, I am going into this email over here and it's going to ask me. I'm going to say, Emily, so all I need to fill in is Emily, the rest of this is automatically put in. It's a very simple email obviously. But if I have a rough draft like this and I want to just like clean it up, clean up grammar, spelling and make it nicer to read. I can use our AI to improve writing. So it's going to take your rough draft and give you a better version of that and click accept. And the second you click accept, that better draft gets added in here and you can send it out while sending it out. You also have the ability to change the status. So you can either do it from here or from here. What this does is it gives you and the team the functionality to track progress really easily. So you can go in here and say if and when an email comes in, it's an open. From here. When the email has had some progress, you can change it to pending or closed based on that progress. Closed refers to completely resolved. Pending refers to anything that does not require any further action. But you're waiting for a response. So in those cases, it can go to pending. And the reason why this is so helpful is one it syncs across the team. So if someone changes the status, everyone else sees it and two, the way it actually ties… into this left panel, right? So the unassigned mine and team sections, they only contain open emails… right? They only contain open emails and from there, if anything. Changes from open, it goes to pending or closed based on the change that happens. And of course, the common question I keep getting asked is if someone sends an email, sends a response to a thread that is already marked as pending or closed, hiver will of course detect that a new response has come in, will bring it back to open and will bring it back to everyone's view in the team or the mine section.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. And then does that directly correlate? So, you know, how there's csat and NPS scores? And then does that automatically translate over to metrics as well to see like how quickly something is closed or?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So the time taken to close is directly calculated by the time taken to go from open to close right here. So that's how the resolution is tracked. And of course, at the end of the day, you can come in here into the analytics section and get an essentially drill down to types of metrics we give you workload, which tells you how much work your team is getting and we give you performance, which tells you how well your team is performing on that workload.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So in terms of these workload metrics, you get active, which are essentially how many active conversations happened in a particular time period. So, I've chose last 30 days. So here, I've got 110 active conversations out of them. 106 were brand new, which means that four came in from the previous 30 days. So it sort of like spilled over and we've already managed to resolve 87 of them. And if I scroll down, I get average response time, average resolution time where you're able to see. And of course, you can drill this down by users by tags. So you can see which is the most frequently received type of email. So you can get a tag based workload breakdown and performance breakup as well. So, for example, I want to see how we did on all billing related queries. So you can see 61 came in 57 were new, 52 were resolved. These were our average stats handling specifically billing. And as you can tell, there is csat here, which we do capture… constantly. So our customer satisfaction surveys are something that you can automatically send out when you're marking a request or a response is closed. So it will trigger a new email saying, hey, what did you think about this interaction? So your customers can come in, leave feedback and go on.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. And what does that look like? What does that survey look like? Is it quick?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Very… I'll show you. So it, this is, it sort of like is, let me just expand my screen a second.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. There's, a, it's a survey like this that comes in and you can automatically send it out and you can choose the kind of metrics you want with it. Let me just show you something is blocking my screen, okay?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Give.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  me a sec. I'll show you what it looks like on the back end. So… yeah, when you're setting up a csat, you can automatically ask it to come in and either manually add csat or automatically send it in all replies or automatically send it after the conversation is closed, so you can edit the text, edit, the kind of metrics you want, whether you want it to have a Smiley face or text. And then this is exactly what it will look like and you can automatically get feedback here as well. And all of that is captured by hyvo.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Cool. Okay. That's nice. And then in the preview screen where it says active conversations, are those just all emails or is it conversations that are pending?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, active conversation is essentially anything that has had at least a single email exchanged on it in that time period. So, between the eighth of October and the sixth of November, my team has handled 110 different threads of conversations where at least a single email was exchanged either from your end or from the customer's end.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  So, like one reply would be one exchange, exactly?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  At least one, at least one reply.

Crislyn Kippes:
  And if we do choose to go with hiver, do you guys have an implementation helper? Like someone who comes in to help us absolutely?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, we've got 24 seven tech support. That is something we take great pride in. So, anyone on hiver, whether you're on our trial plan, a paid plan, you get 24 seven tech support built straight into your account.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You've got wait times of less than one minute. And of course, during your initial implementation, we will have someone helping you get started from my implementations team.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. Good to know.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Trying to think if there's any other question. So, if we wanted to test run this… do I set that up myself? Then just like last time?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I mean, you can set it up yourself or if given that there is going to be a lot of different mailboxes and we probably need to like help you consider the exact structure. I would actually recommend getting on like a quick call and.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Having.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  that set up because just to make sure we dot the I's and cross the T's but yeah, you're absolutely welcome to set it up yourself.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. And then pricing wise, how does that look? Because I know you guys have different tiers. So everything with like the C set stuff that one's probably that one's in the higher tier, right? That.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Is correct. So the way we've built this up is we've got three tiers. We've got the growth, the pro and the elite, the growth is if you can still see my screen, I hope you can, yes, yeah, perfect. The growth essentially is for your standard, the email management, email organization aspect. So all your automations, your analytics that we spoke about, all of that is here, the pro is slightly more customer support focused like with the niche of customer support. So csat business hours where you can set business hours for your team, load any sort of load balancing stuff like that comes in with the, to the pro. And of course, SLA analytics, csat analytics, all of that is right here. So that's those are the two differences.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. And then I think Chris and David was interested in like the chat box in the right, you know, how in the bottom right hand corner, you guys have like got any questions? I'm happy to help thing? Yeah, our.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Chat is also run on this, right? So we have our own hybrid chat system which is run on our product. So this is what our product would look like. You would come in here. You can start a conversation with my team and they would be right there and it will get assigned on your end in a format like this, right? So anytime an email comes in, it also a chat comes in, it comes into Gmail just in the same window. And you're going to be able to go in here and to access your chats and so on and so forth.

Crislyn Kippes:
  And which tier is that included in that?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Is on the pro plan? Yes, that's correct? Okay.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay. And.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  you get you.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Help with, the setting that up on our web page as well.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We do. So. Yeah. So this is how the interface will look. So you'll say who assigned it? You can set up bots and everything. But absolutely, we will help you set it up because the setup is actually fairly easy. So it's literally, what we do is we give you like, a code snippet that you just need to paste in the body tag of your web website code, literally copy and paste it. And that's it.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  No way. So, do you guys work closely with Shopify too? Like because we would also be using Shopify for this?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, in what way, in terms of hosting it on Shopify or like we do have a Shopify integration, but I want to make sure that it does what you need it to do Shopify?

Crislyn Kippes:
  Is where our website is hosted from?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, yeah, you can definitely go in and just paste it, in the website code. Okay?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. That would be really helpful.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Do you have any kind of slack integration where like if a chat comes in, we can have it notify a slack channel? Yes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So, we've got, let me just show you in our integrations page. We've got Shopify. We've got slack, will send all hyper related notifications not just chat but any other notifications you choose as well straight into your slack channel. We've also got Shopify where if an email comes in from a particular customer that's got an active order in Shopify, we're going to be able to automatically bring in order information, customer information, line, item details, order, statuses, all of that, and sort of load them up here. I don't have Shopify enabled in my account, but we do have, let me just one second. We do have like Netsuite enabled and it's pretty much the same thing where if a purchase order comes in for any of us, we can automatically gauge that in Netsuite. So I can go in here. I go into the app section here and I will be able to see all the information from any of the apps I request.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay. We're currently switching over to acumatica. Do you happen to have integration with acumatica?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We currently do not, but we do have an open API that you can always look at because if acumatica has one as well, but we've got with Netsuite, woocommerce, Shopify, we've covered the bunch there.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  So, what does that do? Exactly? What do you mean that it integrates to Netsuite or Shopify because you said Shopify too, right? Yeah, yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, I'll show you Netsuite, right? So for example, let me go to Sarah, right? So let's say Sarah has sent an email and that email is possibly potentially in our system. So what hiver does is it automatically plugs into Netsuite or Shopify or whatever system you're using. And it looks and it checks for information in that system related to that email address or related to the order id, and it will grab information about that particular person straight here. I.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  See. Okay. So it's just an info grab.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It's an info grab, but you can also like create items in Shopify, create items, in your CRM. So it is like a two way bridge between both products without have without having you leave Gmail. I.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  See. Okay. Yeah.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. That makes sense.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Do you have like a brief demo or brief an information packet so that we can just run it by our CEO and make sure before we move forward?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I set a little bit of information across to Emily last time, but I'm happy to put all of that into another email and send it across right at the end of our call. Yeah.

Crislyn Kippes:
  That'd be great.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  For me. Yeah, that'd be great.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  For sure. Okay. Anything specific you'd want us to like include in that?

Crislyn Kippes:
  The pricing, if there are, there, is there any kind of discounts that we can get on the base pricing?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. How many, potentially, how many people would that just so that I can send over some number? I.

Crislyn Kippes:
  mean potentially it's currently, we're a pretty small team. So it's probably going to be between five and 10… at the most at the moment. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So we typically, so just to make things easy for everyone, we typically build in buckets of five. Okay. Right. So you'd either purchase five or 10 to begin with. And at any point, once you're in the 10 bucket, I definitely have a lot of flexibility to go back to my deals, desk team and get sign off on and the five user mark, as you can imagine that's something that I want to get a little bit of pushback but I can always check and the 10 user mark 100 percent, we can definitely work out like a custom pricing model for you.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay. Well, if you could see if you can for the five user mark because, I think that's likely what we would start with though we are working on increasing our team. So we would eventually ideally go up to the 10. But if you can try for the five appreciated.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So here's what I'll do, I'll make sure that I want to first make sure that we pick all your boxes. So I'm going to go put this information together and maybe, we can get started on a trial kickoff call, maybe sometime next week or, whenever your team is available. And I'm on pto tomorrow, but I can have someone from my implementation team definitely come in and help you out.

Crislyn Kippes:
  It's it's okay if it waits until next week, our CEO is out until then. So like we're gonna have to talk to him about it as well, but, I do think that, you know, knowing if there are any discounts that we can get would help us decide on it because we are evaluating multiple. So if you can ask them about that and try and put that with the information, that would be appreciated. So that when we're giving it to him, we're giving him the full idea.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Yeah, absolutely. So like I said, yeah, I usually get a bit of pushback but if you can, if there is a specific like, I, what I would love to do is to go back to my team and say, hey, can we get it down? Can we make an exception, get it down to this number for a customer? And that's an easier question conversation for me to have. So if there is a specific number that is maybe like a tentative like for a threshold that you are looking at because given that you said you are looking at other competitors as well, that might be helpful.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  But yeah, give me a day. I'll probably get back to you on that. But in the meantime, I definitely send over, the information right now and then we can go from there.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Okay. Thank you.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. All.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Right. I don't have anything else to add. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Thanks. So, Emily, when's a good time for me to circle back for an update just to see where things are, and of course, you can always reply to my email if you want to take me up on, the trial setup call and anything else you need. But in the meantime, can I just settle back with you maybe sometime next week or week after?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah. So we could probably set up a demo call probably on Monday or Tuesday when David gets back as.

Crislyn Kippes:
  Well, I think at least according to his video currently, so I would say Tuesday?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Tuesday? Okay. Yeah, Tuesday would work. I could email you and schedule that separately and then maybe we can get like a trial set up at that time and then we can kind of we.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Can do a quick run through, answer any questions and then jump straight in. Okay?

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay.

Crislyn Kippes:
  All right. Sounds good.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, Emily, I don't think I have Christina Mckenzie's email. So I'm just going to send the information to you. But if you want me to send it somewhere else, you can just drop emails, in the chat and I'll have that sent over. And in terms of, yeah, yeah, go ahead you.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Can actually send it to and just do it to info because I feel like that's the most generic like everyone gets that email. If that's okay, info at futures. Com. I just put it in the chat.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no worries, that should be completely fine. I'll send that to, I'll send that to the info. I'll CC you on it as well. And if there's anything else I can help with, let me know for now. I will reschedule this invite for Tuesday at the same time tentatively, just so that we've got something on the calendar but I'm always happy to reschedule as like schedules and everything. Yeah.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Okay. All right. Okay. Cool. That works.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Thanks, everyone. Okay. Thanks thanks for jumping on. Have a great day and I'll speak soon.

Emily Hong (emily.hong@filtrous.com):
  Yeah, thanks soon. Thanks, Jeevan. Bye.
