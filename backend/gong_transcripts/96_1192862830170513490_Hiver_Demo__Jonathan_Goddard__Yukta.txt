Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Jonathan.

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  Can you hear me okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Now, I can hear you. How are you? Okay?

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  Very good. And my colleague Laura is going to join. She's kind of helping me with some of these email… integration… issues that were challenges that we have.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. You did reach out to our support team, right? In regards to that?

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  Pardon, yeah, I think I might have. So we were, you know, we're sort of replatforming many parts of our company. You know, our ERP is going to be Microsoft dynamics 365 business central, and we decided to, you know, add the Microsoft 365 business office component, which means that, you know, we can kind of lean into outlook which we're kind of happy to do because we've been running Zendesk for probably a year or two and I think… we just have too many silos of information around. And so it's very hard to, you know, jump around and so we thought well, let's see if we can do outlook. And so far we've set it up and we've got our email accounts in there and it's working. And today is this morning, they're using outlook and not using Zendesk for the first time. And this is our team of two other people. So there's four of us total… and so, but, you know, we know that the ticket aspect is important to us, but we also believe that outlook is very important because of the co pilot and outlook's integration, direct integration into business 365 or what is it business central, right? So a purchase order comes in, you can make a couple of clicks and, you know, it starts to save a customer record. So, you know, for that reason, I think we want to stay in outlook but I saw that hiver can work from within outlook. Is that correct?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No. Hiver does not work within outlook. We have two products, one for Gmail and one for other email providers including outlook. So for that, we have a separate standalone URL on which you'll have to go and then log in using your outlook credentials and that's how you'll be able to manage your shared mailbox and manage all the things there. So, yeah.

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  OK. Well, that may be an issue for us because, you know, we don't you know, we, because of this integration to business central, we feel like we have to keep our team within outlook at all times.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  OK. Got it. So, are you like sort of looking to get rid of Zendesk as well? And just continue.

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  Yeah, I mean, 100 percent, I think we're ready to move on from Zendesk, OK? And, you know, because I mean, it's honestly, it's just too complicated for us. I mean, we can use the macros but we're not able to get the AI and all this training and, you know, they call it AI, but really, it seems to me like it's just scripted, you know, like, well, if they ask this question here's, the answer. Well, I don't feel like that's AI when we have to type in the answer. So, so, and it's just too, it is a lot to manage and we're too small a company to kind of succeed with it to get the value out of it. So that's why we're like, well, let's try outlook and let's see if we can get a ticket numbering system working. I definitely saw like really neat user interface with hiver, but that was where I was like, gosh, you know, is that outlook? And then I kind of started playing with the trial and I'm like, no, this looks like it's another app, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I mean, it replicates a lot. It looks a lot like outlook.

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's a different platform that's why, you know, when you mentioned that you would, and there are a lot of people who would not want to switch from outlook, right? And they would want to stay within that and then sort of manage a ticketing tool if need be. So, I think there are tools out there in the market which provides that like a native integration within outlook to turn it into a ticketing tool in case you recall that. But yeah, I mean, for a small team of like three, four people, you would be able to manage a lot of things within outlook itself.

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  Yeah. I mean, that's the hope, you know, because we've got, I don't know our company has just acquired more and more email addresses to, you know, where we have like 12 in one business and we have another entity with like five and we're like it doesn't need to be this complicated. We can thin it down with maybe three per user and use some aliases for the old ones just to kind of dump it in there and then kind of sunset those email accounts or make them forwarding addresses and just bring some more like connectivity to the business because, you know, like we use Shopify and we use quickbooks and we use Zendesk and we use, you know, apple mail and we use Gmail, and we, you know, and we're just like spread all over the place and we're just trying to like and that's I think where, you know, we're just trying to tighten it up now. So we're not totally against the idea of hiver, but I think it's this integration with copilot and with business central that we think it's so important, right? And so you can't really connect business central to hiver. Is that right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you cannot.

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  Okay. So, okay. Well, I mean, I don't probably want to take up too much of your time. I really appreciate the call.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. John, if anything changes. And if you would want to probably in future explore a ticketing tool more simpler than Zendesk for sure, then we could always reconnect at this point. But as you start using outlook, I would also suggest to first explore that, see how it's working out for you. And then of course, you would know at the right time, if you would want to inculcate something like hiver.

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  Yeah. Great. Okay. Well, I really appreciate your time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. Thank you so much for booking this.

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  Thank you. Thank.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You. All right. Take care. Bye bye.

Jonathan Goddard (jg@widgetco.com):
  Bye bye.
