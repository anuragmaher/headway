================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  let's see. Is this your last call for today? Yes. Alright. I.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  have some things to finish up before I wrap up for the day. But, yeah, about fringe before she joins, you shared two options with her. I think 18 was the AI pricing that you had?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Okay. I don't think it's going to be an issue, but if she starts.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We'll discount it, no pressure. So.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  First.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  15 minutes, you can carry on the conversation with respect to the pricing and like,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  go let's go.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Hello? Alex.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Hello. How are you guys doing?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  I'm doing good. How are you doing?

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Good, good. Just like.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  The entire last week, it was so confusing. I just, I thought you meant like last Thursday. So I had sent out the invite for last Thursday and then I'm like, okay.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Totally fine. No. And I said Thursday because that's when, I was coming home that day and I was delusional thinking I wouldn't be completely exhausted from the week with the team and then traveling back, I was like, oh, I'll be home by three. I can definitely do a meeting.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  And then I was just like, yeah, that can't happen. It was a really good team retreat but, you know, it's tiring, you know, we do a lot and working remote, my social battery is not what it used to be. So, yeah. So thank you. Yeah, because I just was like, oops, overestimated my capacity there.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  No, no, no. I totally understood. I mean, when I saw the out of office message, I was like, okay, I get it. I get it. It's just a miss out on the date and I understood that if also we are scheduling something on Monday, it'll be too quick and we usually don't schedule anything on Mondays. So, I was like might as well just move it to the next Thursday and any, which ways with respect to the AI trial, we had informed them that there's a renewal conversation going on. So that was taken care of and yeah, I'm just curious. Did you get a chance to even like check you did? Oh.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Yeah. I checked the proposals and everything. Yeah. So I did look them over. I'm thinking that we aren't going to move forward with the AI add on at the time even though I do think it has like a lot of really great features and everything I think between the level of the team's adaption, rate, the… number of people who are actively managing… hiver in that capacity, it wouldn't be worth the extra cost and also just our volume because I definitely can see like our volume of email inbound emails because I definitely could see if we were operating in a more traditional call center or customer service way where we're getting a 1,000. You know, I used to work at a job where like we would get a 1,000 emails more a day that have to be delegated. I would definitely think the AI add on would be worthwhile but right now, as far as like actual inbound emails, like we get maybe like 12 a day or like and that are already conversations that are already started. So, I'm like I don't think at the moment it's something that's going to make or break our team. But I did try out the sentiment scoring and I did think that was really interesting. I did a little pilot of that with the team and everything… and like the tagging's really great.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  But I think, yeah, I don't think at the moment we're there for the AI add on and locking ourselves into that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, sure. And Alex, just a follow up question on that, you know, if it's just pure commercials in terms of the immediate increase in cost, you know, I could definitely explore with my team, you know, with like a timeline for like end of the month and see if there's like an additional discount I can send over just for like the AI add on piece, right? You know, if it's you know, just about a few dollars here and there and if it's like, you know, a little less.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean, honestly, I would almost be more interested in having like not the AI add on and seeing if there was like a discount for just like our annual plan too, just because I do see we have. So when it says the quantity 10, I assume that's per users per year, correct?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, the cost is per person per year.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Per year? Yeah. Because when I, and I think about how many people like out of our 10 users, like some people just use it really, you know, we're paying almost a 1,000 dollars for people who just really use email templates. So I would almost rather like our discount, go towards that than the AI, which I think is definitely in like a future state for us. But I think right now the team we're using hiver in a pretty basic, very impactful. It is like we are not getting rid of it at all because like it is a huge crux of how we operate and everything and all of that. But I just think between that add on and then just the level at which folks are using it at the moment, I don't think we're quite there yet. Yeah. And I would rather see if we could potentially do a like transfer any sort of potential discount to our initial plan. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That would be, you know, just to be, you know, fully transparent with you. The AI piece is literally like the very new version of things on hiver. It's the fresh features. So obviously, you know, as a business we're driving for better adoption which means we get to shape it up better. And that's why I have a little more room in terms of a discount on the add on. Understood. But with that said, you know, what I wanted to just check with you first off was are you leaning towards the regular annual sort of renewal one year or are you leaning more towards like a multi year deal?

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  I think at the moment it would probably be a one year but seeing like once, if we're removing the add on and just seeing like what that cost like breakdown is and everything on its own. I assume it's just the five percent discount and then just removing it. Let me see. I have it pulled up here for the two year it's.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  gonna be like 75 on the base plan and 18 for the add on if you're doing one year. So like 93 was the price that I'd quoted initially.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Right. Yes. So it's looking, yeah, sorry, go ahead. So for elite year one, it's a 10 percent discount. So it's knocking off about 500 dollars. And then for the second year.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's the two year one, yeah.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Yeah, the two year one and then for the second year, it's five percent. I think at the point, we would probably be looking just at the one year for the moment. I would, you know, I would chat to see because we're gonna get like the updated contract and everybody see if two year is. Because again, like we really don't have any intention of moving away from hiver at all. So two year could benefit us. I mean, I know that locks us into a deal and then we would reevaluate it after that, but yeah… I don't know. I would have to see the updated contract there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Yeah, no.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  It's definitely a possibility like something we would discuss internally like whether or not we would want to.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So two things that I'm hearing even if the AI add on is pretty deeply discounted, it still does not as it stands right now make a meaningful enough impact that would help you make a decision on purchasing it or adding it to the total as one part of it. So that makes sense for the time being. Yeah, right. And on the second part, it's just going to be revisiting the quotes on an annual multi year just with the base package of elite. And I'll still see if there's any additional discount. I can add maybe a few percentages here and there, a couple of dollars on the multi year deal that'll be the more, you know, straightforward route from that side of the business, right? I'll see if there's a couple extra discounts like a couple extra dollars I can knock off on the multi year deal in itself. See if that's more conducive in the long term. And if that's not, then, you know, if it's just an annual one year renewal, then we would effectively be looking at it as a separate piece in itself as.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  It stands as is. Yeah, yeah, and for sure and full transparency, I think the AI stuff is really cool and it's interesting and relevant to me. I think it's I think it's again the adaption rate for the team and like having everybody like it's relevant for my role in cool things, but I don't know how much everyone else is going to be using it and then paying on the user rate for it and all that. That's really my, only it has nothing to do with like the actual product… itself and like how it's going like, I think it's really actually very cool everything that we've been testing and seeing. So that's why I'm hoping down the road we'll be a little bit more ready for it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. No, that makes total sense. Cool. I mean, you know, that makes sense as well, Alex. So what we'll do is as confirmed. I'll get AI out of the picture. I'll see if there's any additional discounts I can add on the two year deal, right? See if that's helpful. So that way, you know, you get a better per user cost and predictability in terms of what the two year contract would look like and what that percentage would look like. Curious though, are we still kind of working towards a confirmation before thanksgiving? Realistically? If that's.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  yes, yes, I would like to. I am on Sonali's level of just trying to have as many things wrapped up before December as I can, especially since we do close for the last two weeks of the year. So I'm just like, oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  sweet.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Yeah, yeah. It's nice. So, yes, my goal is to have this wrapped.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Up.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Settled before thanksgiving, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Just one thing to add on the AI side, I mean, I totally understand your point of not moving forward with it and that's completely fine. I mean, it's just the volume of emails that you receive right now which is not a lot, and that's the reason you might be feeling it. I just thought of adding this. I mean, like a lot of customers have the AI roadmap that says that there's something known as AI insights that's going to come in like the next quarter. It's almost in beta testing in this quarter. And then it's going to be live next quarter. You have, we have built like the live dashboards together. So do you think that when that comes up, that would make sense to revisit the AI conversations again or do you think no AI is not something we are just not looking at it right now? Like just trying to understand?

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Yeah, I think right now if I'm trying to think it's something that maybe I would like revisit really like in like Q2 Q3 of next year to see where we are. Again, we just recently hired somebody that's just starting in new that's managing our inbox and like get in like we have like because we've just had issues filling that role, like and… just getting someone to do our basic sop… with like the basic things with hiver has been a challenge. And like the person we have now is doing a great job. But just kind of getting the basics down has been a challenge with managing the inbox again. Nothing that hiver does. It's purely a user issue. But that's why I feel like by then we'll have a good conversation, you know, because this person literally just started barely a month ago. They'll be like six plus months in. And like then I feel like I could have a conversation to them. Like what can we add on to make this role? Now that you fully understand the fundamentals and have the group like wouldn't AI add on be able to help you not only make your job easier but like enhance and take it to the next level. So, yeah, I would say like maybe around Q2 Q3, we can like revisit that and then I think it'll be good because then that'll give us the head… start on renewing. If we do a one year renewal or add on renewing the contract cadence as well like before the end of next year.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  That makes sense.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Which is crazy to think that far out.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  It's a lot of customers think three years down the Lane and it's so funny because they're thinking how many users they're going to add and it's so it's just a fun conversation always.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  But the best part is when they're looking forward and they're looking positively, it just feels like that's exactly how it's going to happen. So that's like the good part about it. But, yeah. Okay. So when you say you're adding like you added someone new. I mean, I'm not sure how are they getting trained? Like I haven't got any requests till now for like user trainings. So, am I breaking up or, is it like,

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  it could be me, you're good. Yeah. Okay.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, the screen was freezing. So maybe I thought it was my internet. Yeah, I'm saying if you've added like new members, do you want a training? Cause we do that, when you add new members, I basically come on a call, train them and what happens is basically around that time, you can also add other employees who want to learn more about hiver and then they can know the best practices and like that can be a good refresher for them. Like with respect. Yeah.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  I think that would be great. Is there a specific, is there a specific way you guys do the trading? Like is it done in? Is it kind of like we would just determine, hey, like a couple of people from the team want to learn about this or do you guys have a specific, almost like a courses or like not a course but like a session laid out that you do? Yeah, if that makes sense.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that does. So. What we do is whenever there's new user or like existing users want like a refresher training, I would give you like a one hour call where I'm taking them through the hiver platform like they're new. I would tell them that, hey, this is how you collaborate. Better. This is how you do tax better. This is how you sort of frame emails better or like type in emails better. And this is how you manage your emails better. Like this is how you create views and all of those stuff. So, on a user level, like there's nothing to do with, on the admin panel, but on the user front, what they should be doing? What are the best practices, how they can save maximum time, how they can use the features efficiently, that's like the goal and it's like a one hour call. We can get that recorded. And then eventually, when like new people are joining in, you can always show them that recording and if they have any questions. Yeah,

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  I think that would be great. I think like we could even like arrange for something like that in January. Just kind of like start the year fresh pick for people like here's a refresher. Everyone's rested from like coming back like, I think that would be a great, like even I would probably benefit from that. And then it also gives people, space to like ask questions. Yeah, I think that would be great. We could work on, a region. Yeah, basically, just like hiver using like one on one.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. So yeah, what I'm going to do is I'm going to have like the, we have a monthly sync.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  So on the January sync, I'm going to add this. So whenever we were connecting, we can discuss this and schedule it according to whatever the availability looks like around that for the team availability. Also just curious when you said that new people are joining in. So, I mean if there are like plans of adding more people like next year then or like next to next year, if that is like an estimate of, oh, we'd be adding two, three more people or like five people going forward. Then maybe Raghav can get a better deal with respect to like these pricings that he's giving out. He can frame those betters. There's also something known as bucket pricing. So we give that out when customers are like, okay, we want to go for a two year contract or a three year contract, but we are estimating that they're going to be three more people or four more people adding up. So then they give out a bucket pricing like 11 to 14 users. You pay this much, 15 to 20 users, you pay this much like different buckets are there. So that's also another option. So if you think that you're actively going to add a lot of users, I mean not a lot, but like still, you're going to add users, you can also look at that route.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Right. Yeah. Let me think about that because I don't think we're kind of like on a hiring freeze right now. Like the team, I think it's pretty locked in and set we did do this year like the totality of 20 25, a good amount of hiring or like right towards the end of 20 24.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  So, I think we are hopefully just set from that standpoint. I do think that is something to think about with just like the users because I think there are a couple of people on the team that don't have access to hiver that could benefit from it. Like I said, I think most of those folks would just be using templates… which I don't know like they don't have access to shared inboxes or anything. It's just sorry, it's just my audio. I could turn my video off sometimes. That makes it better. Yeah. I think that's where I just get hesitant like we just have a couple of team members that like literally don't do anything in hiver that they wouldn't do anything else in hiver except use the templates. And to me, I'm like is that I don't know if that's like worth like just in general, like worth having them on there at like that cost. That's where I kind of get because everybody that's currently on there has some sort of involvement with the shared inbox, the templates, the tagging, the assigning out to you. It's just some of, our contract coaches just would be utilizing the templates feature.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Alex, I understood your point. So you are saying that there are some people that are explicitly only using the email templates and they're not really doing a lot of collaboration, not really using tags and all of those features as much as I understand your point, but I don't think we have like feature based rollouts right now. So we don't like, so everything comes as a whole in terms of the package that the entire team is on. So say you are on an elite plan, you have access to a lot of things. Now, those lot of things may not be on a user level. It's also related to what benefit admin, like an admin would have, what? Like what of what all, you know, I would say limitations or like unlimitations admin has like its respect to that. Like in an elite plan, you have access to a lot of things like currently, you're in an elite plan. Now that pricing is based on the plan, you might have a number of users just coming in and typing their replies, not even using templates, but still, since they are part of the hiver group, where they'll be accessing all of these features. Now, using it or not is entirely on the team. What we can do is if they're only using templates, it will make more sense for them to also use shared drafts. I can like suggest these things which with respect to whatever their work, I would say work structure looks like I can suggest them more things to adopt that can make their work easier as in what hiver provides. But it is very, I would say it's just impossible to like roll out a different pricing for less use, right? Yeah.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Now, that makes sense. Yeah. Like there's no way to have like some users downgraded some upgrade, you know? Yeah, I get that for sure. No. And that's yeah, that's my point. That's why I'm kind of like I would love to add like maybe five more seeds so those people could have access to the templates, but then it's like, you know, that's adding almost 5,000 more dollars for people just to use templates, which like, yeah.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Doesn't.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  make a whole lot of sense from a business standpoint. Whereas everybody else currently uses pretty much the full breadth of the platform. But that I think is yeah, something to think about and just like, yeah… see where we are in the future state in a couple of months. But yeah, that all sounds good. What we talked about. Yeah, I'm definitely very much into the idea of having like a basic hiver training with the team and that's something I can start coordinating and looking to put on people's calendars honestly before the end of the year. Like we can connect in January to just like discuss more like what we maybe want to cover. But I know the sooner I can put things on people's calendars, the better, so that's something I can work on my end and then of course making sure it works for you.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Once the renewal is closed out, as soon as that closes out, we can have something tentative in Jan and then eventually like if that works out amazing, if it doesn't yeah, we can have something tentative in January already because in December we'd be meeting once and I would try to keep that like, yeah, if that's like necessary. Again today, we had plans to cover custom objects as well because we have already like pretty late with like today's timing. I'll keep that for the next meeting. Custom objects. Basically, if you remember, we had discussed, a lot of emails are received on personal email ids which should be a part of the shared mailbox. So there is something there's a feature that's already available to you wherein you can set up an automation. Any email that comes to your email id but is coming from a certain domain, maybe a client's domain which has to be a part of the shared mailbox, directly goes into the shared mailbox. It can still be assigned to you or like be assigned to someone else. But it goes into the shared mailbox. So that's an automation. We can create the entire goal for that is each time you're doing that manually. Yeah, Raghav, thank you so much. Thank you.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Appreciate it.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So the whole goal behind that is just to save time because every time you're manually going and removing it from a shared inbox and then adding it or like if it's not a part of shared inbox, you're adding it to a new shared mailbox, that takes up quite a lot of time. Like I do it a lot and that was an issue that a lot of customers pointed out. So then this feature was rolled out. What happens is you upload a sheet. This is not a dynamic sheet. It's like an excel sheet. It has just three columns. First column is the domain name, say I get like I have a customer that has domain fringepd. Com. And I'm the one who answers fringepd, always. So this email comes in and then this customer, he does not reply to the support at fringepd, instead, he writes to Sonali at fringepd. So in that case, I can just like directly set up the automation when every time he's writing directly to me, it goes to the support. And then if like, you can still have the option of choosing it to assign to someone else or like me but it just saves up that much time and it's with respect to all the users think you have 10 users and they would have, they would be having certain repo with certain customers. And these users, people would be emailing them directly, which would be they would be like sitting down and adding these to shared mailbox. If they're not, then doesn't become a part of the report that you're pulling in. So you'd not know how many queries they're answering if something has come into their personal inbox and they're responding from there, you'd not be able to track the response time because it's not a part of shared inbox. Gotcha. So that was the whole goal. Do you think this is helpful?

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Yeah, I think that's something that could definitely be helpful. And I think, yeah, like you said for like December call, we can like maybe like work through it, set it up and like have it, you know, to go like, I think, yeah, for December, we can do that and then just like maybe try to lock in a day that works for you for like the January thing? Yes. Yeah, just to like have it booked because, yeah, I think that would be good.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Oh, I think you froze?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you're back?

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Okay. Yeah, I think you froze, but yeah, I think that would be good. Yeah, we can get that set up for December.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, makes sense. I just, I'll just check we have something for December or not for the renewal part. I think we can just like discuss that over the email so we do not need another call for this.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  No, yeah. I think that should be pretty.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Straightforward. Yeah, yes, we have it on fourth of December. So that's good. Yeah, perfect. All right. Then that is it from my side. I'll just follow up with Raghav and try to have a good deal for you guys. Ideally discounts are provided on like multi year, so that's good. That's something I'm going to push him to. Yeah, makes sense to you. Amazing. If doesn't then one year is good.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Okay, perfect. Yeah, no, I appreciate it. Either way. Thank you.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. All right. Then, see you soon.

Alexandra Danay (alex@fringepd.com):
  Bye. See you soon. Thanks, Sonali. Bye.
