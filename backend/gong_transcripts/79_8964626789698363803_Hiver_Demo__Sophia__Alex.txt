Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  it's very nice to meet you Sophia.

Sophia Bonto (sophia@investwithrama.co):
  Very nice to meet you as well.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I'm Alex, I'm one of the senior account executives over here at hiver… my thought today, we can give you a demo, get you up to speed on our product, but would really love to understand kind of what brought you to the table today and kind of what you need help with.

Sophia Bonto (sophia@investwithrama.co):
  That's amazing. Our main focus… is drafting emails automatically in the Gmail because I'm actually not the owner of the account. I'm the assistant of the agent that is going to use that. So he wants to like before he can even open the account. There's already a drafted email automatically for him. Is that possible with your email not quite?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  It's almost there. So right now, it's still, I mean, you have to like click to have the email auto generate, but we have an AI agent coming out shortly that will do that.

Sophia Bonto (sophia@investwithrama.co):
  So you have to go inside the email first and then kind of like chat gpd then. Exactly. Okay. Well… for the time… itself, just want to ask like what's the pricing?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yep. So let me just show you.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, in terms of auto writing the email right now, it's this co pilot and.

Sophia Bonto (sophia@investwithrama.co):
  Let me, ah, it's like a in the side. Yep. I could ask my client if he likes that as well.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And right now, so we do this plus a shared inbox solution. So essentially, you could create use your client's email, make a shared inbox, and then you could draft these up for him.

Sophia Bonto (sophia@investwithrama.co):
  Put them in here.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And then you could share it as a draft. So he, you know, it is a little bit more manual, but you could draft up emails.

Sophia Bonto (sophia@investwithrama.co):
  Okay. Got it.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  In terms of pricing, we… have three different plans, but we offer, I would say like the growth plan, I don't know how many users it is, but if it's two people, it'd be 70 dollars per month. And that includes the AI composer. If you need the full AI agent in order to auto execute and write emails in the future… that's going to be under the pro plan.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And we have an annual payment in advance or month to month payments.

Sophia Bonto (sophia@investwithrama.co):
  Got it. Okay. All right. Well, that's just that because I'm really curious like how the email works for you guys because I'm still kind of looking for now to tell my client about the options. I'm definitely going to tell them.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yes as well. Yeah. And does the client just have like one use case? So, like, is it just to do this one thing or is there additional things to be aware of?

Sophia Bonto (sophia@investwithrama.co):
  I mean, just the, I think that's the main focus he, cause he really wants the email to be drafted for him. He doesn't know how to reply sometimes.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I see.

Sophia Bonto (sophia@investwithrama.co):
  That's the main focus.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Well, that's our offer. But, yeah, hopefully this was useful.

Sophia Bonto (sophia@investwithrama.co):
  Thank you so much for your time today. Okay? I wish Bob when it's have a decision, thank you so much. Okay? Bye.
