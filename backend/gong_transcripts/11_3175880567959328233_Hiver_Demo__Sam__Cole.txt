Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  hi, Cole.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, what's going on? Sam?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Not much. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How are you?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Doing well. Yeah, interested in hiver here mostly from a shared inbox, like the Google groups doesn't work very good for that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  So, that's kind of our main use case that we were thinking about. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  then I was curious, so I have it installed and stuff, but I was curious how we get to look at a group as opposed to just my whole mailbox.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, if you want, I can, you know, if you can share your screen, I can take you through some setup. I can definitely help you with that process.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  I'll go ahead and screen share here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can see that. Let's pull up the Gmail page.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  So, I have it up here. I have like said no to this because I don't want it being like my personal inbox. Oh.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, no, you actually want to set it up with your personal inbox, and I'll show you the rest because then we'll attach the Google group to it.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And then select all.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. So now, let's reach out to add some information here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, this is just like a general name. So whatever you want to name it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Next, yeah… connect email and then Google group, right? Yeah, perfect. And then just type in the group here and then you have to be either a member admin.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you have to be associated with it for it to sync.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Yeah. So I'm not sure. I'm just looking up the, I think it's just supply chain… yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Then you hit next… and then you can invite some teammates here too. So if you have some and how many people will be using this Sam for within the supply chain group?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Just, well… really just two. And then I'm like the admin. So like the third one, but I have a couple other groups. So we have like supply chain kind of not like our literal support email that's kind of managed by like a like… gorgias, but all these sort of more departmental type groups would be run through hiver is the intention.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So like probably have like five to 10 people on board or something like that.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Yeah, sort of in total across all of them, like each individual might be two or three but five to 10 across all. Okay. How do you do? Is it just, oh, I forgot to ask my question.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Does this matter?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  This stuff?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You can just, do we'll do this later… and then you see on the left hand side, see the supply and share mailbox. Now, you'll see the inbox, perfect. Yeah. So now those conversations will start to flow in there, that's a demo inbox, just to show you like dummy data of what like conversations look like and just kind of get a feel for it. So if you click into one of those just for an example, you see on the right hand side, you'll have that hiver tab where we can like assign conversations, track response time, statuses, collaborate. So you can click on that notes section right there. And at mention people. So if you want to like be like, hey, like, you know, at Cole, can you please, you know, come to this conversation and it'll send them a notification.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  So that's.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  kind of like the whole right hand side. And then, you know, as the communications start to flow in, you can click on tags to kind of like organize the conversation. So we'll see below the tag section. So you can create different tags for organizing conversations, creating different cues or buckets.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Okay. Makes sense. And this will just be future emails, right? It's not going to be like past emails into the group.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So just future, we do have the ability to import historical emails. So if that's something you're interested in, it usually comes with like a small charge depending on the volume, but we do have that ability if you'd like that.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Okay. I was going to send a test email here.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  And then will it also show up as like in like the normal?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes. So it can show up in your, if it's assigned to you, it can, you can create filters. So it doesn't show it kind of depends on how you want to set up so it can show in your personal or cannot depending on the view?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  You want? Okay. And how do we, there it is supply chain assigned test number three?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  What were you saying before Sam is?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  That a setting like a hiver setting or is that like a Gmail, just like a filter setting? I think it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Might be a Gmail filter. So if you go to top and, you can engage with our support team. They're typically the ones that configure that because they have a little more Gmail expertise. So if you click on the hiver settings button, top, right? And then go down to instant chat support 24 seven, you… can ask them that question, you know, how to do that. You can ask them any question here as well.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So as you're testing like this is a good resource to use. They typically respond in under three minutes and they'll also hop on a call with you.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Okay. Sounds good. That's great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, you can, if you want to do a send as, you know, shared inbox id, we can do that as well. So if you want the clients to always just see like, the Google group domain, I have a good help article that just kind of walks you through that. I'll send that in the zoom chat. So this is in the zoom chat just provided the, you know, send email as shared mailbox id.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  I'm just gonna put that on my other monitor.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we do have the analytics. So if you click on those analytics below the inbox,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  let's see like right below. Yeah. So there's not gonna be much in there right now, but as you continue to use it, and then you can click the top left, cause this is just showing the demo inbox and change the, those are dashboards. Yeah, right there, and they're gonna supply chain. So this will just show some standard out of the box reports. So like conversational analytics showing you active new resolve conversations, performance analytics below. If you see like the first response and resolution time, and then on the left hand side, those are all the out of the box reports. So user tag reporting, contact sentiment. We also have SLA analytics and customer satisfaction out of the box reports. Once you enable those on the backend, if you, if you're interested. And then these custom dashboards and reports as well.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then go into the admin panel. Yeah, click on the admin panel on the top. So this is where you're gonna click it one more time actually. So this is where you're gonna set up the platform, right? So setting up the channels, the automations, you know, the whole backend to set up, you know, for your specific workflow. So click on shared inboxes top left, and then click on supply chain. So this is the menu and settings for this specific mailbox itself. So add in the user. So you'll see that middle menu right there. We can do like auto assignment automations. We have AI capabilities. So kind of clicking on all these, we'll kind of give you the option to do certain things and that's some of the settings have switches on the top right? So if it looks like it's like blank, you can click that switch top, right? To enable the round Robin.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Makes sense?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, you know, standard workflow automations, where it's like, you know, conversation comes in subject line contains, you know, shipping, let's assign it to this person who deals with shipping requests or like something like that.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  And then, so settings.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  So, this is the one… so that'll send it as the email address, okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the slas are pretty helpful. So if you want to make sure things don't slip between the cracks, you can create a policy where it's like, you know, if we don't respond to an email when it comes in within one hour, let's escalate and notify the manager or something like that?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Makes sense pretty straightforward though.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's pretty much the main things. And as always, you know, I'll send over some help guides and some things that would be helpful as like you're testing just kind of like best practices and stuff like that. When are you ideally looking to go live with a solution like this, Sam?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Pretty much as soon as possible. I think you guys and I forgot the other brand, but we're like the two main ones for this. And then, yeah, just the Google groups aren't working. Yeah, collaboration. So, and it's annoying setting up a whole new user accounts with delegated access and all.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That. Yeah.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  So, yeah, immediately, like within the week would be the go live?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Would you want to touch base maybe on like Friday to discuss like the plans and what kind of makes the most sense going forward? Sure. And I can do, let's see, are you esc?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  I'm Mountain Time?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You're Mountain Time. So it's a 1,213 for you right now? Yeah.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  And actually Friday, I am out of office so we could do either like a Thursday or like Monday or Tuesday next week?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I can do Thursday same exact time as now if that works that.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Works. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I'll just send this over for like a pricing conversation and then awesome. So I just sent that over for the sixth same time and then I'll follow up with some more information after this, Sam, and it was great to meet you and looking forward to touching base on Thursday.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Sounds good. All right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Is there anything I guess? Is there anything else that I can answer before we jump off today?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  We can get more into this on the next call. But just, I guess to clarify this is like… me, for example, me, Steve sahab, like actual employee emails would be like this. And then like the Google groups don't count.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. So you get with the growth, you'll get up to three Google groups that you can manage pro is five elite is unlimited.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Okay. Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then we sell in buckets of five. So it's like 510, 15, 20. I know you'd be buying a couple additional licenses, but I can provide you a discount because of that fact.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Okay. And then does this plan support the groups or is it the growth plan that does?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The growth plan? Okay? For what you're looking to achieve, I would recommend the growth plan for sure.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Okay. Sounds good. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I think the pro, you know, you can always upgrade to the pro or elite later, but for what you're kind of covering now, the growth plan should suffice.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Sounds good. All right. Thank you very much.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I will, I'll talk to you on Thursday. Hope you have a great week, Sam.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Yeah, you as well. Okay. Bye. Okay.
