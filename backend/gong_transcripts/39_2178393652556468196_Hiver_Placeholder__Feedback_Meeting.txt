Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, Sebastian. Good morning.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  Sorry, I was muted. How are you?

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  Good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you. How are you doing, sir?

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  Yeah. Well, yeah… I've been enjoying using hiver. Great. Yeah, that's good to know. So, it's been positive. Yeah, lovely. I think Johnny's coming… in now.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  I have a question. You cannot close emails… in your personal inbox, right? I couldn't find that option at least in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Your personal emails. Yes, you can simply archive it, but you cannot close it because changing statuses is a part of ticketing and that happens for your payables emails, not the personal emails.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  Yeah, that was my solution, archive them instead of close them, but just one.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Way, yeah, I mean, just get it away from your inbox so that you're not working on it, but if it is a payables email, then you can close it once you are done with the resolution. So you're right? Yeah. Hey, Johnny. Nice to meet you. Hello. Lovely. Thank you for joining. Okay, great. So, I,

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  guess we've been using it for a couple of days now, when was our last call? Was it on Friday or last Thursday?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we met last week actually. So, yeah.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Met on the first precisely. So a couple of days from now. Yeah. How has that been so far? How's the trial going for you?

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  Oh, well, I've been using it. Oh, sorry. Sorry, go on.

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  Well, you can go first. Sebastian. Thanks.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  No, it has gone well. It took a… couple of days to get used to some things and finding a lot of going to the help section, but they gave me solutions. So it's all set up. Now, I just asked Rakesh before you joined Johnny about being able to close your emails in the personal inbox. That's the only question that I had… and well, you cannot, you can just archive them. But I mean that's I was expecting that answer, it's just different status. But apart from that, I think the metrics work at least for me to see how I'm doing as well… and to be able to see the volume that is coming up and keep on track. I am confident in closing emails because I know that they will come up. So they've been consistently once a reply comes, they come back into my personal one because it's already assigned to me. Of course, we need more… time to start thinking how to split the inbox and how to think of more automations. The automations that I put in have worked so far again, getting used to just bits… and bobs there and refine them. But they have worked. So… all positive notes in what hiver gives, of course, that's, the one thing is that my other automations in Gmail that I cannot use like just pressing a to reply all or something like that, but it hasn't been a big problem.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Well, that's a positive feedback at last at the end of the day, as long as we know what's happening into the payables inbox. Most importantly, we know that these emails have been replied to in time. No emails are missed. You're able to collaborate with other folks in your team like Anne, for that matter. You know, there is a complete visibility in the inbox. I think that's the most important thing for you to manage the payables shared email inbox. So I'm glad to know the feedback, what's your take Tony?

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  Still a bit early, I think need to be able to see, it might be useful to be able to see… kind of the aging, how old the emails are in the inbox. So analytics shows, you know, how long it takes, how long it takes the first response, which is good, but there isn't anything about the outstanding messages… in there. Maybe you can create a new custom report for it. I don't know… when I say aging. I mean, for example, there's 100 emails in the inbox, right? 20 of them came today. 30 of them came yesterday and 50 of them came last week or 50 of them came longer than two weeks ago, something like that, so we can see which… ones are actually really.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  Have been really neglected.

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  Is there a problem with them? Is there any reports that shows that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think we can create dashboards which are live on basis of what's happening with the inflow of your tickets and the payables inbox? Do you mind sharing your screen? Johnny? Let me just take you through a quick creation of a live dashboard in analytics that's going to be very handy for you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Give me one minute now. Yeah, if you could create on plus button create, yeah, dashboard that's okay. And give it a name. It's a Johnny's dashboard or however you wanted to say, yeah. Okay. Now, we have got these metrics. You have got new conversations, the ones which are active resolved, could just pick up these variables. Let's say we want to do it on the active conversations or the new conversations. Let's say… all right now, this inbox says accounts payables on basis of the new conversations. And then you also want to group it by status that gives you a clear visibility on how many open pending closed emails do you have in a one specific dashboard tile on top of it, what you also can do is maybe just if you could go back and create another tile so that you have a one quick dashboard on new conversations maybe. And these are for your inbox payables. And here, I would say group it by different tags so that, you know, even if these are open pending and closed. What are these requests about at any particular point in time. So that's how you can just simply customize these conversations, the ones which are resolved, you can look at it by the resolution time, who resolved it? Who worked upon it, you can just group it by, you know, the names of these assignees. So, yeah.

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  I was interested in the aging. So, you know, messages received today, messages received one day ago, two days ago, more than two.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Days ago. Okay. Now, can I understand, how is it going to help you? I mean if I were to tell you, hey, these are the emails that you received today versus yesterday versus last week, as opposed to telling you that everything has been settled out of all the messages. We still have these open pending and closed. How would that help? I'm, trying to understand what exactly are we trying to achieve while finding out a figure, which message we did get last week versus today as opposed to the exact, you know, stage or status today?

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  So, if there's 100 open messages and they all arrived today or two hours ago… and there's none from yesterday or longer ago than that. That's actually, that's fine. It means our team is keeping on top of the messages and they're being responded to in a timely manner. If there's 100 messages, two of them came today, 10 of them came yesterday, 98 or 90 of them came, you know, three weeks ago. Then that tells us a different message doesn't it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Fair enough. Now, that has to do with the response to those messages. If these messages came in maybe on Monday and there is a huge spike in the beginning of the week and our team hasn't been able to respond to these messages in time that clearly says the first response has been violated because we have a policy in place that says, hey, we need to work on these emails in no more than eight hours or whatever those initial hours that we have set it up, right? So then we are looking at a reporting which is first response to those messages. Now, if you could just maybe go back, we could just maybe save and create it. And we can always come back to this and tweak it later also. But you have an option to go back to the reports and analytics and look at the SLA based reports. Right… now. This is where you could go ahead and sort the dates, date ranges for yourself. Let's say you're doing it for one week. All right. And you're looking at for payables account. Now, this is where you would see the response compliance and the resolution compliance. Now, can you go back to the, yeah, can you click here on the response compliance? Now that's where it says everything has been all? Okay? I mean, we have seen the compliance on the 20 eighth of January where we have been able to work and respond to all of those emails and resolve these emails in time. So that's 100 percent response compliance for you on the 20 eighth of January. All right. Apart from that, when you go to the conversation report, this… is where you see the active new and resolved conversation, like the exact workflow on the day's basis. And it clearly gives you a complete information, a holistic view of the new resolved as well as the active conversation. And if you drop down a little bit under the performance, that's where you would see all in all, what has been the assigned time, response time and resolution time. So this clearly is somewhat 14 hours which probably can be literally, you know, worked upon. We can be more proactive. Now, we can find out ways as to how long are we taking to assign emails to each other? Maybe if you could just click here for me, this tells me we literally take four hours on an average to assign conversation to ourselves. Now, there's a quick fix to it. If we turn on the auto assignment or maybe, you know, play around with certain automation rules. This can be shortened. And this gives you a view of, you know, the emails that are coming in today in your inbox… and if you customize the report that's where you can custom on basis of the number of days on active conversations. For an example, you choose a metric and you say all the ones which are coming in as a new responses, maybe, you know, the new conversations… and you want to filter it by assigning all because these are anyways assigned to any of your team members status is open because we want to find out what's happening in a specific day in a week and then has contained any tags as such. And then you can just maybe, you know, preview as well. Like you could just see these are the conversations that are happening and then group it by date. So you get to see what's happening in your entire week.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So you can always tweak around with these reports. You can customize the reports and filter it. And obviously, you know, save all of those. But if you don't want to come to these reports, you can always create quick dashboards and literally, you know, hover around onto the dashboards as to what's happening throughout the conversations in a specific day week month and you can toggle it between these working hours for your days. All right. Thank you. Great. Lovely. All right. Any more questions?

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  I have one sure. Because if we look back at the payables inbox in Gmail, like normal, it seems like nothing, you know, it would appear that nothing has been done, you know, like you have, because so it doesn't feed back to here. I mean, just the responses, of course, but is there a way for people?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You keep it more organized and clean?

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  Basically in Gmail, although I have to just manually clear everything in Gmail after like every now and then basically.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Yeah. I mean, SEP, do you mind sharing your screen? Let me share a couple of tips and tricks on how I use hiver every day to make sure I only keep the important stuff to be to do otherwise, the ones which I don't care about more or it's just a noise. I just clear them and there's an easy way to do so.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  I… swear, sorry, I think we work more with Google teams.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So there is a share button… at the bottom of your zoom screen right next to react chat?

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  There we go. Sorry, it's just because I haven't given access to share my screen. No worries… later. Cool. There we go.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  All right. So this is the untouched payables inbox. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, this says you have got 20 emails which are unattended which are like these requests not been assigned to anybody. Now, all you can do is if these are not been worked upon, you can first of all, go ahead and make sure who needs to work on it and you do the ownership so that we are aware of who needs to work on this. And if there are emails that do not require your attention, you have a select button option right in front of all of these emails. Maybe if you could just select a couple of these which are just fyi, emails… that does not require your attention, you can just select these ones for me. Okay? Just select it and do we have more as well?

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  Not that I haven't.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  checked yet, and then you can just change the status. You can even do multiple such selections and just maybe simply close them. That's all.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  I think my question was just, it's not a big deal to be honest. It was just regarding the, if there's a way to feed back to the inbox here for it to clear out because all of these have been seen, okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. So, what you're saying is when you log in into your payables inbox in your Gmail that's where you see all of these emails right there.

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  Yeah, but it has been dealt with.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I hear you fair enough. Let me take and get back to my product team. But what I literally see is that because we are working on these emails from within the hiver interface, it still has the numbers in front of it, right? I mean, if you notice these emails are worked upon, it's just that these are not read specifically from within this inbox, which is why it looks more cluttered. But all I would do is just simply select these and archive them because these have already been actually been worked upon in hiver. So you're not losing anything, it's just a replica of it. So that let's say, you know, six months down the line, you say we don't want to use hiver, you still have the entire information right in the main account?

Sebastian Aguirre (saguirre@mubi.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Any more questions from you Anna?

Nana Osei:
  No, nothing from me?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  How's your feedback on the tool? I mean, did you get a chance enough days for tested work on it? Yeah.

Nana Osei:
  I've played around with it a bit. It's fairly easy to use. I think I would have asked the same question as Sebastian just asked as it would have just been easier if it cleared off of Gmail. But yeah, you've explained that. So, yeah, everything's good. I'm liking it so far. Great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. All right, Johnny, coming back to you, what do you think is the next step from here?

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  So, we've got a few days left on our trial, right? So let's wait to the end of that, and then we'll have a discussion amongst us.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. All right. Absolutely. Let's continue with it and the trial is active until the fourth of February. Can we regroup on third of February, maybe on next Tuesday for a quick feedback catch up?

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  Sounds good. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. So I'll send you guys a quick invite, probably around the same timing just for a quick 15 minutes. We may not really need the entire 30 minutes and I would call it hiver feedback, catch up… any queries on the pricing. Although the pricing is like literally straightforward on the website, we could absolutely look at the basic plan to begin with. That starts at 25 dollars per login with a team of three to four people. We are looking at a bucket of five. So that will essentially be around 125 dollars by 12 months for an annual subscription. Did you get a chance to look at around it, Johnny? I mean, if you have any more questions, I can do that or I can maybe send that or send that to you the pricing information, on email as well.

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  Yeah, please send that, that'll be useful. Thank you. Great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. All right. I have extended an invite for our next catch up before the trial expires just for 15 minutes around the same timing in the morning on third of February.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And if you come across guys, any more questions, feel free to write back. I'm inviting Anna as well as Sebastian to the meeting, Johnny. You should have that invite in your inbox.

Johnny Tang (jtang@mubi.com):
  Thank you very much.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Thank you so much for your time, guys. Look forward to talking to you again. Should there be any more questions? Me being the first point of contact at hiver, please do not hesitate. Feel free to write back. All right. Thank you, Rakesh. Cheers. Thank.

Nana Osei:
  You.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Bye.
