Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Helen.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Hey, good morning. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I appreciate you. Oh, yeah, no, I appreciate, you know, hopping on the call here, Helen. So just to set a quick agenda, I would love to do a quick round of introductions. You don't understand your role. What got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demo, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  OK. So I already installed it, but I'm the acting executive director at the mertens fund. My background is I used to run an email company. So I've done a lot of email support… but this is a pretty small organization. I've done a lot of email support. I've evaluated a lot of support tools in my day. What I'm really looking for here is this is not a technical organization. We have a team of about four. And so what I'm really looking for was just like a simple addition to Gmail, that would let them avoid stepping on each other's toes, right? So we have three or four people grants at is our, you know, mailbox for everything coming in. We have three or four people using it. We had been using tags are not a sufficient solution at this point. So that's what brought me to hiver. Like I've used Zendesk, I've written custom software. We looked at helpscout last time we were evaluating software. But like what really Drew me to you all was that it would sit right on top of the email platform everybody already uses, and hopefully is lightweight enough that it wouldn't feel like we were doing a big software project.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. Now. That makes total sense. And you definitely came to the right place that's exactly, you know, why we were created for those teams, right? That want to provide email support while remaining in Gmail, right? Less platforms to go into your team's already in there. It's the path of least resistance. So just to understand it's pretty much just the grants inbox that you're looking to manage better. And are people logging in with their own individual emails or the shared inbox login?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Right now, people use their shared inbox login, but I would say everybody's got some amount of like crossover email, right? Like I get emails to my personal account, that is really grants, right? So, I would love to be able to shift mail out of my personal inbox into this as is appropriate. And I think that's true for basically everybody on the team, but that is really our single address that we want people to use and we want, right? Because otherwise, people go away and then it's just sitting in their own personal inbox, right? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. But everyone at the company has their own individual email, right? Like Helen, yes. Okay. Because that's what I saw in the trial, you have grants as a user ops and support all listed as users. What I would recommend is having their individual emails be created.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  So that is our individual email addresses.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  And our Ed, like uses. She likes to have everybody have a role address. So, like ops is my address, but Helen is an alias for it, right? All that stuff. And in fact, I set up a bunch of accounts and then had to delete them because it was like, oh, I invited Helen, but to log in with my Google account, I needed to use ops.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. That makes sense. But yeah, you definitely came to the right place so I can share my screen, just jump into a demonstration real quick and feel free to stop and ask any questions as we go along.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  I mean, I'll start with the biggest question, which is how do I like? What am I supposed to do with mail in the inbox?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Which, which mail in the support mailbox?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  No. So it's just in the actual factual inbox.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, in the source inbox, you can just leave it at B as you're using hiver, it can keep running as is we have a read write integration. So anything you do in hiver will update in the inbox?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Okay. So the goal is to get people to stop using the inbox?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Stop using the inbox, and just log in by having hiver because you can understand who's working, what people step on each other's, toes and all that stuff.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Here's, my next question right now, we do use the split inbox, and we kind of intentionally because we have things like people send us mail where we want to use the content for our newsletter, but it's not really a ticket. And so all of those go into promotions et cetera. Is there a way to just get the primary to go into hiver?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The primary and what is the primary inbox?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Like if you go to inbox here, and?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, you're getting the promotion so you can, right?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Google split inbox, right? So like I like the Google split inbox, we use it for certain particular things. And I would like to keep things that are in promotions out of hiver because they're just, they're not tickets. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's that's something our support team can assist you with that's. Definitely a combination of things we can do with hiver and just general Gmail settings that Gmail owns.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But going into the support share mailbox, right? So when you click into it on the left, it breaks it up those sub views, unassigned mine and team, yep, goals to have unassigned zero. So I'll click into one of these right here. And on the right hand side, that hiver tab opens up where you can do things like assign conversations, track the status, whether it's open pending or closed and showing nothing slips through the cracks, adding those tags for organizational purposes and analytical purposes. And then custom fields for tracking additional data as well. And then below that is the collaborative aspects of being able to collaborate internally with people. I'll send this notification to matt. He'll, get it up top right here. Once he clicks on the notification, it brings him to the thread itself. So you can click into these. It'll bring you to that thread you were notified on and you can keep collaborating on the right hand side. Okay? If I.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  started a draft here. Can somebody else who I tagged see it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. So let's say this is my shared draft. I'll just hit share draft right here and someone can come in and see this. Perfect.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But just want to pause right here. Like what are your thoughts on this so far?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  It's totally straightforward. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Cool.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  It's totally straightforward to me. If you have a video run through of this, I will say I did a bunch of the demo stuff and then it just seems to like stop at some point. So whatever I'm not going to give you too much feedback on my onboarding journeys.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And well, I have a bunch of videos I can send you as well. And I'm happy to, you know, do like a team training for the call if you sign up, so, you know, so I'm also happy to pose. And then if you want to ever contact or instant chat support email, you can click on this button right here and go to instant chat support. 24 seven. This is available. 24 seven, three six five to answer any questions that you might have as you're using hiver, they'll also hop in a call with you if you need assistance.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then going to the analytics, right? This is where we can do things like just report on the workload and performance. So, you know, active new resolve conversations over a certain time period. Yeah. What our average first response time was our average resolution time per user metrics, you know, emails assigned per user sent out per user, and then individual performance metrics below.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the tag analytics. So why are people reaching out? And what are the hot topics we're seeing across the grants mailbox?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And one thing I want to know also, you mentioned sometimes wanting to push things from your personal inbox, we can do that manually and also through automation, the automation feature is in our elite plan, but essentially, you can do it manually in our growth, which gives you the ability to do, you know, let's say, let me click on new conversation. All right. This is in my personal inbox, right? But if there's something that you think should be in the shared mailbox, you can just go over here and do add. Yeah.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Okay. Interesting. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then from there, it's going to live in the sports share mailbox for you to delegate and do whatever you want with it. Yeah. But does it seem like at this point, Helen? Like you will be signing up for hiver. Is that like the intended goal?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  I mean, it's tell… me more about your price plans. Like, right? Like this is, I would say not an organization that is looking to take on a lot of technology tools. This is super straightforward to me. And I also have three decades of experience doing email support. So like part of this is like, is this lightweight enough that people won't, just say, just let me go back to my regular email, Helen. Yeah, like I would say, even the analytics we're not like that's next year. Maybe if we're interested in that stuff, we're just.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  like tracking an assignment, like more tracking an assignment?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Right now, exactly, it's the assignment and being able to say this one is closed, right? Right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's how that?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Is the feature set we're looking for?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You're looking for assignment and open and close?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Exactly like truly and like, you know, as with many of these things, I think you start off doing that and then over time, people are like, oh, maybe this, we could do some more stuff. But like truly, it's like don't let the intern reply to an email I already replied to.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right, right. But so, for the pricing, I'd recommend the growth package for what you're looking to do, it's 25 dollars per user per month for an annual commitment. And then 35 dollars per user per month if you go on a month to month contract.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Okay. What's the, what's the difference between the free plan and the growth plan for somebody in an organization that's really just still figuring it out.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you just don't get the ability for custom fields for those tags that I showed you which are helpful for organizing. You don't get any automation features.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then no analytics.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Okay. So, I guess the question is if we let's assume we're starting on the free plan, what's the benchmark that says for most organizations that are coming from truly nothing to saying, hey, I think it's right? We're ready to step up.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'd say like once you want to start building in the workflow automations to free up your team. Okay? So whether that's sending automated replies, automatically closing conversations that come in, okay, automatically assigning conversations to people or just like sending notifications and stuff like that. So, okay, combination of the automations and then the tags, I think tags are pretty fundamental to what we do, right? You can create different cues or buckets or views based on those tags and also report on those in the backend. So I think those are the two triggers.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Okay. So I guess, my goal in terms of like the path here is effectively getting team buy in, right? Like I need to get them persuaded that this tool is useful for them before I, right? Because if I start off with you need to do tagging, you need to do this. And here's how we're going to do it. They're going to just reject it. So… sounds like what I need to do is be like you got to get out of the inbox and into this, right? And so that's a little bit like my first question was, because right now, it feels like they basically have two inboxes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Yeah.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  And then my second problem is making sure only things that make sense for them go into that queue, right? So like when they're getting updates in there, right? Like when they're getting like, this is also the mailbox that gets, you know, all the unlock codes for online tools, right? Like when a system says we sent you a code to your inbox, this mailbox gets that too, right, right? Right? And so putting that into a ticket is actually a negative.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right, right. And there's ways that we can also like close those out automatically to funnel that out of hiver. That is a possibility.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Yeah. And so what I would really like to be able to do. And so like perhaps you can have someone from support, just send me a help page or whatever is just say, like keeping those promotions, updates, social split views in Gmail. And then just say whatever's in the inbox goes to hiver, right? It doesn't take those things that go into those other slots and only the inbox, only the primary tab goes into hiver.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Okay.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Does that make sense? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For sure for sure? And I can definitely CC you in support after this, but.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Okay. Yeah. And so then last question, so for instance, if I archive something in the inbox, does that close the hiver ticket? Like how does that two way communication go? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I wouldn't recommend archiving because like closing conversations is our version of archiving in hiver. So the goal is to get people out of that flow entirely and just get them into hiver?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Yes. Okay. Yes. And if somebody forgets or falls back on their old patterns, the question is what happens?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It'll archive? Okay. It's a read write integration. So, what happens if that mailbox happens in ours?

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Okay. So if somebody archives it there or trashes it there, the ticket either gets closed or deleted. Great. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I know, I'm not your ideal customer who's looking for all the cool stuff you can do. And I know that you are working on all kinds of AI stuff and it would be great to someday have this tool take our phone calls and everything else. But today, my goal is just to get people going from regular email to a system with assignments.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For sure. Well, keep me posted. Like if, you know, you started the free plan, you find you want to move forward with the, you know, growth. We can always restrike this conversation but let me know how it goes with you and the team. We can always hop back on a call.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Okay, awesome. I appreciate this time. You answered a lot of questions for me very quickly. So, thanks very much for your input. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No problem. It was great to meet you and I hope you have a great rest of your week.

Helen Horstmann-Allen (ops@merchantsfund.org):
  Yep. You too. Bye. Okay. Bye.
