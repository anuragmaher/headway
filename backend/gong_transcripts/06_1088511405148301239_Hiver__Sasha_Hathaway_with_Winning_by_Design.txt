Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Sasha, how are you doing today?

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  Good. How are you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm doing good. There we go. Hi, I'm Raghav. I work with the account management team here at hiver. Yeah, I've realized that you've scheduled some time to go over the AI features and the cost, I believe. Yeah.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  Yes. Yeah. So I was just brought on to winning by design as their it and operations manager. And so I am doing kind of a whole systems audit. We use hiver really frequently but we don't use it to its fullest capacity. No one has set up any of the AI tagging or any of the automations in that regard. And so I would love to explore that and maybe have you walk me through how that works right now. We're getting a ton of support requests that just could totally be automated responses just by flagging and tagging what they are. We have like a whole document of like 100 different standardized emails for different types of situations, but no one has set it up. And so I know we need that, but wanted to chat through how that works. How that's set up. I've never used hiver before. So would love like a quick run through and then, as well as the cost of those AI features because I know I just saw on our account that we are almost on the end of our trial for that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So starting with the cost, you know, the AI features are pretty much a 20 dollar per user per month paid add on. So, you know, the way we're running it right now is we basically had it enabled on a free beta or free trial. However you want to call it for all of our customers leading up to October. And from the middle of October, we've basically started working towards a price point and ensuring that the transition is also smooth for our customers as we go along, right? So the add on as a whole would include all of our AI capabilities. So unlike some of the other tools out there, there's not going to be a limit or like a metered billing or anything of that sort.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So when you do get the add on, it's going to be all features all encompassing both present and future roadmap items included. Yeah. So with that said, let me begin by sharing my screen real quick. Can you let me know when you see my inbox?

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  Yep. I got it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm just going to be video off because my bandwidth is acting a little conky today, but yeah, so effectively when it comes to hiver, have you had any experience working with like ticketing systems, and help desk and things like that?

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  I haven't not with not something like this. So this is all new to me.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, perfect. So let me start with the everyday basics there, give you like a quick five minute overview in terms of what things do and generally how things work with hiver, right? So effectively, we come bundled as a Chrome extension for Gmail as a platform and as a solution. And what you do get is basically ways for you to connect your team email addresses as we call it, right? They refer to our shared mailboxes. And all of these are effectively direct email addresses that teams use for common correspondence. Those could be emails you give out to external parties, your clients and vendors, stuff like info at payments at all of those things. And on the other side, it could also be more for internal departments and teams like finance or customer success, or operations and id support, and things like that, too, right? So that's essentially the kind of places where hiver has been used by teams historically. And in terms of an everyday perspective, what hiver unlocks is central visibility, better collaboration and just making sure everything is in line in terms of tracking handling and completion of tasks, right? So what we do give you when you connect one of your team addresses to hiver, right now, if memory serves me, right? You've got an inbox called training support, right? So essentially, what we do is we give everybody on the team one place to go in and track everything that happens inside. There's. Going to be different views or queues that would allow for you to understand ownership on these tasks or emails, completion status on these tasks and everything around it, right? So these queues again are going to be common across the board. And literally the whole team has full visibility across a certain inbox that you've got. So obviously, you know, if you've got different departments on the same account, you can control visibility based on user access and just running through a typical standard workflow. Once emails come in, team members would go in, try to see what that email is about and then delegate it or assign it out to the right person. Next up there's a status to track completion. So open pending and closed as three options. And there's a whole lot of ways through which you can categorize the conversation, you know, have it filed under the right type of query, it is type of inquiry it is and also have additional means of tracking anything else you'd want like what is, you know, the service level two or service level three that they've got there? What are the added services that they've all of that stuff, right?

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  I'm just going to pause you and you might get to this. Shut me up, if you are going to. So here is where I see they're potentially being used for AI for us because a lot of the questions that are coming in are just fall under these buckets where it's a very quick like custom or not custom, just automated response that could go off. But we're doing it all manually right now. And so I guess it would be like if, how I'm envisioning it is it reads the email and if it includes kind of these key keywords, it's going to tag it as this. And then this is the email that it responds with.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely, we'll just set it up in two different steps but that's effectively the context, right? So when it comes to AI tagging firstly with every AI aspect or element of hiver as a business, you have full control on what you train it for. And none of your training data would be used for any of hiver's customers as well. So it's more of an isolated environment of sorts if I can call it that. When it comes to training and re usage of the context, and that's the guardrails that we've got around the whole thing. So to your point, right? We can effectively have the AI trained on 10 emails that would give it like a widespread approach of, hey, this is the broad definition of this category, right? And step two of that is basically have the AI trained enough so that it can start adding the tags once it's categorized, it's like you asked, right? We can just basically set up a workflow that says, hey, if category one is added on an email, then I want template one to be sent out that's straightforward.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  Right. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  If it's urgent issue, for example, just to show you like a full workflow here… just leaving it as that. But this would be one of the workflows we create.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  That is awesome. Okay, great. Can you go a little bit more into the training aspect and adding those emails to train it on that tag and how let's just take like use one tag as an example and say, okay, just walk me through the process of adding emails to it and training that aspect?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. Yeah, definitely. So what you'll need to do is basically have the tags existing within hiver or create them from here when you want it to be trained on, right? And the whole training process is basically you going into the inbox, picking any email that's within the hiver, inbox, past emails, closed emails, open emails doesn't make a difference, right? Then emails apply that tag manually on 10 of those. And that's about it. The moment you start picking emails off, it's going to show you this learning module. Once you've got 10, you can then further refine from here, see, you know what? All right? This one's wrong. I don't want it on the learning and then have more data. So the moment it has 10, this refinement becomes easier for you.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  That is awesome. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  What it also does is it generates a prompt once it's trained on those 10 emails, and you can do prompt engineering as much as you want within this to make it granular, make it more sharper, or just keep it as well as you want it.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  Okay. That is great. So then when it comes to a user perspective, so if I just want to set this up, obviously you said we have like one kind of area which is training support that's really the only place that we're getting customer success card tickets in. And so what does the cost then look like for us? Is it, I don't need every user on hiver to have the auto like the gemini or sorry copilot?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  I just need it set up so that it automates these responses. So can we do that just for one email?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, so, you know, because we're a platform based solution in terms of the pricing model, once the AI add on is enabled, it has to be enabled for the whole subscription. Okay? About like 10 people total on the account. Last I checked, I'm sorry, 11 people including you. Yeah.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  11. Okay. So, and you're saying that it's 20 dollars a month?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, I mean, like for 11 people, you're effectively looking at 220 per month and the tagging is just one aspect of the AI that we do because these are customer reports. Obviously you could have sentiment as a measure of internal escalation, right? Again, prompt engineering based, you can add specific keywords, things like that, make it refined and make it better effectively. What you get to see is on every incoming email, you get to start seeing these little emojis and some of the support teams especially ours as well. What we do is if we have somebody that's like negative, very negative dissatisfied or whatever, we basically have an alert that it gets reassigned to the manager or like gets tagged a certain way. So it's reprioritized and we have an automated email going out to that customer specifically saying, hey, we're unfortunate, you know, you're not having the best of experience. We'll make that better for you. Write back to us. We'll get it checked out. And on the other hand, you know, if it's a positive, then we have a csat survey going out for us. And on your side, you can pretty much have that run anything else as well.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So my question would be, this is definitely something I'm going to propose. I need to get it approved budget wise from our team. Is there a way? I know it said we only had two days left on our.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Trial? Is.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  there a way to potentially extend that for us? One, knowing that they did not have any sort of it person in for like a year and I just started this week and is there a way to potentially add like two more weeks to that just so I can run this up the chain, get the budget to do so, and then set up all these automations so I can show them why we definitely need this.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, sure. So from a trial extension perspective that's possible at this point, we're typically only offering like a one week extension on the trial being cognizant of like the thanksgiving holidays and everything that's coming up last week. So, realistically, the longest I can probably get approval for is the 20 fifth of November, the last day, right? Yeah, that's great at about 10 days, Ish, right?

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  Perfect. Yep.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. And now that I have you just one last piece of the AI that's out and ready for you is this little part here called the ask AI. And this is by far the most highly used AI feature outside of the tagging piece, right? What this is basically a way for you to train an entire AI assistant, right? And this will be trained based on your knowledge sources. So you can either have these articles, process documents as an internal faq based on hiver, or just upload them a la carte onto the learning module for the AI. I'll send you all like help articles and everything on all of this. So you can like refer to that later. But essentially, you get to upload files, PDFS, docx, text files, everything. If you use notion, you can connect the copilot to your notion database. We're going to be launching confluence pretty soon in the next month. And next up on the list is Google drive integration as well. Essentially, once all of these data sources are fed in process documents, everything else that you need when it comes to an agent drafting a reply, this copilot would basically make that life easier. So what you can do is basically ask it to draft a reply as long as it has the right knowledge base or data sources included. It can basically give you a full complete answer including the information within those articles, within those additional information and curate a full response, right? And this becomes a little more conversational as well. So you can be like, hey, you know, refine it based on for hiver for instance, like that's some of the documents I've got, right? So it keeps getting better from there. And again, the guardrail here is you choose the data source and you choose the context for it. So it's only going to get conversational and contextual as it continues from there.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  That's super cool. Great. Sweet. Well, yeah, if you could extend the trial by a week. And then in that email that you send over, can you just include the total price? I know I have it in here. But just so I know just what that's going to cost us. And then I will run this up the chain if I want to upgrade. Can I just do that pretty simply in the platform? I don't really need to get on another call?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just drop me an email and I can have it enabled from the backend.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  Wonderful. Great. Alrighty. Thank you so much. I appreciate that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Take care. Sasha. Have a good day.

Sasha Hathway (sasha.hathaway@winningbydesign.com):
  Bye.
