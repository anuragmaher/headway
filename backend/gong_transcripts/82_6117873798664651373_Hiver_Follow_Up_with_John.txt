John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  hey, Matthew, how's it going? Hey?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  John, good. How you doing?

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  Good, good. What's up?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just wanted to follow up with you, see how it's going, see if you had any questions.

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  No, all good. We're doing a POC, I think you must have seen a bunch of new accounts got created or at least a few.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I saw you added people to your account, yes?

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  Yeah. So we're just going through the testing phase. I want them to. So like we just kicked off the testing today. They're going to be at it probably for a week or two, and then we'll make a final decision. One thing I'm probably going to need some help with not immediately, but within the next week or so is just having someone I can talk to about the API. I'll come, I'm specifically looking to pull out some metrics that we can expand from there. So, you know, like if you could line that up that'd be great. I mean, I could read through the API guide, but I'd really like, I want to short circuit the amount of effort we put into developing anything as part of that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yep got it. So, want to talk to somebody about the API?

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  Yep.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. I can help with. I can help get that scheduled for you. And then, yeah, your team's testing it out here. You think like maybe sometime next week? Is that for the API conversation? Yeah, or do you want to?

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  Wait. Yeah, that's fine. No, sometime next week is fine.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  All right. Awesome. Perfect. Yeah, I'll get that. We'll get that scheduled for you here and then just want to put a follow up on the calendar for us again? Maybe I can, do you want to do like Wednesday of next week, same time as today?

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  Can we do Monday or Tuesday?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we could do. I can't do Tuesday but I can do Monday.

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  Okay. Yeah. What time do you have? What's your free time?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Let's see it's eight o'clock… we could do the same time as today or a little bit later up to you.

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  Yeah, I think that should work for me for now. Just send the invite.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  All right. Cool. I'll do that. And then, yeah. Well, maybe I can get the API person to join that call as well.

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  Okay. Sounds good. That'd be great. All.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. I'll go ahead and extend your trial here too, and then can you remind me how many people do you think this could be for potentially?

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  I think we said 20. Okay. And I have, I think five or, yeah… I mean, it'll be probably for about 20 people, okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Sounds good. Well, thanks, John. Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

John Francis (jfrancis@securityscorecard.com):
  Sounds good. Thanks a lot. Thanks bye.
