================================================================================

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, this is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Yes. Hi, matt. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good. How are you doing?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  I'm doing well. Thanks. Thank you for meeting right now to go through this.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely appreciate you taking the time here. So the agenda for the call just want to spend the first five minutes or so getting an understanding of what you're looking for. I know you provided my colleague Preeti with some preliminary information here and then from there, I can walk you through the product and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Yeah, definitely. So I'll let you know a little bit about how our system is set up today.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  And basically we've been operating like this for a while now, we started with having one email that our clients were shared to basically go and reach out to. But it ended up being an email that started getting used for different purposes as well. So like today, we have like it's used for getting web development projects from our clients, but also to discuss existing projects as well as any billing related questions. So the same inbox is being hit for that. We currently use a Google group, Google workspace group for it. But the problem with that as you can imagine is as we're growing like who's going to be the first to respond? Maybe the person may not think it's for them to respond. So nobody responds, right? And so that's often the challenge that happens now, we are an agency service business. So if we don't respond within a few hours of getting that email, even just to acknowledge receipt, we will end up getting, we may lose the project. So some of those challenges that we have today and want to make sure there's an SLA on responses, but also making sure there's workflows assigned to making sure that the right people are getting that request on the team. So that's basically around what we're doing today. And I wanted to see like a demo of the product to see how it works, get an understanding of, you know, how it would interact with our teams. And yeah, just trying to get some information about that, that's all.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. And you're using Gmail, yes, awesome. And how many people would potentially get access to the system?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Well, today, it's today. It's you know, three people, but there's going to be potentially more, right? We haven't considered today. What happens is like, for example, we have a project manager that delegates the information to the other parties, right? But if the tool is there and there's enough features there, we'd love to be able to get that information to the right party quicker. So there could be additional two or three people that we could add potentially.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And you cut out there in the beginning, how many people was it to start?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Three? Okay, awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Yeah, sounds like. I mean hiver's definitely a great fit. I'll go ahead and show you the demo, but basically, yeah, we can create workflows. We could set up slas, so none of these responses fall through the cracks. We can make, you know, we have workflows to make sure the work gets assigned to the right person on your team. And then just, yeah, visibility into it easy to use and scalable. So, yeah… can you see my screen? Yep? Awesome. Well, we're a certified Google partner. So you simply download the hiver extension. And once you download the extension, you're going to see these icons in the upper right, and then down here on the left. So the benefit is you don't have to jump into different platforms. You get access to everything right here in your personal email. So you can answer your emails just like normal. And then you have quick access and quick notifications for when emails are coming into these, to the Google group… how it works? Is you're going to have a folder here? And these folders are going to be connected to that Google group that you have. And every time an email comes in, it's going to land in the unassigned folder here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And when you open these emails, you're going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can assign it to each other. And once you assign work to each other, you're going to get notified up here that you've been assigned this. And then also everyone's going to have a section of the folder that's called mine and this is where each person gets their individual emails that are signed to them in that folder.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'll pause it. Yeah, I'll pause there. Any questions so far?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  No, no. I was just watching how it works. So you said that I don't need to change my existing group that I have. I can use that today with the system, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. That's. Exactly what you do. You're just going to connect that group to a hiver folder. Got it. And then you share that folder with your team. And then essentially every everybody on your team can now access that group without having to log into it or anything like that?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it. Is there a way to have it track like who on the team has read those notifications?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, there's not basically with hiver, you're going to kind of move away from the whole like read and unread thing. And essentially, it's going to be more about assigning it to each other?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it. Is there any way to have like slas, where I want to track how quickly we got back to that response or like, is there a way to set up that flow?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'll get to that, of course.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it. And then the other question I had was around like just integrations with other services because we currently like our workflow is from the inbox, it usually has to go into our third party server project management tool.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Which is.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Hello, bonsai.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  So that one doesn't have any straight up like apis. So, I'm not sure if that we'd have we're currently considering like a remote server that would go in and do those updates because they don't have an MCP or anything like that. So we might just figure out a way to do it. But right now, that's the risk or the challenge right now with our team?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, unfortunately, no integration with that system.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we do have other popular project management solutions, Asana, clickup Monday. Com, but none with bonsai.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  And so the idea is it's just an integration where it would add a new entry into their platform, right? Like a ticket or whatnot, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. You could do that, with Asana, you can, with this, with our Asana integration, you could do that.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Okay. How does it kind of, is there a way for it to identify where the email needs to go to depending on the content of the message.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, there is, we can do it off of keywords. So, for instance, if you handle all the billing emails, we can set up automations in hiver that say things like if any email comes in and it mentions the following words, keywords, billing, invoice, taxes, payroll, then it's automatically going to get assigned to you.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Okay. And does it build like a knowledge? Does there a way to connect you to a, my knowledge base? So it can answer like or have any emails pre? Populated?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we have an AI co pilot which does just that it can access a, it can access your knowledge base in hiver. So hiver can build a knowledge base or it can access, yeah, it can access a URL. So, yeah, if you have a knowledge base already built, it can access it. And what it can do is it can actually draft replies for you. It's not automatic at this time. You do have to click it. And then it's going to ask you a three prompt question here… and then it will reply. So it actually learns from the emails that you've gotten. And then it can also reference a knowledge base as well.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  So, it's tracking every message that comes in. Basically, yeah, got it. There's. A lot of other tools on the market right now that offer similar service… right? Like there's a tool called, I think it starts with a G gmelius or something.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, gmelius.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  So, what, how does that, how does this differ? How does your tool, how is it better than some of the other options that are out there?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. We, you know, gmelius is a really small company, really… tiny company. Hiver's, larger over 200 employees worldwide. We offer 24 seven support directly in the chat, directly in your account, 24 seven support. And, yeah, it's easy to use. Scalable. Better support. If you look at online G2 reviews, you know, significantly more positive with hiver. Yeah, a lot more scalable. And yeah, we're constantly building and releasing new features as well.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  What AI foundation model do you guys use?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'm not 100 percent sure, but I can send it to you.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Yeah. Like I'm more curious to know like when it responds like what type of LLM is it? Oh.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's that is openai.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Oh, it is openai. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  I see and that's covered in the cost of the subscription or do we have to pay for the for like tokens and stuff like that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's an additional fee to use our AI. So we have the base subscription which is grother pro, which is either 25 dollars a user a month or 45 dollars a user a month. And then the only add on that we have is the AI subscription which is an additional 20 dollars per user per month. It's across the entire account. And it gives you access to all of our AI features that we have available now and the ones that we have coming out soon as well.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it. Okay. What if, like what qualifies as a user in the platform? Is it, is it somebody who needs to be able to get assigned the tickets? Is that, is that or the emails that's that, who qualifies as a?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  User, yeah, that's one of the use cases that qualifies and then also just anybody who would need access, like would need to, would want to log into hiver and look at everything as well. So usually it's like usually it's like the people like you mentioned, who need to get assigned work. And then also maybe some of the supervisors and executives who want to just have visibility into everything.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it. Yeah. From a pricing perspective, this ends up being more expensive though from gmelius, like, I know it's like I would say their features are similar. I did take a look at their feature set… in terms of analytics. Like are you able to, how do you set up like slas?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So yeah, basically, it's really easy to set up the slas, and then once you have them set up, it'll you can, it'll notify you like it could be, if nobody responds to this email within two hours, we want to know it's late. So this is the team view. This allows you to see all the open emails across the team. And from here, you can easily see which emails are late. You can see how late it was. You can see all the back and forwards here. But basically in the settings here, you… have an SLA section, you can create a SLA policy. And basically, it's like, okay, if nobody responds to this email within two hours, we want the following people to be notified that it's late.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And okay.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  That's fair. And then in terms of how do you set up where, like those that, if, and else the auto like delegation that you were mentioning earlier, where does that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, automations. Okay. Yeah. And we have a lot of this is another huge reason people sign up to it with us too. It's just the amount of different automations you can do in hiver is very complex. I mean, we have over 2000 customers ranging from small businesses, up to some of the largest companies in the world, companies like capital one companies like samsara. But basically, you know, we'll just say when a new conversation is received, if in the body of the email, it mentions the word invoice, taxes… payroll… right? If it has those following conditions, then we want it to automatically get assigned to Cole… and we want it to automatically add a.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  You can't send an email, I guess.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, you want to send an email to the customer?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Or to someone else on the team that's not on the, that's not a user like somebody like a contractor or something, if I wanted to send it to a contractor?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Or?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Is there like a forward email or no?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, there's not, no, you can send a reply to the person who emailed in,

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  The contacts, I, okay. But you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Can invite a contractor in on certain emails. We do have a collaborator license where that's free. You could add people to emails.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  But then I see. So they would then that, but they're just added to the email, they would still, yeah, because I have a contractor. So, how does, sorry, how does that work? Like it would, I could still just email the contractor as an action.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So if you wanted to invite a contractor into an email. So basically, what I could do, let's just say this email. I wanted a contractor to see it. I can invite them in… And basically, they would get, they would get access to this email and they would be able to reply in the notes.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  But they have to be a user in the platform?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, that would be free to do that.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Okay. So, I'm assuming they get like an email with some type of link where they have to go and go to a web interface, where they go in and respond through?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  The web exactly. Yep. Exactly.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it. Interesting. Okay. How much time does it typically take to set up the, like do the onboarding and do the configuration and do all of that. How long does it typically take?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  For a team of your size with one mailbox, maybe an hour?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, and we have 24 seven support as well. So, you know, you can always chat to somebody here. You can also set up a call with our support as well, if you're having any issues. So, we have a full help center with everything as well.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  They'll do the onboarding, right? Like they could set it up for us.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  They're not gonna set it up for you as you can imagine, you know, we don't have the resources to provide onboarding for, all of our new customers. Yep. But, but yeah, I mean, they definitely, will help you.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it. Okay. This is great. I appreciate that. So, this is awesome. I'm just trying to think if there's anything else. So what it does is it tags the email, is that what it does?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Yep. It can also tag the emails. So the tagging is great because you can categorize them. And then when you run reporting, so we have reporting, you… can select the timeframe you want to see. It could be custom, could be last 90 days. And then one of the reports that we have is the tag reports. So this could say like, okay, in the past month, you know, we got 84 emails about billing. We got, you know, 54 emails about, you know, whatever. So that's what's really helpful with the tags. It allows you to categorize them. And then also, we have user reporting which will show the workload across your team.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  What if I wanted a user on the platform that didn't need the AI features?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, unfortunately, it's across the entire account.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then also with the, I think you asked this question too with each person too. It'll also show each individual's average response times, resolution times. How long is it taking them to reply to emails? And then we also have SLA reporting which will show like, okay, how many times did you violate the first response? Slas, you can even filter these views. So, if I want to see who the people were. So, you know, Cole's the one who violated it 19 times last month… right? I can see the compliance. Is it, is it up or down from the previous month? And yeah, you can analyze this et cetera.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  What about, like if it's a lot? Like what happens often is when we deal with projects, we have a lot of back and forth that happens in those strings and they can go on for months, right? And a lot of things are hidden in the details of the back and forth. Is there a way to summarize the history of the conversation in using like, is that something that it has?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's an AI feature we have is a summarizer. So, I'm just trying to find an email here with a longer thread. I'll just do this one. But basically, there's this button up here that can summarize conversations, and then you can add it as a note.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  So, Jake submitted new.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Sorry, what is it? Where is it getting that data from?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's summarizing, like the back and forwards emails like an email thread.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  But you added it as a note? Can you, can you? Sorry? Can you show me that again? I missed how you did that. Yeah, I see. Okay. So you hit that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then it will summarize it for you.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Oh, I see. Okay. Got it. I already did that. In that. Okay. Perfect. All right. Cool. That's a cool feature. And then in terms of linking conversations, does it need us to do that manually or does it have ways to automatically identify that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You're going to need to do it manually at this time?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it. Okay. What else is there?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  In terms of workflows? Like I'm… just trying to think if this… is more for incoming mail, it's mostly to handle incoming. So, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  There are, there are automations that you can set up with when you're responding to these emails as well?

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Okay. Because I'll tell you an example of what I'm thinking like in my mind, right? Because we get a lot of development requests and what happens is today, the amount of time it takes for us to prepare a proposal, it could take up to three business days, right? Because the request comes in, we have to review it, we have to use AI to identify the details of what would be a baseline proposal, right? So, is that something that it has the ability to connect to where it can connect to like an open AI and fetch the data from an LLM as well or no?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, okay.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  But it does search all of the knowledge base that I've set up.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes. So basically, let me show you.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Okay.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Because I see it connects on your website has like connections to Google, meet Google calendar… but it doesn't connect to like a Google drive, right? But I see you can upload your own, I see.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Can you control the prompt or? No? It's just the documents that you upload.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's just the documents that you upload or the knowledge base that you have set up.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Understood. Okay. How does it know to like, how do you tell, how does it assign it depending on that? Is that, that's like, is that an option in there to auto assign it based on the content of the message?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, not at this time. No, you'd have to do an automation for that.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  So, you'd have to do an automation but it is possible you're saying?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, not really. It's not possible. Okay. Yeah.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  So, the knowledge base is whatever I'm able to provide it, but it's not like it's going to learn over time, right? With the responses and stuff like that, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, it will learn over time.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Oh, it will. Okay. All right. This is great. If I wanted to set up the demo… I didn't want to use like my personal email on it like my own main one. I wanted to use it for the group. Do I have to set it up with my personal email first? And then configure the group? Is that how it works?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's how it works. Exactly. Yep. So you download it with your personal email and then when you download it, it's going to ask you to connect the shared inbox and that's when you connect the group. So everyone's going to have their personal email here. And then you're just going to have that folder connected to the group.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Okay. And those are all different mailboxes like support healthcare, HR operations.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah, because you know, a lot of the times we're talking to larger companies here that have multiple departments with multiple email addresses that they're looking to manage. So, yeah, exactly. So it could be like finance.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  We have our own finance team as well, but I'm more focusing in on my department. So that's why it's like, I'm not really thinking about all the other groups. It's mostly like the, but that's where we're thinking we may expand this to like HR and whatnot, right? But that's why we're thinking of a platform that we can grow it with, because today, yeah, it's only three different resources, but depending on how this goes, we may add in the rest of the gang on the team, right? But we're at the moment just evaluating the product, right? And seeing which ones are better suited for our business, right? So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Absolutely. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  To add on like you guys, it's extra though, right? Like it's so it's 45 plus 20. So it'd be like 60 per user.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Got it. Okay. All right. That's great. Thank you for giving me all the information. Yeah, if I have anything else, I'll reach out and if I want to do the onboarding, what's the process for that? Do I book something or can I just do it myself?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you can just reach out to our support, you know, they're 24 seven. So yeah, any questions you have issues? You'd be able to just either sign up directly in your account or even if you started the trial, you can just, you can reach out to your support. And then, you know, during your evaluation too, I'm also here, as an additional resource.

Sulayman Khan (sulayman@clearoute.com):
  Okay. Awesome. All right. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate it. Yeah, we'll talk soon.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Thanks so much. Everyone have a good one bye.
