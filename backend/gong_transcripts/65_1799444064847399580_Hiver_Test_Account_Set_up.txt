Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hi, Anand. Thank you for joining.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Hello. How are you doing?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good. Thank you. How are you doing?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Thanks for the reminder.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries, sir. Thank you so much. I've got Manoj with me who's going to be the onboarding and implementation manager on the call today. I've given him the entire use case that we're going to be looking at sales at the rate and box management, and that would be amongst a couple of folks in the team today. We are doing so much manual tasks in outlook and we needed to have a better solution to manage the transparency visibility on these tickets, ownership on these emails, replying back to these emails and everything in a very streamlined way. And one of those easiest way to kind of manage all of these emails now, Manoj will take it up right from here. I'll be right here and we'll assist you with the setup so that you can test it for a couple of more days, weeks and then we'll look into what management to test on basis of the use cases?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Cool.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Thank you, Manoj over to you.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Thank you, Rakesh. Hi, Ronan. How are you?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Hi. Yeah, all good. Thanks.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Great. So, Ronan, let's get started with the trial. Can you please share your screen?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Share mine. Sure. Yeah, sorry… let me do that now.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. So I'm just going to walk you a few steps, you know, just trial setup, setting up your hiver account, setting up the mailboxes and I'll give you an overview.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep. Which one can you see now? Is it? This, is it? Chrome? Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, yes, great.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Great.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Now, can you go into hiverhq? Com?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, sign in or start free trial?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yep. Confirm your email address, and then… continue. And now, just email continue?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, Ronan, the link on the top app, hiverhq com is going to be your URL for the hiver interface going forward?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you can just bookmark it by the way. I mean, that's how most of my customers like it so that whenever they log in into hiver, they know this is a login page.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep. Sounds good. Thank.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  You, now, do I sign in with Microsoft?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Your email address?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yep. Check?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Should I just pop this in?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, follow the details?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  I think vakesh already has your number, but it's just, you know, for the sales team purpose, we need records.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep. Should that, should that be my mobile?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Anything? Yeah, that would be good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you. Yeah, mobile should do.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Cool. Shall I, is it just, yeah, cool.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Continue now, the shad mailbox Ronan. So, what kind of mailbox do you currently have? The sales mailbox?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yes, what I might do for this… we have two domains, okay? And I might use the other one for this for now because I have all the admin privileges to that one. Okay? So, I'm going to go ahead and put that one in, if that's all right… which is a, is this?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Domain, you know, like altogether a separate office, 365 account or is it linked to your, is it linked to like a primary and a secondary domain?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  I think it is an altogether separate one. So, shall I use the other one? Okay? I can do that. I'll just do that. I just, I'm unsure whether.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  What kind of mailbox it is?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  I think it is actually a user account, this one.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  If it's a user account, Ronan, we would need the password for it.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  That's fine. I can get the, I can get the password that's no problem.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Then you can click on continue.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Go ahead on that.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Authorize.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Right. Just one sec. Yeah, sure. Let me just check where that is.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sorry, just one second apologies.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No worries. No problem. Please take it.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Okay. So… okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  I think they've blocked this account from accessing by third party tools.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Maybe. Okay. So, we just need to change that on the on.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  The office 365 console. Yeah.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sure. Okie. Dokes, probably can just… okay. Cool. One second on that.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, sure.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Right. So, it looks like I've updated that account now to, okay?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  As in my account is now an admin. So I'm just going to start that again if that's all right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Can you just directly go into app? Hiverhq? Com. You don't have to do a start feature? Okay?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah. Oh, as in the one that I bookmarked? I guess. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes. Yeah, because since you have already signed it, it's just a mailbox step. That is, you know, pending.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sure. Makes sense. Bookmark where's it gone?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  So, it's.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  logging you into the account?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  There we are, so.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thanks.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Maybe I'll just need to.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, Ronan, the code is being sent to your account?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yes. Okay. Well, it looks like it, yeah, as in, I was just going to try and look at the… unfortunately, I don't have access to my authenticator. I don't know where it is.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  I may know why it's going to your account.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Well, on this, it was just so that… it looks like a admin needs to.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No. So, the thing is it basically needs, it's like whitelisting hiver, right? I see. Yeah, it's nothing related to two factor or, you know, you being an admin, it's just that I think the Microsoft admin has blocked any third party applications from accessing the sales email. Okay?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  I see. Yeah, I just don't know how to turn that off.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Because I think we need to whitelist hiver in that account.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah, understood.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. Ronan, let's do one thing. You mentioned that you do have access to the other domain account, right? Okay. Yeah, let's try that. Yeah, can we try that?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah, sure. So, I'll just go.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can close that, sign in to your account. Just go into app hiverescue. Com. Yeah. Huh.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Try setting up the other one. Let's see if that has access. Maybe, you know, you can do the testing on that. And then when we go forward by that time, we can have this account sorted. Yeah. Okay. So, this is a shared mailbox.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  That's right? It's a proper shared mailbox, this one.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Okay. That's about it.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  I think it's going to get an error. Yeah, because you're logged into another domain, the trial setup was done using your hardwoodsgroup, com, right?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, only, if your hardwoodsgroup com is part of the other domain's, shared mailbox. You'll be able to authenticate?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Understood. So, I guess… if I.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  that's fine. Yeah, the best way and the easiest way is, you know, someone from your it team allowing third party access for the sales email address.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Because otherwise, the alternatives are you switching email accounts and domains constantly and changing a couple of things in office, which I wouldn't recommend because these are two separate domains and you don't want them to get mixed up in outlook?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, we need to be using this one, but we just need to make sure that.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah, OK.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Fine. Okay. One second, then I'll just, I'll see if I can get that sorted now.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Right? So.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Okay. So now we have access to the admin for the hardwoods group. So if I do… that and then.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  and now I can do this.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  right. I think we're finally there.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Oh, okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No, no, just do retry sign in. Okay. Yeah. Make sure the password is right? And then do a sign in again.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sure.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. There we go. Cool. Because previously, what happened is the two factor again went back to your email address for the sign in. Because you would have been logged out from hiver as well since you updated your settings.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah, understood.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, Yeah. Now, next step inviting your team members, Ronan, Should we do that right now or I can tell you where, yeah.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  May as well?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, sure.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  So, just going back to the point about the other domain, Is, will we be able to connect that at all? Would we need a new like… hiver account essentially, or could you connect the domains?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So Ronan here's the thing, right? You will be able to set it up as a mailbox, But when you're going to authenticate the mailbox, it must be someone who's part of it. So, I presume.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Since, understood. Yeah, that makes sense.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you need to add a user who's part of that shared mailbox basically with that domain, In hiver. And then if he or she has access to the mailbox, then they can set it up as a shared mailbox and then continue from there.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Right. So, if I do let's try that, then maybe now, Would that work? If I invite this? Is that what you were saying? Invite this Guy, which is me, but with my other domain as a team member?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can check that. Will that work? We can check that?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Do we need to add them all in now or can I just?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  You can do that later as well? You can just click on finish setup at the bottom.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Perfect. Now, the trial setup is complete, you have the sales hardwoods mailbox on the left?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep. It's got a pop up? Yep.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yep. Now that's done now, on the left hand side, do you see a settings, the gear icon?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Can you go into that admin panel? So this is where you'll be having your major controls like setting up mailboxes, adding users, removing users, your knowledge base and everything? Sure. And the advanced settings. So on the left, can you click on users? Yes… the third option?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, Ronan, make… your other email address as an admin?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  That's done. Now, open a new tab, sorry, not a new tab, open a new Chrome profile.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Just click on your initials on the top, right? Yeah, add a profile.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. And in the new profile, log in using the other email address, your email address, that is Ronan at best.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  I don't think I have a Google account with this at present. Shall I create one?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No, no, no, no worries. No worries. Just go back then. Just go back, continue without an account because anyways, it's an outlook account, right? Sure. Yeah, yeah, we don't need to sign in.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Let's just do.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Cool. And then,

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  yeah. Now, go to, just go to app, hiverhq. Com, directly because you're already invited, right? Yep. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Sign in with Microsoft, use the other email address?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  You can stop chatting for a moment if you want to see the,

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  password, yeah, I'll just move on to another window. Okay? Remembering.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Passwords are pretty tough. Yeah.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Especially when they're the, the Microsoft automated ones and they're just like.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  letters and numbers. Yeah, they're complicated.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah, that's for sure. But they are secure. So…

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  so, yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Sorry, I was on mute, perfect. No worries. Now. Yeah. Now, go back into the admin panel, and let's try creating the other mailbox as well. Cool. So, so you're gonna receive, customer facing emails in both of these mailboxes.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Correct.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. And you have different set of people working out of these mailboxes there?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Is some, there is some crossover, okay. But, yeah, there… they all have separate email addresses, for both if needed.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, understood? Okay. No worries. Yeah, let's go ahead with the, say support. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  There's element permissions?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Oops.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Okay. I've definitely got admin privileges on that one.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Maybe it's for like whenever you're creating the shared mailbox, there are a set of permissions that, you know, you being able to log in using that or you being able to.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah, I see.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Maybe I could or maybe is… it definitely a shared?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah, it is definitely a shared mailbox.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Can you open that and see the permissions? Okay. I hit glow, yeah, go into delegation. Nobody asked like, just to let you know, the send us permissions and, yeah, the managed mailbox, delegation should be present.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep. Got you. Sorry, I need to.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Can I go back and also the send us, should I do?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  This one as well?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, because you should be able to send emails using the support at email address, right?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Ah, okay. So, these all need to, yeah?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Because you don't want your personal emails to be crowded with customer emails, sure.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Cool. Can you just click on it again? I just want to double check if everything else is done. Okay. Click on mailbox… yeah, mailbox… delivery. There's. No restriction. Okay. Yeah. Can you go back to other like, yeah, others. So, you're part of the thing that is fine. Can you click on send on behalf on the top? I see hide mailbox email forwarding send on behalf.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Can you just for now add your name alone?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can go back, oops.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Anything else you wanted to look at on that?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Nothing for now? Yeah, nothing for now. This should work Ronan.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Let's go back to the,

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  you may not have updated it.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Does take some time.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  So, this one, this one here, should that be all of them as well? All the other people?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  The reduxes?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yes… full access… but surely they can read the messages without being ticked on this.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, they can read the messages right now, right? Yeah.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  So, we don't actually.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Need to add something. Yeah, you don't have to do that right now.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  This is only for essentially being like a bit of an admin almost, you can, yeah. Okay. Yep. Right. Let's maybe let's have a look whilst that loads. If we just have a look in the… yeah, okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let's just close the other window. Ronan, let's stick to this window and let's do the sign up from here. Okay. Now, go into shad inboxes. The first option. Yep. Okay. Click on create email box on the top, right?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sorry, just, oh, here. Yeah. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Now, you type in the support ad?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Ah, do it from, yeah. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Select outlook shad mailbox, continue, let's authorize?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Like, yeah, this one?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, yes. Because giving the hardwoods group will not work since it's not part of the shad mailbox.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Understood.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. I'll so Ronan, let's hold on to this for a while, right? Huh. Let's continue testing with the sales ad, right? Yeah. Let me also check on the backend if then some other setting needs to be done since it's a different domain. Sure. Right. Yeah, because as far as I can see, like outlook or office three six five usually takes like, it says five minutes, but it takes around like 15, 20 minutes whenever you change the setting.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sure. Yeah, that makes sense.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Maybe you can try it after like 30 minutes or so, and if you're still getting an error, just email us. Yeah, and in the meantime, I will check with my product team and see if anything else has to be done.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Understood. Okay. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Apart from that, your account is ready and you can start testing.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Cool. Okay. So, we've got this one. Will the personal inboxes, will they come in here as well for each person?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  If you connect them, yeah, right now, it's just a shared mailbox which is connected. Yep. Excuse me, all new emails into your unassigned and, you know, on the right hand side, you have your activity panel where you make the assignment status tags.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Right. Once you assign an email to yourself, it goes into your mind folder and rest of the team can see it in the team folder.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And when you click on all views right below tags… yeah, you have the pending and the closed section which relates to the status. So we have three default status, open pending and closed.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Right. The mine unassigned and the team section will have the open emails pending will have pending and the closed will have closed.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, you can create custom views based on assignment status and tags. Okay. You see the small plus symbol right next to all views? Yep. Yeah. Click on the plus. You have the filter option, use the filters to create your own custom view.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sure. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Cool. Yeah. Can we go back? Like just go back from conversations? Yeah, anything… tags, you see the tags option right below team. So tags is ideally your folders. Again, outlook, you might have folders categorizing the emails. Similarly, you can have folders here, which will be visible to everybody in the team. Yeah. So you can just… use the folders to categorize the emails. But in hiver, you have the way for automation like based on customer domains, a subject line, body of the email, any keywords, you pick it up, set up the automation to add the tag, and you can also use the automation to send… notification, assign to a person, add a tag update status and lots more. Okay. And everything, every advanced setting is there under the admin panel?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah, that makes sense. So tags would be, I guess generally, they'd be like the type of email, like how it's dealt with sort of thing?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So how we normally use it is like for a sales use case, we have tags such as new customer, right? And then we will have something based on invoices, and then something based on inquiries. Yeah, all of these can be your tags, you know, because you might get several different sales issues or several sales feedback as well, right? So all of these types of emails, you just list them down as tags. So it's easier for you guys to track it.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Understood. So generally speaking, Yeah. So generally they would be manually assigned, but you can also create the automations.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I would say that, you know, first you start manually assigning these tags so that, you know, for which emails these tags are going to be placed. And from those emails, we can pick up those identificators. Like is it the email address or is it a keyword from the subject? Or the body? And based on that, we can set up the automation.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sure. Yeah. Okay. Just going on to the, let me go on this. So the, what's it called the status?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yep.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  So, am I right in thinking you can do, did… you say you can do custom bespoke statuses? We cannot.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  We cannot customize in the default statuses, but we do have something called custom fields, okay? Where you can have a separate drop down of your custom status, maybe like, you know, you have a priority level or work in progress? Something like that?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  What I wanted to show you was get your feedback on this. We use Hubspot. Okay? As our CRM. Okay. Now, if I just go on to, I don't… know, I don't know if you're familiar with Hubspot.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we use Hubspot as well, Ronan. Okay.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Oh, you do? Yeah, cool. That's useful. So, we have, I should go on deals. And basically, we have multiple deal stages in the pipeline. Okay?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I understand.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  And I was wondering whether you could, well, obviously, you could create a custom field for the pipeline stage. I assume if it was an inquiry?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yep. You can. Yeah.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Because what I'm thinking is, we have like the design team as well as the sales team. So if they can, if they can also be shared to this inbox, they would be able to see the communication and would… also be able to see what stage the email's up to. So, this is basically the pipeline how we run.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  It understood. So it requires, qualification, follow ups. All of these, you want to have them as additional statuses?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah. Would that be possible or a custom field would be fine?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, custom field. So, custom field, you have four kinds of custom fields Ronan a text number, dropdown and a date?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Okay. So dropdown will work.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you have a dropdown, you list everything and you can just select based on the conversation… yep.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Cool. And then I was, also, do you, is there any integration between helpscout? And like automatic between helpscout and hiver?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Automatic, we do have an integration with helpscout. So when an email comes in, if the email address is present as a contact or a deal in helpscout, we'll be able to pull up the details and, you know, make it visible on the hiver, right? Panel. So if you switch to hiver, let me just quickly show you.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  On the top, right? On the right hand side, on the top, do you see a small symbol? Yes, click on it? Yeah. So this is basically going to be your apps page. Sure.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Right. And you have an integration with helpscout? Let's just see if it should pop up. Yeah, there you go. Helpscout. So all of these details will be visible. These are basically going to be your details card, contact custom field deal for custom?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Cool. Yeah, that's useful.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Okay. So that's.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  yeah, select the inbox… save and enable… done.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Cool. Right. So, let's go back to here. So, oh, just one more question. Whilst I think of it, the past emails, do they sync across?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  The older emails? Yes. Okay. We need to check with the Rakesh. We do have the import right now, right? For the.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It is indeed not possible within the test period, Ronan, because you'd have to include our engineering team to kind of look at the older emails and import that in hiver, which definitely includes significant amount of, you know, some engineering work. But once you say, hey, we like hiver and we want to move forward with it, we can absolutely look at how many number of emails that we require. And then we can sync all of those and put that into the closed bucket for you. So that's called import process, which is absolutely doable.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Got you. Cool. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then from here itself, you've got a support system. I mean, should you have any more questions with regards to the setup, you can always go ahead and chat with our support team right? From here. I mean, where you log in right there on the top, you have our technical support available. And then in case you want to self help yourself, this is a knowledge base. So you can even go ahead and, you know, look at the help center, look at different automation workflow, and all of that. Now, in the interest of time, what I would love to do is maybe set up another meeting towards the mid of next week to go through the progress and of course, take care of any questions. And in the meanwhile, you can also add a couple of more users to your test account.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yep. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, great. Let's do that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. I'm looking into the diary for next week, if you could help me with maybe a call on Wednesday, the twelfth that should give you sufficient time?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  That, yeah, that should be, oh, Wednesday's always a little bit busy for me. Okay? Would, oh, actually, no, might be fine.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I can do slightly earlier if you want or.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  No. Let's say that 12 o'clock on Wednesday that'll do. Yeah, I am free then, so.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Give me one minute. Let me quickly check that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. We can do 12 and I'll call it hiver sync. I'm going to be inviting you and should you need to invite anybody else from your team after they're also invited to the test account and they've got more questions. Feel free to bring them into the meeting?

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Also just adding Manoj to be on the safer side if we have any more technical questions. But yeah, in the meanwhile, Manoj is also going to be checking about the second shared mailbox setup and the challenges that we did around with it. So we'll keep you posted about that one.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah, I'll have a little look and if I can get it sorted if it's just the time thing, then that's fine. Hopefully that's the case, no worries.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. And there should be an invite already out in your calendar for next week, if you could check that you'll get it.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Perfect. Yeah, I'll review that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sometimes it does take maybe one or two extra minutes, but it should be right there.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Sure.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Yeah, got it. Yep.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Perfect. Except.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  Sorted.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Thank you so much again, and we look forward to talking to you next week. Enjoy the rest of your day. Have a good weekend. Thank.

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
  You and yourself. Yeah. Take care. All right. See you. Bye, bye bye.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):

Ronan Ltd (ronan@hardwoodsgroup.com):
