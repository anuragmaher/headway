What got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  can introduce myself first. So, my name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the email management and client experience space now for a little over six years now. And yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can help you all today. Yeah, perfect. And then I'll kick it.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Over to you. Yeah. So I'm leaky johnson. Yeah, sure. Perfect. Yeah. So, Cole, I'm leaky johnson. Yeah, the it manager and in charge of system implementation here in armor texasins. Yeah. So the reason for the call today is simply some of in armor texasins insurance. Yeah, we manage customer inquiries, claims, follow ups and also agent support requests and billing questions primarily through shared inboxes. Yeah, like the support at the claims and billing… two of the key problems we are having. And the reason I'm trying to record for you guys is one we've got unstructured email landing.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, don't you know me.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you're breaking up. You're coming in and out.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Okay. Let me check on the connection of the internet then.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, can you hear me… hello?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Hello? Yes, Cole. Can you hear me?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Can you hear me?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, I can hear you now.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. You were saying you were explaining why you booked a call today? Like some of the challenges you're looking to solve for?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah. So I was sharing some of the issues we are facing to you.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, like one, we've got unstructured email handling whereby… multiple team members reply independently or duplicate efforts where it leads to confusion and also slower response times. Yeah, we also lack visibility or SLA tracking. There is no easy way to see which emails are pending. Yeah, who owns them and how long they have been waiting. Yeah. And this leads to.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, Lee, can you hear me?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, I can hear you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, you, were, you broke up again?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Oh, sorry. Sorry. So as I said, Cole… we have manual workflows and fall ups and also poor reporting and analytics. Yeah. So those are some of the issues we are facing and we would like you guys to solve the problems with us. Yeah, simply and also, there is no clear assignment or escalation, that is, we miss opportunities because emails may be ignored and take too long for attention. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So you're looking for better email management, right? So, how many shared inboxes or emails are you managing today?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Okay. We got… more than 101 100 to 500.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And that's shared inboxes?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  No, no, that's not shared inboxes. It's all the general.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's just general emails.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How many different email addresses or shared inboxes? Are you managing at? You know, Texas insurance?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Okay. Sure. So, the shared is five. Yeah, five to 10 shared inboxes typically including the support, the claims, the billing, the agents, and also the info, and also the compliance. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And that's you're looking to manage all those within hiver.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And are you using Gmail or outlook today?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, we are using Gmail outlook.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You're using Gmail today?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, we are using the, yeah, the outlook. Yeah, too.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, you're using outlook today? Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Awesome. So, I think, you know, this is some good information for me to, you know, run off today to give you a demonstration of hiver. So let me just share my screen and I can show you how we can help you better manage those, you know, shared inboxes. And how we can, you know, streamline those assignments amongst your team. Okay? One second here?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, taking a look at my screen here, leakey, and you can see my screen, right?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, I can see your screen. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. What's nice about hiver, right? We created a very, you know, simple yet effective and powerful email management tool. So we're going to help you better manage those shared inboxes, helping with that delegation, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks. Things are getting assigned to team members with clear ownership. We're tracking those slas as well as those statuses to ensure that nothing slips through the cracks. So taking a look at my screen here, what's nice about hiver is you'll be able to sign in with your Microsoft sso, and once you do, you'll have access to this hiver application that we're looking at, where we'll be able to manage our personal email communications up top, and then our shared communications within outlook below. So taking a look at the support shared mailbox, right? I'll click into this one. For this example, as I click into the support shared mailbox, it's going to open up some subviews beneath it that's going to help us manage the intake of communications. The first is mine, everything that's been assigned to me. The next is the unassigned section, new emails that have the mailbox that need to be distributed via automation or manual assignment. And then there's the team view, right? Understanding what is everyone on the team working on in real time? What's outstanding and what needs to be completed across this group that is supporting that's customer support, shared mailbox… want to pause here, leakey. Any questions so far?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Wow, that's so nice. Actually, you're explaining very well and everything is very simple and flexible to understand. I think the solution is one of the best, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. So going to the unassigned section, right? I'm going to click into this and it's going to open up. Actually, I'll go to a different email here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Let's see, actually let me go to sales. So going into this, you know, conversation, right? We're going to have the ability to track some statuses and different things around the conversation when it comes in. So the first thing we can do is actually let me find like a better, these… are all like not great emails. Let's see. Okay, this is better. So clicking into this email, right? Once we're in it, we have a couple different options around the email. The first is assigning it, choosing which team member is going to own it and follow up with that communication. In this case, I've selected myself which then sets it to the mind section that's the first way we can assign work. The next way we can assign work is a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the emails as they come in. And then the next way is skill based routing. So identifying keywords in the subject line, identifying keywords in the body of text, and then sending it to that specific person that has that specific skillset. How ideally leaky, would you want to assign the work in your world? Like how are you assigning work today? And how do you want to assign it in the future?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Okay. Currently, we assign, yeah, we assign the work, yeah, via also the manually and also via the emails. Yeah. But if we can have an automated or a centralized way of assigning, we'll be in a good position.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep, 100 percent that's something we can do. So we can automate it where it's like, you know, maybe an email comes in and there's the keyword claims, right? In the body of text, we've identified the keyword claims. We're always going to send that conversation to let's say to Cole myself because I handle claim inquiries. And then once it's sent to me, right? We can track the status whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks when working through these conversations to a resolution, adding those tags for organizational purposes. These tags are really helpful in a couple different ways. The first is to understand what the conversation is about and organizing these conversations in buckets folders or views, right? We can also use these tags for the analytics section on the backend to understand why people are reaching out, you know, what are the hot topics we're seeing and trends across that mailbox? And then the last couple of things here, right? Is the notes section. So being able to collaborate internally. So I'm going to send this notification to matt… he'll, receive a notification, top left right here. He'll then be able to click on it. It'll take him right to this thread where we can keep having this back and forth conversation… once we decide, you know, how we want to respond. Let's say we need more information. I'm going to use our AI codepilot to generate a response. This is going to help us streamline sending… a response by leveraging the data that we feed it so it can search through information like PDFS, website, links, word, docs to streamline responses. So I've then been able to draft this response. I can insert it into the draft. And then if I'm done, right, I can then send and close this conversation, changing that status from open to closed. And then we're moving on to the next email communication. Want to pause here, leakey. What are your thoughts on this so far?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, good. Actually, this is something I have liked. Yeah, and I think we'll be moving forward with it since we need this, yeah, as soon as possible.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many people would be working out of hiver, like how many people are managing the emails?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Actually, we'd like maybe 10 people to manage those emails. So, yeah, five.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Like 10 people?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, six to 10 people.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Six to 10 people got it. And then in terms of analytics leaky, we also have some great insights. I know you mentioned you want to understand more about that. Do you have any analytics you'd be looking for specifically? Yeah.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Actually, yeah, the analytics we'll be looking as I shared earlier is like the building… dashboards for volumes response times and team performance.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. So here we can see things like active new resolved conversations, you know, overall workload across that support share mailbox. Yeah, you know, we can also see things like performance metrics, like what our average first response time was as a group, our… average resolution time as a team, individual user metrics. Leaky. So emails assigned, per user, emails sent out per user, and then their individual performance metrics, like what was Cole's average first response time over this time period? And what was my average resolution time… tag metrics? So understanding why are people reaching out? What are the hot topics we're seeing amongst the team? Based on active new resolved conversations? We can see the workload breakdown below. So, you know, how many conversation types we're getting across those tags and then the performance, and how long it's taking us to handle those each and individual requests. Okay? And then there's SLA analytics. I know you mentioned you want to be able to track your first response times and resolution times. These SLA analytics will show us how many times you violated those first response or resolution time goals over a time period, and how many times we were also in compliance as a team just to see how we're tracking against our slas. Any more questions on the analytics leaky?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah. Actually, as I have understood everything on there. Yeah, the analytics is well clear and shown. Yeah. Okay. And we'll be able to, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. And then going to the back end, right? We'll go to the support share mailbox. So here's where we can manage each individual share mailbox. So we have the different mailboxes, right? Finance, human resources, operations, sales support, and all the different emails ids associated with them. And you can click on them to manage them individually and manage who has access to them. So the members you can see, communicate, assign and send messages within that share mailbox, you know, having that round Robin auto assignment that will equally distribute the conversations amongst the team… we can create automations where it's like, you know, new conversation comes inbound to the mailbox, we've identified the subject line and in the body of text that there's these keywords, trial new sign up and login. Since we've identified this is a new customer reaching out. We're going to add the tag new customer and then send this customized reply. But we could also take this further by maybe assigning this to someone specifically. I'll sign this to Cole. You know, maybe I'll send a notification to leadership letting them know that this new customer just signed up.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then I know you mentioned slas, so tracking those slas and first response times and resolution times.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So let's say, you know, a billing request came in. One of our automations applied the tag billing to it, right? Since that automation applied that tag billing, it's then going to trigger off this SLA, where we're going to have a first response goal of one hour and a resolution goal of 24 hours to this billing request. So every billing request that comes in and gets automatically tagged will have these goals. And if we can't hit them, you can choose who to notify to let them know that this slipped between the cracks. And this will also all go against the analytics that we're tracking. What are your thoughts on this SLA? Leaky?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, actually, yeah, this SLA will be a good way because as I told you that, in terms… of the visibility and SLA tracking, yeah, it will ensure that there is no hard time to measure response times. Yeah. Yep.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep, 100 percent. Yeah. But that's pretty much the main things I wanted to cover today. Leaky. Then in terms of pricing, I… would have you between the pro or the elite plan. So the pro gives you up to five share mailboxes, 20 rule based automations. It gives you AI agents copilot additional analytics. And then the elite will give you unlimited share mailboxes, unlimited automations and everything that's included in this plan down here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, I would have you either between the pro or the elite.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Wow, these are good plans. Yeah, actually, yeah, actually the 65 pro most popular. It's it's… good. If.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  you need, if you need all 10 share mailboxes, I would recommend the elite. If you just need five share mailboxes, you could get away with the pro?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, yeah, sure. Actually this pro is.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good. So, just want to understand further leaky as well. Like when are you looking to be up and running with a solution? And what makes sense for next steps from here? Typically for us, we do offer a free trial for you to test this. So if you did want to test hiver, we can set you up for a trial for 10 days. What are your thoughts on that?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah. Actually, as I told you, we want to move forward with this solution and I think it's a good position to move forward in the next year steps like maybe the onboarding… and also other processes. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you want to move forward with the solution?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, actually because we are now ready to get a solution since this year started. Yeah, actually, we want to move forward.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, do you know which plan you want to move forward with? We can touch base on this again.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah. Actually, the pro is within our budget.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And that's for five shared mailboxes?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah… because.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The pro allows up to five mailboxes, just want to confirm that's okay.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Awesome. And who will be signing off on the contract? So typical next steps from here, once you sign off leaky, I will introduce you to a customer success manager for implementation and team training, who will be the one signing off on the contract?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, sure. Actually, I'm the decision maker and will be the one who will be signing off the contract.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So, should I send you over a proposal for 10 users on our pro plan after this? So it would be 650 dollars a month or for an annual basis, just to give you the annual? It would be?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, that will work. Yeah?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It'd be 7,800 annually.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. And it would at the same time work for you to borrow to touch base for a kickoff call?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, sure. Actually, we will be in a good position, yeah, to move forward. Yeah. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Tomorrow, we're tomorrow January sixth, same time, nine a. M. Esc works for you for a kickoff call?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah. Then, because I will be aware, I will be already finished the internal consultation, then we'll be in a good position to move forward.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. So I just sent you an invite for tomorrow. Did you see that on your end?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah. Let me check.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, sure. Sure.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. That works for you that time that I said?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah, it works for me.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. So, what I'll do after this leaky. So, will you be signing off and I can send you the contract right now if you have time to do it over the call?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Would you want me to send you the contract right here while we're on the call to execute the partnership?

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Yeah. You can send, you can send.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Give me like one or two minutes and I'll send it over here for us to review.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Okay. No problem. One.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Second here. Leaky. I'm just going to create the contract, and then I'll just hold on the line. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Actually, let me create it right after this leaky. I'll send it over to you via email for signature, and then we can go from there.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Okay. Sure. And then maybe I called there was also an inquiry.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  Hello call.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. What'd you say? Yeah.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  There was an inquiry. Oh, also, I had forgotten also, there was also a mention of a gift card after the call. I don't know how to.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Go about. it. Got it. So our marketing team will send that to you right after this. Okay? I'll.

Leakey Johnson (leakeyjohnson@armor-texasins.com):
  appreciate it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, no, thank you so much. Leaky. It was great to connect with you and I'll send over the contract for signature right after this?
