Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Hi, Ashley. Good morning.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Hey, good morning. How are you guys today?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  I am doing well. How are you?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Yeah, fine. Thanks for asking.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. I believe it's just you two from the foxcarriers side, correct?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Yeah, right.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Well, we can go ahead and get started. I'm going to share my screen and then I'd like to do a quick round of intros as well. So, my name is Eric Lafon. I am your customer success manager here at hiver, been with the company a little bit more than a year. I've been in the software space for about a decade. I actually came from somewhat related space to you all, I don't know if you're familiar with lytics drivecam. I worked there for about three years. So, I've worked with a lot of similar companies in my past. Obviously, I'm here to help you onboard. But the way I view my role is I'm here to ensure that your organization is getting the most value out of your investment in hiver. So really understanding your business goals objectives and helping you get there, that's how I view my role. I am joined here by my colleague. Raghav. We both support your account Raghav, if you want to come off me and introduce yourself.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. Yeah. Thanks for that. Eric. Hey, Sasha. Hey, Ashley, pleasure. Meeting both of you. I'm Raghav, as Eric's mentioned, I lead our account management motion here at hiver. I've been with the hiver business for about eight years now working across almost all of the customer facing roles. We've got been an operator in the space for a decade, and yeah, I'm going to be an added resource to Eric who's going to be a primary point of contact in the initial days. He's going to be helping you with the setup onboarding and everything. And I will be stepping in more from a growth commercial perspective down the line. Pleasure meeting both of you. Excited to kick you all off.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Sounds great. Guys. Nice to meet you. Yeah, let's go ahead.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah, if you don't mind, I have some notes but I'd love to get a quick intro from each of you and just a little bit about your role specifically.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  All right. Yeah, great. Let me introduce myself. My name is Ashley. I am the manager of the customer support department of foxcarriers. The main role of our department is to support the driver and the customer while the load is in transit. So we are using hiver to communicate with our customer primarily because like our workflow with a load is mainly in Gmail. So we use a lot of… yeah, we're using Gmail a lot during the day because we notice our customer about every action with the load. Once our driver on his way to pick up location, once he picked up the load, we updated them with all information about the condition of the load. And during the trip, we keep their posts with drivers driving or stop rest and et cetera. We are in touch with the customer until the load is delivered successfully and sometimes even further until we get paid from this customer. Yeah. And also on this meeting with us is, Sasha is my deputy, Sasha, do you want to introduce yourself?

Sasha Davis (sasha.davis@foxcarriers.com):
  So, yeah, thank you, Ashley. My name is Sasha. I'm the deputy of Ashley and yeah, I'm also like involved in customer support service of our.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  company.

Sasha Davis (sasha.davis@foxcarriers.com):
  So, we are working with loads and facing some issues with our mailing system. So hope your system… will help us to grow in our service.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Great. Well, that's appreciate the introductions, helpful additional context. Again today is a bit high level. I really want to set the tone and understand the way that you want to get set up. The way that we look at this is, it's going to be a series of calls, not too many, but really what I will be doing with both of you is on the next call, diving deep into your workflows. So, Ashley, you mentioned things like your dispatchers, and you're constantly updating throughout the lifecycle of the delivery, right? So I'm going to want to understand how those emails initiate, how they start, what other systems you're communicating with, right? The whole lifecycle of what your agents, you know, what their day looks like, how they're interacting that'll allow me to prescribe the most efficient way for your team to be set up right there's. Certain features that maybe will make more sense or not based on what you want to achieve and the way that your team operates. So typically I can do these depending on the complexity of your workflows. Probably in about two calls, I would say is a good target to shoot for in terms of setup. And then, Ashley, I think we mentioned in a past email, part of this will also include training the team so I can walk through a whole training of how they operate in hiver, in their day to day. Now, in terms of timeline, I can move as fast or as slow as you want. So, Ashley, it sounds like maybe the team has already started to use it a little bit. From your perspective. Do you have a date in mind that we want to be live by a certain date?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  No, I can't name you the date, but I think we need to go slow because our workflow is a really complicated question. We don't have the full CRM system right now. So our workflow is mainly in a spreadsheet and it's really hard to integrate. And right now we develop in our company, we develop in our department and not only like with hiver, but we also build in our own CRM system. And our workflow looks the one way right now. But I'm pretty sure we would have some changes because we are waiting for the CRM system and our workflow going to be different, I hope from the January of next year. And yes, there is a big question about the integration between hiver and our CRM system. Could you please just tell me a bit? Do we have some opportunities to integrate both of them? For example, for now, our workflow looks like we have two different kinds of email chain for one load. The first email our team received from another department, it's like internal email only for foxcarriers. We received this email from the dispatcher, he informed us about the new load he has for us to support and the information about what we are picking up, et cetera. And after that, the support manager initiated the email track with the customer, the external one that is for now. But I hope from January, we're going to have our CRM system and the dispatcher will… like they won't, send us the email with the new load. It's all going to be in a CRM system. They would create the form for the load. And we want somehow to integrate the CRM system. For example, it's going to show which agent is assigned to the specific load. And we want hiver to understand, maybe to understand it. I don't know. It's just my fantasy for now how we can do it, but like to check who is assigned to this load and assign the same person to the email for this load.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yep. So on that note, so just to address kind of the timeline perspective, it sounds like you want to start a little bit on the slower side. We can get the foundational pieces and we can get the team up in hiver in the next few weeks just with the knowledge knowing that your own processes might slightly change once you do implement this CRM that's no problem. It sounds like it would just be some, maybe some minor tweaks to that… right now in the us, I'm just looking at my calendar because we are approaching thanksgiving. Do you want your team up and running in hiver before thanksgiving, which would be about two weeks away?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  The thing is our team is really, it's really big. It's about 80 people right now and we and this whole team divided to sub teams. So, and one of our sub teams is already using hiver and I am thinking about adding the team one by one. So, and I am on my way and I hope to add another team by the end of November. So I would like to have the call with training… let's say before thanksgiving to make sure all my team leaders are familiar with hiver, how to use it and they can train their team, so we can make this integration like really smooth team by team.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. That sounds like a good target. So we can aim for that. Gives us almost two weeks which is plenty of time to roll this out to those one or two teams. Question on that front, is you mentioned there's sub teams, does each sub team operate out of a different mailbox or is everyone still operating out of a general support? Or just different teams are grabbing the work based on maybe certain criteria?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  All right. So we have one team inbox. All of the team members have an access to this inbox. But for now, the biggest part of my team don't use the team inbox on their daily routine. They're using their own like email. We just add in like all the direct email of the team in their chain so they can work from their direct emails, but also they have the access to our like main inbox. If something missing, they… were forgetting to add it to the chain. They can add them by themselves. So, yeah. And my goal is to make all of these, all of the team work from only one email, only one group email using hiver.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. That makes sense. Yeah, I was wondering how the different teams, if you were rolling them in slowly by slowly, it sounds like a lot of them still operate out of their own individual. So that gives me some good context. Okay? That's perfect. The other thing just to address, we can dive into this as I work through your use case in the next call, from a CRM perspective, we'll have to understand what's going on there. So just in general, from integration standpoint, we do have integrations with, you know, the most popular and well used CRMS, Salesforce and Hubspot, just to confirm your CRM is going to be home built. Is that correct?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Yeah, it's our own product.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. So that's something that we'll have to discuss in the coming months. As of right now, we don't have a direct way to integrate with that. With that being said, this is definitely something we can explore in the future. I think for now, right? We want to get you set up with these one or two teams, understanding the right way to set you up the right way to assign. And I'm going to leave a note here that this is something we can explore as we continue to evolve.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  All right. Yeah. Let me tell you a little bit about how we operate right now. So as I mentioned, we have this our main team inbox. But for this period of adaptation for integration, the team, one by one, I created another inbox just for hiver. And after all, the team is familiar with hiver, we're going to delete this. Let's say test Gmail address and be like you and started to use our main operations team email address. And for now, yeah, we have this second email address for a team inbox. And we have not like the round Robin for automatization for each email that's going to send to this email address. But with some specific rules only if the incoming conversation has the email address named rca fox carriers as the… recipient, this email going to use the automatization to be distributed between the team. Does it make any sense?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  So you have a test, you have a test, I'm looking at your mailboxes right now, I see an operations team and an ops team one at fox carriers.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Yeah. So the operations team, it's our main inbox for the whole team. But for now we are using the ops team one as a… just to start with the hiver, you know, I want to add the teams one by one to ops team one inbox, make them familiar with the system, how to operate correctly. And after that, you're going to cancel this inbox and use only the operations team because I can't make this test on the main inbox operations team because it received all the emails for, from all our customer and, but only the targets team using hiver right now.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Understood.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  So they don't need all the email.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. And it sounds like we're going to want to create and this is something we'll get into more details on the next one or two calls. We're going to want to create some automations based on certain criteria, right? On if it comes from this or if it's addressed to this, then automatically assigned, to one of the team members.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Let me see. Just checking how we're doing on time. Okay? So the next phase of what I'm going to want to do is I want to just review scheduling with you. As I mentioned, Ashley, I can move as fast as you want. So if you wanted to meet tomorrow and Friday, I could do that. If you want to slow it down to next week, I can do that. We can get this up and running fairly quickly. The next call. I want to schedule about an hour that just gives us plenty of time to walk through all the details. I know you gave me a high level of, you know, the dispatch is coming in and you're interacting with regarding updates. I want to walk through that whole process so that we better understand. And then we can set up, start setting up your configuration. So automations, assignments, things like that. In terms of timing for that, what do you think works best today's Wednesday and, what time zone are you both in?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  We are in Eastern Time zone and we definitely going to schedule it for next week next.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Week, okay?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Yeah, because this week is already really busy and we can make Monday and Tuesday.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Monday or Tuesday, just checking my schedule. I can do Monday a little bit later so I could do three eastern on Monday, it's.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  really late.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  What's your operating hours?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Yeah, it's actually from seven a M till four PM, but I know myself if I'm going to have all other meeting during morning and I just don't have like any, you know, any brain power to have another meeting at three PM.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  No problem here's. Two options. Then there's here's. A few options. I can do 11 a. M on Monday, 11 a M eastern or?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  11?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Or 12 30 on Monday?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Yeah. Let's do 11 on Monday. Sasha, are you available this time? Yeah, sure. I'm good.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. I'm going to put that right now… 11 eastern.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I will do that. I will, you don't need to prepare anything, but I'm going to send you just a sample of the question. Some of the questions we go through again think I'm just trying to understand the whole workflow. So how does the email initiate? Is it come directly from a dispatcher from a customer internally? I think you have some different scenarios. What does your team do with it? How does it get assigned, right? These types of questions will go through? So no need to prepare anything written. But just so you can start thinking about that. That's what we'll be covering on that call on Monday.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Got it.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  And I'm going to send this over to you. So you have it. But I want to just show you as well. I think you kind of saw you might have interacted with support… myself. Raghav, we're here as resources. We're here as long term strategic partners, but we're not the only ones supporting you. So we have a wide array of ways that we support you. We have a knowledge base. I still use this almost daily. If there's something that's maybe particular, a feature that I haven't used in a while that's searchable. Our support team is incredible. They're available in two ways. You can email them directly at support at hiverhq. Com. My preferred way is actually live chat and they are available 24 seven. So if you have an issue, you can't log in or something's not interacting the way you think it should, you can get immediate help from support and you can do that 24 seven. Of course, myself. Raghav, we're here for those more long term strategic types of conversations. But if ever in doubt, feel free to include us. And then I have both of you involved here in the onboarding. Is there anyone else that's going to be involved that I should be aware of?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Maybe you could add Stanley, our general manager, he won't be in our integrating process, but he wants to pay the bills. So, I think, you know, I think you must know him.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. And his name was, you said Stanley?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Stanley, yeah, I suppose you guys have his email. It's Stanley at foxcarriers. Com?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. I'm sure we do, but I will just note this down. And Stanley, you said he's the, it sounds like he's the decision maker, what's his role over at foxcarriers?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  He is general manager.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  General manager. Okay, perfect. We'll note him down as well. Always good to know who's involved in both directly or indirectly. All right. And then last, oh, go ahead, Raghav. Sorry.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'll let you complete?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  No, no, no. I was going to pivot so go ahead.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thanks for that. Ashley and Sasha. Just a couple of questions, you know, just in terms of adding the team on to hiver, I noticed that you've probably added like 10 people in the last two or three days since signing up, and you'd mentioned that there's going to be another sub team that's going to be added before the end of the month?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Any idea how many people there would be? Assuming we're looking at three teams on hiver? By the end of November? What's the total count of people on hiver?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Yeah. Let me see.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  It's going to be around 15, I hope, but I'm not sure. I hope we can add 15 by the end of the month.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So you're essentially by the end of November, if your plans are going to pan out, you're going to be having a team of 45 people on hiver, right?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  I hope.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Now, the only reason why I ask is a, from a training and a next steps perspective for Eric and me as well. This gives us a bit of understanding on how many people we might need to have, you know, what kind of sessions we want to run so that we can always schedule it accordingly based on that. And the second question that I had was for these sub teams, do they go by any specific term within foxcarriers? Like some companies have like within operations, they have fleet managers, they have excise and customs managers, things like that. So do all of these teams, are they just called operations team as a whole? Or is there like specific titles for each of these teams?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  All right. Yeah. First of all, we are 24 seven. So we have day team. We have night team. We have morning team operations team, and also we have tracking team. They also day night and morning.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  And maybe once we fully set up with the support department, we're going to add our QA, our quality department as well.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Makes sense. Yeah. And also, we have like we have a division on the teams inside of our. So we have, if we are talking about the operations, we have morning team. We have three days team. We have two nine nights team and we have track and we have one morning, one day and one night. Okay? And also, we have probably we're going to add the location team. It's going to be day and night.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. That makes sense. That gives us a sense of it. You know, the reason why I asked is we also work with like really solid logistics players in the us. You know, we worked with flexport and arrived logistics for like more than five years on hiver. I just wanted to see if there's any recommendations or best practices we could recommend for your team as well down the line, you know, if we know this kind of level of clarity on detail, that's just going to make it more easier for us to make hiver more useful for you in a shorter time frame, right? So, yeah, that's it from my perspective back to you, Eric, thanks Ashley.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Perfect. No, that's great. And as Raghav alluded to, right? We're here to support. So it sounds like we're going to have a phase one with these one or two teams maybe by the end of the year as we evolve, we can continue this process together, optimize train the additional teams, right?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  So we're here to fully support as you both get onboarded initially. And then as we slowly add in additional teams. So I just wanted to add that note.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Great. I appreciate your help guys.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yep. All right. So this is, I'm going to send you this. So you have this information, I will send over the invite for Monday to go through that review. Any last questions from either you, Ashley or Sasha?

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  I don't think so. Sasha, do you have any not yet really?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. So the next call is where we're going to dive into a lot more specifics. So it'll be a substantial conversation which will be great to better understand and help set us up for success in the long run.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Great.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  All right. Well, I really appreciate meeting the both of you. Raghav and I are excited to work with the team and help get you up and running.

Ashley Connor (ashley@foxcarriers.com):
  Great. Looking forward to our next meeting.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  All right. Thanks so much. Have a good one. Everyone. Bye.
