Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, Victor. Good morning.

Vic Iphone:
  Hey, Rakesh. Good morning.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  How are you doing?

Vic Iphone:
  Not too bad. Just driving to work, just calling in from my car.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Alright. I hope you're on a bluetooth or speaker, you're not driving and poking at the same time. I do want to make sure that it's.

Vic Iphone:
  safe for you. No, this is not.

Vic Iphone:
  Yes, all good. But Adrian and Patrycja won't be able to join. I think they're pretty busy in the mornings especially… but I mean, so far, so good. Everything's going? Okay. We set up some, you know, all the mailboxes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I noticed.

Vic Iphone:
  Yeah, that we wanted to set up to try. We did notice that we also needed to add an alias to each inbox to include that. Yeah, so far it's been good. So we haven't really debriefed yet on how the week went. Okay? But yeah, I mean, so how long do we have till the end of the trial?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm checking that is active until the fourteenth of this month. We've got two more days to go.

Vic Iphone:
  Two more days, okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Alright. Are you going to be catching up today internally? Or like what's the next plan?

Vic Iphone:
  Yeah. In the next two days, I think we're going to catch up. Alright, I'll let you know over email.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. And other than that, do you want me to help you with the pricing information or things like that? I mean, do you want me to maybe send you some pricing details on writing?

Vic Iphone:
  Yeah, if you want to, and I can give you some feedback before the end of the two days. I can run it by the CFO as well to get to see what he thinks. Sure. So, yeah, that'd be great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Alright. Let me put the pricing in writing. I mean, we're looking at a pro subscription, which is a middle tier plan. And would you require the AI add on to begin with? Or would that be like something later you would want to look at it?

Vic Iphone:
  Yeah, I don't think we're going to start with that one.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Alright.

Vic Iphone:
  So, got.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It, let me put a proposal for 10 people. I believe you mentioned there are three to four support reps, and then three or four operations, two management folks all in all. Would 10 user license suffice the need for now?

Vic Iphone:
  Yeah, but I just don't think we have 10 people that are ready to use it at the moment.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Vic Iphone:
  It would have to be some sort of ramp up.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Alright. Yeah. I mean, if that's be a need, we can always onboard probably one team at the first go followed by the next teams, but we are looking at say around four mailboxes. You said three are already there. You've got itl, LTL customer service and tracing group. So these three are already set up?

Vic Iphone:
  Yeah, but we have more.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Vic Iphone:
  I think probably up to like five or 10, but I thought the pro subscription has unlimited or?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's what I'm trying to ascertain now, how many definite inboxes do you want to start with? I mean, all in all, how many do we require?

Vic Iphone:
  I don't know like 10, maybe, I don't know how many we have, but around 10.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Alright. So let's say we're looking at 10 mailboxes and to begin with, how many users would be there to manage these 10 inboxes?

Vic Iphone:
  So right now we have three, but eventually there's going to be 10.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Alright. Now, at.

Vic Iphone:
  the moment or more, I don't know.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, are we looking at 10 users and 10 mailboxes for the pricing purposes so that we could put that in writing proposal? Yeah. Sure. Alright. Now, when you say you've got three currently, are you saying that you're yet to hire the seven folks or are they still there? But they're not onboarded on hiver as of now?

Vic Iphone:
  I just don't know, I mean we could, we might reposition some people from current roles. I don't know. Okay, but we don't have like a specific person that's going to start using it tomorrow?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. Okay? In that case, what I would recommend is, do you want to have an internal catch up call today or tomorrow whenever you get to speak to your team. Do you want to confirm the actual number of users you're interested in to begin with, considering you're looking?

Vic Iphone:
  At it's three.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Alright. So we do a bucket of two, five, 10, 15. So we're looking at five user subscription to begin with. Now, I understand you've got a need of two three people license still doing five to begin with. I look into the best possible options that we have got. Okay now in our elite plan, which is the top tier plan. We have got unlimited inboxes. The pro subscription allows us to have five inboxes, which is not going to be ticking boxes for now because you definitely require beyond five licenses mailboxes. I would say, let me go ahead. Have a,

Vic Iphone:
  no, not necessarily. So we have 10 or more, but that doesn't mean in a month, we can't have five, we can condense them anytime.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. We've got by the way aliases as well like you already figured out, right?

Vic Iphone:
  I think we're going to do the pro plan for sure at most.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And if there be a need, I can even go ahead and, you know, help you with addition of, I would say this email aliases, we can even look at the Gmail forwarding as well where you can still have. Yeah. All right now. So let me go ahead and put a proposal pricing for pro license for you. Okay? And can we then reconnect on Friday by then? I'll keep your trial active?

Vic Iphone:
  Let's chat in the email. Let's chat in the email, send me the proposal. I'll run it by the team and then I'll let you know, and maybe we can meet by Friday.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure, sure. Absolutely. Let me drop you an email with a proposal and I look forward to then hearing back for you in case I don't hear back by Friday. I can give you a call. I think I've got your number as well. I just want to make sure it's two, two, two, two, two four, five, nine five, double five one seven.

Vic Iphone:
  Yeah, just email is fine. You don't need to. I work in my email every day.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. Then. All right. Victor, anything else that I can be of help to you today?

Vic Iphone:
  That's it. Thank you so much.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Thank you for your time. Let me put this proposal in writing and get back to you on an email. You enjoy the rest of your day. Have a safe drive goodbye.
