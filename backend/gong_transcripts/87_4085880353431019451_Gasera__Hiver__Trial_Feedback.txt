Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Irene. How are you?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Hello?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hello. How are you doing?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Good, good. Thank you for asking. How are you doing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Good. There's a few of us coming to this meeting.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  I shared the link to them.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, are these your teammates? Yes?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Okay. Four of them?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cool. So, Irene, do you want me to, you know, take the whole team with the training or would you want me to take any questions that they might have? How do you want to move forward with this meeting?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  We've had a few days to just a few days to test this hiver. So I think maybe the team has any questions about the use could be the first course of action or then the training because after that, you'll kind of know what was the?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  There should be still three of us coming.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, we have three more people joining it. No worries. We can wait and then get started.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I was just looking at your trial account, Irene, and I can see there are four people apart from you who are currently part of the trial, and I think we have all of them here except Mikel and I see Stina and jukka, I'm so sorry if I'm pronouncing your names wrong, but these folks are not added to the trial. Is that right?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yes… we're still figuring out how, and maybe we will add other shared inboxes. So now we currently have the support but we might need a service inbox also, and it's kind of we are figuring out how to use hiver.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, services also has its own designated email address, which you are using. It's also a group account, right? Like you have support. Okay? And the 14 people that you were talking about, all of these are like working on both the inboxes, sort of overlapping between both. Is that how it is? Yes. Okay. No problem. Then let me know if we have everyone now or?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Quickly check where Mikael is and I will be back.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no worries.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  We can start, Mikael can't make it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. No problem then. So let's do this since we have everyone, let me first give an overview or a demonstration of the platform to everyone, introduce hiver to them, so that everyone then knows what the platform looks like and what it does. And then we can take up the questions and accordingly, you know, I can answer all of those as well. In the meantime, while I take you through the demo, you are feel free to sort of interrupt me, stop me in between and ask me those questions if you have it right there. And then does that sound okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, that's fine. All right. Great. Thanks for confirming team. So let me share my screen with you all and we can get started if anyone can confirm my screen is visible. I think Mikael is also here which is great. Yes, we got you. All right. Great. Hi, Mikael.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. So I think you have joined right on time. So that's okay. So here, I'm sharing my screen to sort of introduce hiver to everyone. I have been in touch with Irene. We have been having conversations in the past and I'm helping her evaluating if hiver is the right tool for you and the team today.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  The agenda was just to give everyone a quick understanding of how the platform works. I know not all of you are currently using hiver but to have the understanding and how the day to day workflow will change from how you're doing things now. I think that will give a lot of understanding as to what we are getting ourselves into. So just as a quick introduction of the tool team, hiver is a platform that helps you managing your generic common inboxes that all of you are today responsible to manage. So, hiver works within your Gmail itself which you're currently using anyway. And all you have to do is you log into your Gmail account. As you're doing today, you have your personal inbox here wherein you are receiving and sending all your emails on an individual level. Now, in order to get started with hiver, you just have to download the Chrome extension of hiver, you will anyway be invited to the shared mailboxes, and you just have to accept the invite. And that way you would also have hiver placed within your Gmail, that you would notice here in these yellow colored folders right now, from here, as you can see, these are different shared mailboxes that I am part of today, like finance, healthcare info support. I'll take an example of support here. Let's say you are part of the support inbox today and how things will change now is from these sections that you see, you would know what email belongs to which category in the sense, whenever an email comes in or any new email that's written to support at the rate those emails will go into the unassigned section, which means that these emails, nobody has picked yet in the team. These are brand new emails now since it's a shared inbox. Of course, we would have all the team members, whoever is part of this inbox be clicking on these emails and clicking out of these emails. So we don't have to rely on the read and unread functionality of Gmail as long as they are in the unassigned section. That means that these are the emails that we have not started working on yet. Now, for example, if I click on the let's say this email, as an example, you will have this activity. Panel on the right side. And this will help you giving the ownership to begin with as to who needs to work on this particular ticket or an email. Let's say I assign this to myself. Now, two things will happen from here. Whatever activity that you perform in hiver, everything will get recorded in the real time so that, you know, in regards to any email, what all we have done, what all changes we have made, who has assigned an email to who? And once I assign, this will now go into the mind section of the person to whom we have assigned this so that at all times, you know, okay, these are the emails that I am responsible for. I don't have to worry about the unassigned one under team section here. You can see across all your team members, who is doing what and who is handling what email. So that at all times we have that visibility and transparency. So that if let's say I need to go into matt's email and I want to understand what's happening here. Let's say I need to pick this up from here. I can easily go ahead and reassign this to myself, right? So that is available. If I want to give a, matt a quick note, right? I need to exchange something in regards to this thread instead of me messaging him. Otherwise, I can just share internal notes right within here itself, right? So I can mention anything and we both can talk in regards to this email in hiver itself. So this will be for your internal communication that could happen on your email while you're working. And if you have any question, you want to connect with your manager, your colleague or you are into someone else's email and you want to get some updates, you can also mention that here. And that person will of course receive a notification and you all can sort of converse in regards to any ongoing thread, right? I'll just take a pause here quickly. If there is any question from the team on the assignment?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, I think that's clear. Okay, perfect. Thanks for confirming now, of course. So I showed you a manual way of assigning this email to yourself. But sometimes it might happen that we would have, you know, done some automations from the backend which will let these emails automatically assigned to you. So you will directly see them in your mind section and you can start working on them right below the assigned section. You would have the tags option as well, which will help you categorizing your emails into different buckets. Right? So today, if you're receiving different emails in the support inbox related to different topics, we would be creating these tags. Anyone can create these tags. It could happen through a manager. It could happen by our supervisor or at a team level. If you think that creating one tag called as billing will help us categorizing all emails related to billing. So that when you are going under the tag section here, you would be able to see all the tags that you have created collectively for everybody's purpose and ease of reference. So that if I just want to look at emails related to billing, I can just go here and fetch all those emails in one place itself. So this is something that could be useful for you when you are working on emails and you should be using the tags and apply those as you are, you know, as emails are getting assigned to you. Now, of course, like I mentioned about the assignment, this can be automated as well. So we can automatically tag some emails. So you don't have to tag them yourself or through AI. We can auto apply those tags through AI as well. So those will then get automatically applied here, right? So this would be the tag thing. And then when you're working on any email, there are a couple of things that you can do here as well. Team number one is the email template. So templates are going to be helpful to you. In terms of responding to these emails, there would be a repository under email templates. This is where anyone in the team can create a template. It doesn't have to be just your manager or someone who is the admin of this shared mailbox. Anyone can create the template depending upon if there is some repetitive emails that you keep receiving, you are giving the same responses to those instead of typing it out. Every time we can create these templates here. And when you're working on any email instead of writing that response, you just choose the right template by going into the template section, search it. If you have some keywords in mind and you can just directly apply those. And it's good to go, you mark. Send, and if you're not expecting any more response, you just close the status too or you just close the status here. So all your emails initially would be marked as open as they're assigned to you or if they are in the unassigned section, whenever you are done working on any email, you will go ahead and manually mark this as closed. So that now this will not be here in your mind section. This will automatically be moved to the closed section here. Or if you're marking anything as pending where pending is something you could use when you're expecting a response, it's going to be delayed. So you don't want to disturb your view. So if you get any response from pending or closed ones, they will come back into your mind section so that you don't have to worry about missing these emails or responses on these once you have changed these status. So this would be your day to day workflow as to how you'll be using the tool. Any question, any specific thing that you would like to achieve, you can ask me. I would be able to then help you resolving that as well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  If not questions like feedback in terms of how you're handling these today, do you think that having something like this could help the team in terms of being more productive and making sure that we are not missing out on anything, just looking forward to, you know, a general feedback on the tool?

Jukka:
  I don't know. Did we get to use this yet?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I see you are not added yet onto the trial.

Jukka:
  I mean the rest of the team at gasera, did you start using it? And do you have any initial feedback how it works?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yes. So I think maybe I'm the one who's had the most advantage of this add on in Gmail. So, but I've liked this a lot. It makes everything easier to manage the emails. So I really like it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I think as the team also start using it, they would be able to then see the functionalities, how it's sort of, you know, making everybody's life easier in terms of managing and collaborating on these emails. So yeah, I think once everybody's on board, they start using the tool. So Irene you were saying that you would have one more inbox created with service email address? Is that the one you'll be adding the rest of the team members to?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  It depends. I haven't talked with everyone on the matter of how we figure out these teams that, who will be officially… in the Gmail in the shared inbox because it's like we're a small company and everyone kind of does everything but who are the people that are officially part of support and officially part of service? Okay? Got it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So you'll be like discussing it internally and then decide as to who eventually needs to be part of these. So today, within the Google groups that you have of support and service, you must have like a list of people who are already receiving all the emails from these groups, right?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Everyone receiving.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Everything. So.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  This is why we kind of need to, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, it does make sense. So eventually, then you'll have to decide who are going to be the ones who will actually be working on these two email addresses, and the rest of the people, of course, if they are still in the distribution list, they can still receive those emails in their inbox. So that will not change anything anywhere. Perfect. Great. Any other question from the team? How you would like to take it forward? Do you, because I know that the trial is also expiring in next two days. So, what do you suggest we should be doing as the next step?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  I think for now, if does anyone have any questions?

Mikael:
  Any questions? No, one thing during the trial that I noticed was that some default settings which I had active in Gmail before caused some clutter with labels and where things go after I mark them a certain way, such as from my normal inbox, if I marked something… as what was it completed or closed? It disappeared from the like common inbox. Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So you marked something as closed, yes. And.

Mikael:
  it, the, it also disappeared from my like sent emails and stuff. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, that's a good question as well. Mikel. So when you are working on any email which is part of the shared mailbox in hiver, and if you're marking something as closed, that email is not going to be in your mind section anymore. It will also not be in the send section. You can find it in the all views under close section here. And this is where all your closed emails will be. So anytime that you want to refer to the ones that you have marked as closed, you can go here in the closed section, you will be able to find it for your reference and for your ease, what you can do for this is you can create a custom view for yourself wherein you click on this plus icon under all views and you can choose yourself as the assignee and mark and choose all the status across open pending closed. And you just create this view for yourself. So that if you want to just look at all the emails that are assigned to you irrespective if they are open pending or closed, you will be then able to see them and have this view here. So you can star mark it also if you want. So that it comes right here itself and that's where you will be able to see all the emails which are related to the shared inbox and includes all the status. Does that help?

Mikael:
  Yeah, thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. Cool. Any other questions from the team?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  I have a question. If a team… member has hiver installed and has marked an email thread closed and it changes to the closed section? What if that person deletes the hiver? Does that delete the email that's being classified as closed?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no. So, if you are deleting a user, so you're saying that what if you remove someone from the shared mailbox or remove someone from hiver? Yeah, or.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  The person removes hiver stops using it. So doesn't work with hiver? Anything?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that will not change anything. That email will just be like, see, so what will happen there? Is that user is going to be shown as, you know, not active in the users here. So currently, all of these are active users, right? So whoever is not active, you will see grayed out like this for the one who is already out of the inbox, the emails will not get deleted. It's just that they will be in the team section, whatever emails that are assigned to them, they will still be assigned to them. You can just go ahead and assign it to someone else. Since now, they are no longer part of the shared mailbox. So the emails will not get deleted. Okay?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Thank you. That's good.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Did anyone else have anything to ask? Yukta?

Mikael:
  No, not for me.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then, so should we do this since now we have done a little bit of training as well? Do you want to test this with the team for next couple of more days as well? And then we should reconnect, take your final feedback by. Then, you can also decide internally as to who needs to be part of what, and eventually how many users you would want to onboard in hiver. And then we can take the pricing and other discussion. And then I can help you with all of those things as well.

Mikael:
  Can I ask one thing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, sure.

Mikael:
  If say, I have an email chain which I mark as closed and the customer then replies to that, will it automatically change the status from closed to open?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it will, so it will come back into your mind section so that you don't have to keep checking the closed section.

Mikael:
  Yes, thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And that goes for the pending ones as well. If you're marking something as pending, and if you get a response, that will also come back into the mind section again.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. And also just wanted to add one more thing for the team since, you know, I am here of course. So you can always ask me any question. But as you start using the tool, you have the customer support team that, who is available like around the clock. So you can always start an instant chat with them here and you would be able to get your answers in case you have any question big or small doesn't matter. So you can find it here through chatting with our agent or you can go to our help center. And this is where you will have all your answers if you have any questions you know, related to the tool. So these are the two places that I would want everyone to sort of leverage if they face any problems.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Great. So Irene, what do you think? Like? Should we connect probably today's? Tuesday? Should we connect on Friday? Like, will that be good enough time?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Friday?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Actually, I'm not in office. I'm on leave. Sorry, so we could either do Thursday or we could do Monday next week.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Monday would be great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Monday. Okay. Cool then. And let me also get your trial extended although 14 days is the max time that I could get like approval from internally. So I think that should be good anyway because I'm not in office on Friday, so we can connect on Monday. And then till then the team can keep using the tool and I'll take your final feedback, help you with the next steps. And then we can take it forward from there.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  That's great. Thank you so much.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Alright, no worries at all. Irene. And thank you so much everyone for joining in. Take care. Bye bye. Thank.

Mikael:
  You. Bye bye.
