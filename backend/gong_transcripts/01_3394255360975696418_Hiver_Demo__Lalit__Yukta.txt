Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Lalit. How are you?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Hi, Yukta. I'm doing good. How about you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you. Shall we get started with the discussion or expecting more people to join in as well? No.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  No, we can start.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Thank you firstly for scheduling this with us. I'll be helping you with the evaluation today. So if you could just help me understand a bit in terms of, you know, what made you look out for a tool like hiver? And accordingly, I'll be in a position to sort of, you know, give you a brief demonstration of the platform.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  So, we were looking for a, we were just a startup with very few guys. So we were just planning to, we have already a product which is being sold and the customer also needs a ticketing system. So just wanted to understand what kind of services do you provide? We need currently only the assistance through ticketing and support through email, we already have that email, so we can either manage ourselves or do we have any other option available via hiver or something? So, just wanted to understand what all services do you provide? What is the costing and everything?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Is this for viom, yes, that's the company, right? That you're working in and this requirement is from clients and is what you said?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  No, no, no. So we have a client, but we are thinking to provide them a ticketing system.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. A better solution in terms of the management and support, okay, correct. And the current process is wherein the, it is handled through email, right? Correct? Where customers reach out to you and how many people do we have in this team who are responsible for taking care of this?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Around two.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Two people? Yeah. Any reason why between two people like I'm, assuming you guys must be logging into the same account and then picking these emails right from this?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Correct. So, we have not even started the proper support because it's just a very primitive state, but we wanted to, you know, build a system all together because we are expecting soon that there are some contracts being lined up so soon there'll be a few more clients. So to have a proper smooth process.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Have you started the business recently? Yes. Okay. How long has it been that you've been in market?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  It's been one year when we formed the company, and now it's been like three months when the things have been sold.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Amazing. All right, then, Lalit, what I can do is I can show you how the platform looks like how it works, and if this is something that aligns with what you need, then we can probably, you know, build from there and have those conversations. I hope you can see my screen here. Yes. Okay, perfect. So hiver, just a quick introduction. It's an AI powered customer service platform. It helps you sort of managing the support inquiries that come in from the customers. It is a ticketing solution but a little different than how you see in the market like a Zendesk, Freshdesk, and these solutions that we have, it's more simplified best suited for small companies. But we do have, you know, clients ranging from small, the mom and pop shop to, you know, some of the largest enterprises as well. How this essentially works is you log into this URL which is app, hiverhq. Com. And using your outlook credentials, you'll be logging into hiver, like I have done here. And once you do that, we will be creating the shared inbox, which will be connected to your support email address that is being logged in by multiple people today. And this is how you'll be streamlining the whole process. So, these are the different shared inboxes that I am part of today in my company, which are connected to these generic email addresses in each department. So it does not just limit itself to the support, but you can actually expand this to other departments as well as long as you have those generic email addresses that multiple people are sort of working on. I'll take an example of support here. This is the inbox that is connected with the support email address. You can add as many people as you want into this. And everybody will be accessing the same inbox by logging into hiver. And this is how the process is going to look like wherein you would have these sections that will define your day to day workflow. You will have a designated section unassigned which will contain all the new emails that are being written to this email address. We can play with some automations in the backend. If you want to automatically assign those emails to a specific person in the team, we can do that as well in the backend. For now, I'll just use this hiver activity panel that you see on the right from where you can actually assign emails between different team members who are part of this inbox. So pretty easy in terms of anybody can assign to anyone so that whoever is the owner, that person can take that ticket up and it'll go into their mind section here. And this is where I'll know these are the tickets that I'm responsible for. You would also have each activity getting logged in real time so that we know which person has made what changes, what automation has been triggered, if we have set up any in the backend. So this would be the assignment, just taking a quick pause here in case you have any question before I move forward.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  No. Sounds good. You can continue.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. With the ownership, you would also have these tags to sort of bifurcate your emails into different categories if you would want to do that, maybe by each client that you're working on by different topics, that you get these queries on the support inbox, you can actually create these tags from scratch as per your own workflow. Because then it becomes a lot easier. For example, if I want to apply a tag, new customer here, I already know this email is about a new customer and I don't really have to go through it completely. And here in the tags, this will become your repository where you can just quickly go into any topic and just look at all the emails associated with that tag. So this can help as well. And of course, this can be automated as well. And while anyone is working on any email, there are a couple of things that they can do as well here, right? While responding, you can use hiver AI which trains itself on your company details, and you can actually feed anything that will help AI to train itself and be able to help you sort of drafting the replies for your emails. Understanding what's mentioned there. It can also help you with any question that you have. So that the team members, the overall team is a lot more efficient and faster in terms of responding to these emails. Or you can also use hiver repository wherein you can put all the templates in one place for the repetitive standard responses that your team gives to these emails. You just have to insert it here. You can make changes through AI, compose in case it's needed. And you just hit send. And once this is done, you would come here, change the status to either pending or closed depending on the progress on the email. If you're marking it pending, it'll go into the pending section under all views. If you mark it closed, that means this is a closed ticket. And any response that you receive on either of these, they will come back into the mind section and will change the status to open again so that you don't have to keep checking these. And since we are looking at a support use case, it's good to have a SLA as well set up in the backend. So that we know what policy and what standard response time we are following as a team. So that under analytics, if you want to just gauge what's the average response time, how much time are we taking to reach out to our customer? If we have created our own SLA, you can actually gauge as per the time that you have set up for the team and understand how much of the percentage we are actually. Losing and not be able to adhere to these timelines or policy that we have created. So these are the different reports also that you can fetch on a timely basis as per when you're interested. So this is how the generic use case in terms of how it's going to look like for you, any specific questions, anything that you want specifically from the tool? Happy to answer that?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Yeah. So in terms of ticketing, can we have like a mail has been received? And then automatic reply as you told? And the ticket would be created, it will be sent as in to the dls, the list of the guys who will be responsible to handle that with some mttr or SLA to be monitored. Yeah, there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Wouldn't be any ticket number or a ticket assigned. So this is the step that we are skipping here or eliminating that additional step of turning each email into a ticket. And then it goes to a specific person. Your emails will come as emails only. And from here, you just pick those emails, assign it to the right person. So it eliminates that additional step for you to turn everything into a ticket. But it does everything that a ticketing tool does, which is all what you mentioned.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  OK. But if the customer wants to check what is the status of that ticket, how will you manage through email?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So currently, we don't have it here and I think that is something which could be helpful from a customer portal perspective, which wherein they can raise a ticket from a portal and they can see the progress there itself on their portal. That is something which is currently missing in this. We have two products. Actually, this is the hiver Omni that I'm showing you. We have hiver for Gmail as well in that we have the customer portal, but it's not there yet here but it's going to be coming very soon. I think in next three months… from that portal, customers can actually, it's customizable so you can actually make it whatever details you would want to fetch from your customer. They go to that portal, raise the ticket, see who it has been assigned, exactly.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Actually, my requirement is that only that I need customer, okay, transparency so that they can track it where exactly the things has been reached. What is their SLA, where did we reach? What is the mttr? And all, so they can fetch the report. So our model is like that, oh.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You want it for customer? Not? Okay. That's why I asked you like when?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Do you think you'll be able to launch that product in coming future? Oh, see.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Even if we do have customer portal, it wouldn't be as, hello? Hello. Can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me? Lalit?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hello?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Hello? Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You are audible. Can you hear me?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Yeah, yeah. I can hear you. Well, now, I think we.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Lost. Yeah, yeah, no worries. So, what I was saying is even if we have the customer portal, it's not going to be as detailed as what you just mentioned in terms of giving you those reports from, you know, from client's perspective, from their side, they will be able to see that much. I'm just trying to open customer portal to show you how it looks like in Gmail. And if that looks good to you, and then we can discuss about time by when we have it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Just give me a moment, okay? Because.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  frankly speaking, what you have shown me is more or less possible through standard Gmail, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, not really. You wouldn't be able to like, this is a full workflow of, you know, handling incoming requests, right? That's not something which you can achieve through Gmail or outlook, Unless you want like a ticketing solution. So, this is how the customer portal looks like, right? Wherein the person can see these details. Basically, they can submit a request. You can customize this, whatever details you would want to fetch. They submit it from here. And these are the details that they will be able to see.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  These are internal to you guys, not to the customer.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, this is for the customer.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Okay. So this is what you're going to be launching soon?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This we already have in our Gmail product is what I was saying. So you can actually create a customer portal for your customers to have their logins from where they can raise the tickets and they can track it, whether it's been assigned, what's the status, whether it's open pending closed. So, these are the details that they'll be able to see but not the analytics part that you mentioned or the SLA part that you mentioned.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Okay. So, SLA, we need to maintain internally? Yeah, whereas what you can do is to provide the web customer portal, where they can track everything. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is there a reason why you would want to give that possibility to customers in terms of how your team is performing against their requests?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Yeah, they have, we have an SLA, and we want to be a little more transparent to them that if you're raising a ticket with a priority, P1, P2, P3, whatever it is. So in what time are we responding back to you and so on? So the requirement is such like that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. In that case, maybe you might want to look at a different platform in the market, which gives all these details as.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Well, yeah. By the way, what is the pricing of your tool including the customer portal?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Pricing is, I'll… just show you. So these are the different plans that we have… starts from… the starting plan that we have.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  25 dollars per user per month. If it is an India based company, currently, I'm in uae because I'm a partner in the company, but if it is an India based company, then the pricing would be ninr and would be different, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no. The pricing is in dollars itself.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Okay, standard. Yeah. Okay. This is AI compose summarizer. What about this free? What is the difference in both the items free and the paid?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We wouldn't have those things that you're looking for. It has, it gives you one share inbox. You can create that add as many people as you want, but everything remains manual in the free plan.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can handle everything. You can manage everything, but you wouldn't be able to create automations, you wouldn't be able to create tags. There are no analytics. Those things are missing. Okay?

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  But tickets can be created here with the free also.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You can create a share inbox, you can manage it manually.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  You can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Explore that if it works for.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  You? Yeah. Why I'm saying free one? Because just to explore something, it's always better, right? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. We have a free trial also by the way. So you can actually keep an account, give it a try for a week, how it's working for you. But as per my recommendation, the core thing that you're looking for, I think hiver is not going to be the right fit for you from that perspective.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Yeah. Understood. Cool. Then let me explore at least what exactly you guys are offering? And let me compare it with the competitors, what they are going to be offering. And then in case things suits to me, I'll get back to you. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Sounds great. All right. Thank you.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Thank you so much, Yukta for your time. No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries at all? Take care.

Lalit Mukhi (lalit.mukhi@viom.tech):
  Bye bye. You too. Bye.
