Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  hi, Luca. Hi, Leander. How are you?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  I'm doing good. I'm doing good. How are you doing?

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  I'm good too. Thanks. All fine.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome. How has the busy season been for you? Was business good this year?

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  Yeah, it was quite intense, but good, positive. So a lot of stuff to do. And now it's already getting slower and I think the biggest part is done and,

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  it's fine. Awesome. Glad to hear that, you know, glad I've been good. I've been good. I've been traveling off late. So the entire team, our entire team was in India. A couple of folks from the us were down there. Me from Finland. I flew to India and my folks from across India met up. We spent a good like week together in bangalore. It was real fun catching up with the team meeting in person just given the way, yeah, given the way we work in this remote setup meeting and spending time together definitely has a lot of impact.

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  So, normally you guys are remote… everybody's remote?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Especially the customer success team and customer facing team. Since we're spread across the globe, we mainly work remote and once a year, at least we try to meet up and spend time together. Yeah.

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  Okay. So then that's a little something special when everybody meets, it's not the normal daily business. Cool. That's nice.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's not really work. It's more fun, you know, but we try and get a little bit of work done though.

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  Very good. Sounds good.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Nice. Awesome. So, Luca, I wanted to keep you informed about an important update there's. Been a bit of, you know, shuffle here at hiver and there's a bit of a transition in my role because of which going forward, I would no longer be managing horl, mugunth, as you see on the screen, he would be your primary point of contact or customer success manager for horl. Yeah. So I'll just pass it over to him to say a couple of words before.

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  Okay, cool. Yeah.

Mugunth:
  Thanks. Hi, Luca mugunth here on the other side. So I'm the customer success manager here at APAC. Now, I've been tasked with an additional responsibility of managing select few accounts based out of EMEA region. I have over close to eight plus years of experience in pre sales solution, consulting and customer success, excited to partner with you with my previous employees. Employers. I extensively worked in the eu market. So I'm just going to come back to my territory where I managed in the past, excited to work with you, Luca, and setting up you for the success.

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  Cool. Thanks. I'm looking forward to work together with you.

Mugunth:
  Awesome. So.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you know, Luca, just to keep you informed, I have updated mugunth about your team's use case, what our recent conversations have been in regards to over the past few months. So you don't have to repeat yourself too much. However one thing I am currently, you know, informed mugunth about and something that we're going to continue to work towards are the AI tasks, right? Something that we had a conversation in November, how we can manage our workflows from an AI agent perspective. So that AI tasks, can, you know, answer questions such as what are the shipping of a particular product? Where does it stand? What is the status of the shipping? So, while today's call is just going to be about a quick introduction. I just wanted to check with you last time we had set up an automation to automatically extract information and make that available in your workflow. Have you seen that working for your team and pulling out the right information? Or did you like what's your, I?

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  Think what we implemented there was the extract of the order number into this special field on the side. And that is working as far as I'm into it. Now, it's working and it does exactly what we wanted in this case. Yeah. So that's fine.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Okay. Glad to know that, you know, the initial part is working, but that's just one part of your workflow. What we intend to do is complete that workflow end to end, take that order number connected with your tool, pull in that information from the tool and make that information available in a drafted email on your hiver setup right now. So one quick thing I wanted is I wanted an update on, is your team still using central or have you now moved over to sap?

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  No, it's still using central and the transition process is starting now. Okay? So it will take some months and I think, the final change to sap will be like in maybe July or August. Something like that. Okay, depends on how the project works and if everything works out directly.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Okay. So realistically speaking, we're still seeing around a runway of around six to seven months before you'll completely transition into sap. Yeah. All right. Perfect. So actually for today's call, I just wanted to introduce you to mugunth, give you an update on the AI tasks. I did have a conversation with our AI project manager this morning.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  He did mention that we should be able to get this AI task set up or up and running for your team. However we would need another meeting sometime next week. So I'm going to pass it over to mugunth so that you all can both check your calendars, book the call next week and you all can then take this conversation ahead to get that AI tasks workflow up and running, at least… to test it out.

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  So what's the aim for the call next week exactly so that I can understand what maybe I should prepare for or what's the idea?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So. Luca, if you remember, we had met in the month of, November, the sixteenth to be precise, and on the call was my colleague Anurag, right?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  And we discussed about an entire workflow you would like to achieve, start to end with the help of AI agents, right? To summarize it. It was basically when an email comes in regarding asking information on the lines that, hey, what is the status of my order? The AI agent would pick up that email, pick up the order number from that email, look into your ERP system, pick up the status of what the order number, or rather what the status of that specific order number is, and then draft out an email saying that, hey, this is the like drafted an email for your end user saying that, hey, this is your order number. This is what the status of the order is, and let it be in the draft section for your end user to only see it, review it. If it's good, send it out that's the workflow you're looking to build. Yeah.

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  And can we already know or can you already say what would be necessary to do that connection for example with the ERP? Because of course, for the moment, we have to challenge everything what we do with xentral now because in the future, it will change. So for me, it would be interesting what would be necessary to get the data for example, out of xentral? Is it easy? Or how would this part of the workflow function?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  That's a good point, you know? And I wish I could answer this for you, but I'm not too technical. So our product manager, Suraj would be the best person to answer this for the call. What he did mention is that we can set up. So he did mention that we are adding an API support for an automations. So probably what we can do is we can set up like an initial call next week to discuss this in more detail. Maybe a 1,520 minute call if you want. And then we can set up another follow up call after that to implement that entire workflow, right? Unfortunately, Suraj was out today, so I was not able to add him to this call. Otherwise, ideally, he was supposed to be joining this call, but because of that change, he was not able to make it. But nonetheless, if you're available next week, we can set up a 1,520 minute call to go over the initial phase of implementing this workflow, what requirements would be needed from your end? If at all, we need to integrate via apis for a tool like or rather to a tool like xentral, just for the initial phases to test it out and to have a proof of concept. If this would work as per your, you know, the way you imagine it in your head and then we can take it ahead from there.

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  Okay. Yep. That's fine. Yeah, sounds.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Good. Sounds good. So, mugunth, I'm going to hand it over to you so you can just quickly look at your calendar, cross verified with Luca, if that works, and we can set up a call accordingly.

Mugunth:
  Thanks, Leander. Hi, Luca does 11 am cet on Tuesday, work for you this Tuesday, which is on feb, third 11 am cet.

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  Tuesday is not so good. What about Thursday?

Mugunth:

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):

Mugunth:

And I'll also ensure that Suraj is joining this call so that we could do the initial scoping about the integration as well as we'll try to see how effectively the AI tasks fit into use, play along with the integration and AI capabilities which we discussed earlier. Okay?

Luca Schmitz (luca.schmitz@horl.com):
  Fine. That's good, sure.

Mugunth:
  After this meeting, I'll be sending you a quick meeting invite and then we'll take it forward from there, Luca. Yeah. Excited to work with you.
