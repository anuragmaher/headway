================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  oh, yo, Eric. What's up, man? Hey, what's up, dude? Is my?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Audio fine or does it sound like robotic?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, you're good to go.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Okay. I think it was just an issue the other day.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Jess.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Said, I sound like some crazy robot.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I mean, if you do have a software or something that's doing that, let me know, man. I'd like to sound like Morgan freeman on steroids.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We've got Mason here. I've added Suraj just to provide our cover in terms of talking about AI, task B tool or the AI topic reports, got access to fitma, but he's here for backup. I'm just letting him in.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think we'll just get feedback on everything, right? AI, and they've been doing a lot kind of over the last few months and so just kind of get an understanding where they stand and how we can support.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And the SLA part is sorted out if you could just take the transcript piece and put it in the feature request part in hotspot that will close the loop for us. Okay? Letting Mason in, we should kick it off, Suraj, bro, we'll run the call or rather I'll run the call. We're just here for feedback. I added you just for AI cover support if needed to talk about topics and tasks on point five.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Cheers, man. Thank you kicking us off.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hey, Mason. Hi, can you hear us?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  There we go.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Here we.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Go.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  How are you doing?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Good. How are y'all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We're good. I think I'm going to slowly start getting used to seeing equal number of note takers as attendees in every meeting we go to… all right, Mason, are we expecting anybody else from the magicschool team or just you from?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Yeah. So, Sarah will be joining. She'll, be coming in a few minutes, but Amanda, we will just fill her in. Got it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Started. All right. I think we're good to kick off. So, Mason just resetting the agenda at the top. We had three primary talking points that we wanted to chat about on today's.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Call one was effectively pure feedback from you and Sarah in terms of any AI functionality that you've explored tested and tried out since the last time we spoke any workflow related questions or doubts you have and general feedback based on your process and business priorities for this year.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Yeah. Did, you said from the top? Did you have a list or something you were looking at? Just wanting to?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. It's on the calendar invite. Okay? Got.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  It. Okay. Sounds good. Let me take a look. So we have been making several changes… and I will say the one automation that we have been using the most that has been working probably the best I would say has been just like a out of office like for holidays and things like that just because we have been a little bit more on the skeptical side of putting in some of the automation since we had the whole thing happen a few months ago, where the tagging was, it was incorrectly tagging things and then automatically then closing them. So we kind of have just been a little bit more on the hesitant side with some of the automations. I think that could be something that we start to look at maybe soon. But before we even got to that point, one thing that Sarah and I did last time was go back in and start to retrain all of the tags… two things with that. So that's I have seen the tagging now be more accurate, which is good. We took quite a bit of time just going through a ton of previous emails just to retrain. And so that is showing to be a lot more accurate. Now, one thing though neither one of us were able to figure out and I noticed that like some of the things just have been updated over time, which is great. How to remove a tag. Like we no longer need this tag. How can we delete it? Because when we were both looking at it, this was two weeks ago. Both Sarah and I, neither one of us could get it to go how we normally would remove or delete a tag?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Understood. And for all the just to clarify, you mentioned some automations and all this tagging for this specifically, we're talking about AI tagging for all of this, correct?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Yeah. The AI tagging for within the emails. Yeah. So we did go back and retrain. So we have seen a lot more. We've seen it become a lot more accurate now. Perfect.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. That makes sense. Now, one thing you did say was you wanted to remove the AI added tags. I'm sorry, I was confused. I thought there was regular automations and normal tags being added. So thanks for clearing that up. Eric. So Mason, can you share your screen? And do you have an example that you could show us? We do have Suraj from the AI team as well?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I was going to say, I think it would be helpful for us to see what you got cooking in there and we have Suraj from our product side, who can kind of help as well. If there's anything, he can add any color?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Yes. OK. Let me… hey, Sarah. Hey, what's up, Sarah?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Sarah, just to recap, I was just telling them that what we have mostly started to do since the last time we chatted was going over how like the main automation that we just have been using has been when we are out of office, like for holiday. And then the other big thing that we have been doing is retraining all of the tags, the AI tagging.

Sarahseaman1:
  And then, thanks, Mason.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  OK. So when we went in, where was that?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Yeah, there was, at one point there were like one or two tags that we wanted to remove, but we didn't see a way to do that.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  OK. So one of these that you added looks like it's not fully trained and you've decided you want to remove this entirely. Yeah. OK.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  When I edit it, I can only.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Suraj, how would they remove this fully from the?

Suraj (suraj.s@hiverhq.com):
  Hey, Mason. Hi, Suraj here. So this, what you're seeing right now is basically the training part of the tags. So what you're seeing right now are all the tags that are being trained right now, that you sort of apply and they are being trained on the emails right now. So this is not for removing it.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Got it. So, is there a different way that we would like, we don't need this one? This was just something that we were trying to internally track for like a month in the fall, but we no longer need it. Yeah.

Suraj (suraj.s@hiverhq.com):
  So, none of your emails have been trained on that so you can see that it's zero out of 10 emails. So this tag is no longer being applied to your emails right now?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Yes, but it still displays, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Mason, I think I got your question. I don't think we have the ability to remove it once you've included on any part of the training module or post training now. I think Suraj that's probably going to be a feature request for us, sure.

Suraj (suraj.s@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. Yeah.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Got it. OK. Good to know. Thank you. Of course. All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. So that's the piece about the removal part of it or the tagging piece as a whole, I did say last time that the signature was causing some conflict in AI tagging. Did you also notice that training model and everything? Hello?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. Turn off video, you cut.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  For a second. Yeah, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm going to disable video for bandwidth, but yeah, folks, Sarah and Mason, one thing you mentioned last time about AI tagging was that sometimes the signatures were also being considered in the context of the AI applying. The tag is just reconfirming if that's no longer a concern or if you're not noticing that in terms of accuracy of AI tagging?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Got it. So, Sarah, this was like that one instance where it had like the word virtual?

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah, I haven't gone through, I haven't gone through individually. I haven't seen it happen again. OK? But like I don't think that it's a solved issue per SE. I just think that it like is a rare issue and without going through every single tag which defeats the purpose of the tag, yeah. Yeah. Then I probably would not find it again.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that makes sense.

Suraj (suraj.s@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sorry, go ahead, Mason. You're.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  good. No, I agree with Sarah. I think part of that was because… the headache with that was because we had an automation. And so, when that, when the AI tagged, it then closed it. So I haven't noticed it's the same as my answer would be the same as Sarah's. I haven't seen it but it's kind of just.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Not happened so far. Totally makes sense. Mason. The reason I brought it up is because Suraj is there from the product team. So if there were any examples or you had noticed it since starting to retrain, I just wanted to give him that visual of you sharing and sharing your screen, but by and large, if it hasn't happened, it'll just be a note for us to take back to the product team again. Just make sure that that's part of the accuracy driving measures we'll be doing on AI tagging as a whole, right? So, yeah.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Yeah, I would say honestly being 100 percent transparent with y'all, the priority really for like the past six weeks has just been being able to kind of get it cleaned up a little bit like especially in terms of first response time, just because there were so many of those discrepancies and those pain points. Sarah and I have been working really hard and trying to like we updated, the AI tags and automations are pretty much all disabled just because we don't want things getting automatically sent out or closed. So that may be something that we look at next. But for really the past six weeks, the focus was being able to get the first response time down just because once we started using more of the AI features and automations and things like that, we actually then started to see first response times increase.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. And when you say response times increase, does that mean the team now takes a little longer than you previously thought to actually get out the reply… or like in the sense of, is the team getting faster or is the team getting slower basically?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? Like you mean, like, is it taking us longer to respond to emails? Yeah, you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Said the response times are increasing, right? So I wanted to see if that's the team's doing a better job and you're getting more accurate response time metrics or is it the other way around, so.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  When we first started using the AI features several months ago, that is when we started to see response times increase. So since then disabling, well, not disabling but not utilizing those features and starting to then look at like what is the actual definition of first response time? Because some of the pain points where when customer success would be cc'd on something and a reply wouldn't be needed, seeing that response time then start to really grow if someone responds out or responds months later. And then it looks like it looks like we haven't responded when there has been this really large time gap. So now that we have started to adjust some of those things, we're starting to see response time start to come down, we've seen it go down just a little over an hour first response time just within like two weeks of changes. So I think that some of the AI features, like I said, we started using more of the AI tagging. I think now that we are getting to that point like starting to look at that more, that is something that we are willing to look at. But we wanted to first just get the first response times down. And Mason, I have a question and Sarah feel free to chime in too if you have anything. I.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  have a quick question because I know last call we talked about this and Raghav suggested… in automation in order to capture, you know, basically capture in your first response time metrics, the emails where your team is truly like the ones that are responsible instead of just copied. Is that something that's been implemented?

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah. So I can jump in here. We went in and this is my question that I have is, I guess like how are you guys defining first response time? And like where is this editable? So I, we went in and created an SLA policy that was like that we call first response time and I like went in and edited this to make it to where that like SLA only is responding or applying on inbound conversations. And so like that should what I'm thinking and correct me if I'm wrong. Is that like that should start that timer when someone responds and not when we send. And so I guess I'm just curious to know. Is there like a different definition to first response time that exists somewhere that we like don't have editing access to or how do I like really get under the hood to understand where the metrics are coming from? I can share my screen?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I was just going to say if you share what you've set up there. I think that would help us understand. Yeah, yeah, because this can get pretty tricky.

Sarahseaman1:
  Totally hold on. Let me get into.

Sarahseaman1:
  Okay.

Sarahseaman1:
  Okay. So.

Sarahseaman1:
  Okay. There we go. So I went in here and so we had our SLA, like called first response time that was created within here. And I like went in and played around with this. And instead of so I like was playing around with conditions. And so I like changed this instead of this being all conversations because I believe what was happening was like when we used our group email and it was being like cc'd on something then that was starting the timer. Okay? And so when I like edited this and again, I'm like I'm guessing here. So I believe that when I edited this to make it apply on inbound conversations. And then I also like changed some of the tags or like did not select all. So I removed some of these tags so that it wouldn't respond to timer at all to like some of these AI tags. Is that how the system is set up to work? Or am I just making things up?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So with what you have, this will only apply to those inbound conversations. And yeah, I think that was part of our recommendation last time was to make certain tags so that it's not pulling in every single conversation. What are the tags that we have here? Oh, there's quite a lot.

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah. So there's we basically just like said, yes, everything is great. Let's not do. Thank yous. Let's not do close lost. And I don't know what this Guy is. I've not seen any emails with that tag on it. I think it's just, this is one of those that we would probably need to remove if we had that ability. So, and,

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  these tags are all manually added by the team or do you have automations in place?

Sarahseaman1:
  There's automations on here. It's a combination. Okay?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  So, by that logic, this should look at those… inbound conversations only apply this first response time if it matches one of those 17 tags that you have here. Let me see what else you have here. So we have SLA, first response, 12 hours. And so, I think the big issue last time we spoke was your team gets copied. Let's say, I don't know if it's from sales or from another team, but they're essentially having a conversation. You're copied on it. You're not always expected to be a part. It's more for visibility. Are those emails excluded with these tags? Like is there a different tag for those types of emails or?

Sarahseaman1:
  The answer is not yes and not no. And so it's just very dependent upon like I think sometimes these like emails come through and like they start talking about something. So a tag gets applied and then it gets looped into the first response time. It's not clean. And I don't know what the automation or the setup would be to like not include… that. I would love some like recommendations there.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  To not include that, we would essentially want a separate tag that's not listed as an SLA. And Raghav, I know you had suggested something. I think this is along the lines of what we had suggested last time, but if you have any additional thoughts essentially, we want a way to identify those ones where you are just there for visibility and not like an active participant to be able to move those at least to give you a better, you know, a clearer picture of your team's actual first response time. Yeah.

Sarahseaman1:
  And then I guess my follow up on that is like what's the workflow there? Is that a manual tag from our team, like we see this coming in and we're just like let's just edit this only. And then we remove this only tag, just random example from that SLA.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  So, looking back at my notes, I think there was something Raghav. Again, if you remember, I think it was something around the CC fields in order to tag it properly. So like if it was the CS in CC, I don't want to butcher it, but do you remember what the suggestion was? Raghav specifically?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. I'm here. So the scenario that we discussed Nick and Sarah last time was basically, if the success inbox is in CC, then we don't want to run any kind of SLA timer on it. We only want the SLA timer to run when it's two, the success inbox, the logic there was CC usually comes in for past conversations being reopened and that's realistically not a measure of first response or resolution time at that time, right?

Sarahseaman1:
  So that's why. And so where would that be when I'm like going through the hyper admin panel? Like what are my steps to like successfully create that?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So what we would effectively be doing here is two steps on that. Now, the first thing we would be doing is associating a tag, you know, just call it non SLA or something like that. Keep it pretty straightforward. And what we would be doing is creating an automation flow that says, whenever there's an email received in the inbox, so your triggers new conversation is received, the conditions are going to be, if you know, the shared mailbox address is in CC then and not in the to field, go ahead and create the, add this tag added basically.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Can we have Sarah share her screen? We can help her so we can see it? Yeah.

Sarahseaman1:
  That would be great.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Instead of just in theory, let's actually see it in practice. I'm visual, so that would help, I.

Sarahseaman1:
  Know I'm visual as well. Like if I do it one time, I can repeat it a 1,000,000 times. Okay? So it would be in automations. Yeah, great.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So before we do this, yeah, X this out. So we'll first need to create a tag that says, non SLA or something along those lines. And that'll be our measure for excluding those numbers from the reporting.

Sarahseaman1:
  Okay, great. Sorry, I'm having all the screen share things are popping up and being crazy with me right now.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Take it down, no pressure.

Sarahseaman1:
  Okay. Let's get this out of the way. All right. So.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  So let's start with the shared mailbox that you want to apply this to. Great. Oh, I'm sorry, if you want to go out of the admin just to add this tag that we're going to add into an automation. Okay? So you can X out of that and then go to tags.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Great.

Sarahseaman1:
  And then just add one. And this would be just like I don't know Mason, what do you want to call it? I?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Was going to say like, yeah, viz, I think like visibility, something along the lines.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Cool. Now, we.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  can go over to the automations.

Sarahseaman1:
  Great.

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, perfect. Create new automation. Okay. So, the triggers are fine. Click on, add step. Great. If condition… yep, select condition then this?

Sarahseaman1:
  Would be CC?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  CC does not contain. So the second dropdown next to CC, and you say does not contain, oh, sorry, mixed it up. So, CC contains?

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. The full email address? Okay, great. AI, and… yes, now you should be good and drop… down again to, does… not contain, does?

Sarahseaman1:
  Not contain customer? Yeah, that's.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  about it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just give it a bit. Yeah, add step action, scroll down a bit great. Add a tag and that'll be the visibility one. Great. Perfect save and enable.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  And that's basically the,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  automation, I would.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Suggest naming that real quick, just so you remember what it is? Number 10? Oh.

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah, great. Thank you guys. I know these are all like the little things that you're like in the moment.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  It's sometimes easy to miss in the upper left.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Yeah. And then I forget that save button.

Sarahseaman1:
  Okay, great. So then we're good to go here. And then, so then I would go back to the SLA, whoa.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Oh,

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  do the tag deletion? Is this the same one that you were just showing us? Yeah.

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Did we… it was at 17 before? Did we delete one?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Oh, did I figure out how to delete a tag?

Sarahseaman1:
  Maybe I?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Deleted the Indiana one?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Like while we were on the call when?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  It was, when it popped up, I was like, is this how I actually delete it? Because, ah,

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  okay.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Got it. Okay. I didn't realize that it would affect that?

Sarahseaman1:
  Okay. Is there an ability to add an additional condition? So, could I say like… because this is supply SLA, on inbound conversations with any of these tags?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's what you've configured? Yeah.

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah. And so, the visibility tag is disabled, which is like what we want. But do I need to add a secondary layer that's like and never apply to? Oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  no, we wouldn't need to do that. So, the reason I made you create the visibility tag is because at the end of the day, when you're pulling reports, tags would be a part of getting you that right numbers and the right data?

Sarahseaman1:
  Right. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just a second. Sorry?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, apologies. So, yeah. So what you've created right now, Sarah is basically what you need to get the SLA only running on these 1,617 categories and B, when you pull out the report, you do one extra layer while you're getting the reporting side of it, saying also exclude visibility tag and that should consolidate the numbers and give you just the 17 categories and the applicable SLA timers for both. Is?

Sarahseaman1:
  There a way my like next question, is there a way with the reporting? Because I think we've like done a lot to like clean this up and like, yes, like moving forward, the numbers are going to look better, but I'm like worried about some of those like very far right outliers that like have always existed since this was messy. Is there a way that we can like truncate the date or like only start tracking SLA from like today on? Or can we like erase? Erase is not the correct word, but like not include some data that we know is going to skew, definitely.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Custom reports would be the route to take there. So, Sarah, if you could or Nicole, if one of you could clear your screen again.

Sarahseaman1:
  I got you here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We go.

Sarahseaman1:
  Okay. All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right now, back to Gmail. Yeah, perfect. Go to analytics left side. This one. Perfect custom reports, this little plus section here, this one?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Oh, great. Thank you. I.

Sarahseaman1:
  Was like Mason's been doing all the reports. And so I'm like my God. Okay, Mason, first response. Okay, beautiful. And so then,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  oh, yeah, we'll need to do the plus here. If you want to set something up from scratch, you're editing one that exists. Both are possible. I mean, you're good with either just to show you the process, click on, choose a metric and say first response time and that's all of the filters inclusion and exclusion. So, the one major thing we need to do is say does not contain over there right above that. Sorry you scrolled as I was drawing. Oh,

Sarahseaman1:
  yeah, yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And.

Sarahseaman1:
  that's it. Yes. And then get that visibility tag out.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And if you're just thinking of like past emails, I mean, there's two ways to go about it, right? You could start now that we have this set up. Okay? Like February is cleaner data. Yeah, you could do it retroactively but you would need to then apply that visibility tag, which you know, might not be worth going through old emails because it's still going to factor that in if you looked at say December, right? So two ways, if you really wanted to try to figure that out, it sounds like a pretty tedious task. I would say maybe now that we have this automation in place, we now know moving forward, okay, February should give us cleaner data because we're removing those and you'll probably see that right?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  As soon as you come into the reports for February, you'll probably start to see that number go down because I'd imagine you have some inflated emails in there where, you know, you guys were cc'd and just never even or you responded, you know, three weeks later one time and that shoots that number up.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Can you clarify? I'm not sure if I caught it. So like I created the customer report, the one that says Mason, do I need to change anything for that outlier part or no?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  For the outlier part, yeah.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Like what Sarah and I were saying, like going forward?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Can you, if you want to go to your, is this Mason? Okay?

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah, it is. Yeah, this is Mason.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Let's go to filters. Yep. Got it. And then does not contain the visibility. Okay? So this would filter those out. But again, you know, you haven't had that tag before. So there's none to filter out yet.

Sarahseaman1:
  Correct. Got it. And then this would just have to be like we could go in and say, like, yep, save changes. And then we could go in and like edit these dates and that will include any of those trailers.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  And just something to think about like you can mass apply tags. So like if you knew, like if you go to customer success, for example, and go to any of the views, oops… if you close out of the, I was just going to show you if you close out of admin and go to mine, go to mine under customer success. Thanks, Raghav and you click on the checkbox next to the two emails.

Sarahseaman1:
  Great.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Raghav's got my annotation. You'll see here the little flag on the above page where's my annotator. There we go. Oh, wait, is it the wrong one? No, not that one, the one.

Sarahseaman1:
  Next to the.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Tag, yeah. So you can mass apply a tag, got it. So, again, just thinking, if you knew, like, hey, these 20 from last month were just pure visibility and you wanted to apply that visibility tag, you could do it in an easier way than going in to every single one. So, I just wanted to point that out in case, no.

Sarahseaman1:
  That's good to know an,

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  exercise that you wanted to do or, you know, you could kind of just start clean, moving forward totally up to you.

Sarahseaman1:
  Great. And then my last question for you guys is like, my goodness, what are we doing on time? My last question for you guys is surrounding… the knowledge base. So, I was going in and playing around with the knowledge base and it looks like and I can share my screen again just to be all on the same page. I was like, I have to, you mean?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  Like the live documents?

Sarahseaman1:
  Yes.

Sarahseaman1:
  What are your abilities? Yeah, what are your abilities for this knowledge base? I… know that there are, hold on. Let me get this actually pulled up and stop talking for a second.

Sarahseaman1:
  Mason, do you remember where this knowledge base is? I'm just like I haven't stage fright, apparently, no.

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  You're good. Not that.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Oh, you're looking for the knowledge base? Yes. It should show up on the left panel. I'm actually not sure why it's not showing up on your left panel… let,

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  me see if I have it.

Sarahseaman1:
  And I'm like I'm losing my mind right now?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  No, you're not, it should be on the left hand panel. There's a separate knowledge base section, Mason, do you have it?

Mason Nichols (mason@magicschool.ai):
  I'm looking, I just see co, pilot tagging QA, sentiment,

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  And on the very left knowledge?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Base? Yeah, no, I was just going to chime in saying the knowledge base is an administrative level feature, which means you've got to be like an account admin or a subscription admin across the whole account for you to be able to see or access it in terms of updates and stuff. But with that said, Sarah, could you, I'll pull my screen and show you what the?

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah, because I can get, so I can get to here so it looks like I can connect to notion or like upload custom documents? Is there like a more advanced knowledge base that I'm missing? Because those are my questions?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Great question. And while I'm getting the screenshot up and running, could you talk us through your expectations of what you'd like to see as well? Yeah.

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah. So I was just, I was curious about we used, so we have like a knowledge base that's attached to our like intercom, which is our like in app help center. And that is like, I have only peeked into it like once or twice. So I haven't gotten into like the super nitty gritties but that's like a Google drive integration that I believe that our team has. And then when I go in and look at like kind of like the knowledge sources, the ideal scenario would be to like not have to right? To only have like one center that we're having to keep updated. That could apply to multiple tools. And when I like look at the types of connection sources, it looks like the only living connection to where you could like update and live changes would retroactively impact the documentation is notion. And so like my questions are like, is there like a Google drive integration? Is there like any sort of like is there any integration coming down the road that could like connect to systems that we already have for a knowledge base? Great?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Question. So Google drive is one of the integration or knowledge base knowledge sources that we're working on. So we look at this as two routes at hiver, right? One is a standard knowledge base kind of like an faq documentation similar to what's built out on intercom, right? So that's you know, a separate feature in itself and that's what I'm pulling up right now. Now, within this, we have the basic knowledge builder functionalities, which is categories subcategories you build out your things and your documentation as a whole from here, right? That's one route of going at it. But within this knowledge base of hiver as a feature, it does not have versioning as one of the supportive things. We don't have approval mechanisms and things like that built in just yet. So with that in mind, what I'd suggest is we focus and before I give a suggestion, I do want to find out. So the only intention for this knowledge base as we're chatting about it is more along the lines of getting it connected to AI, right? Yes. Yeah.

Sarahseaman1:
  Got it. And that would also just be yes to like kind of set up some of those like automated responses or like this is actually pulling from the documentation that we have uploaded and not from like, oh, I remembered the other day in training that someone said this thing. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, it makes total sense. So then in that case, I think we can, we don't need necessarily need the hiver knowledge base just out of the gate for two reasons, why, because you're already maintaining it on intercom, which is in turn fed by Google drive as your primary source for updating as a business, right? So what I do is I'll I know the ability to connect Google drive as an external source similar to notion is in the works. Okay? As of my discussion last week, our initial timelines were tentatively late Q1, which is basically any time between the second and the fourth week of March. So what I want to do is I'm going to talk to the AI team again just to refresh on the exact eta. And once I have that, we don't need to worry about anything else outside of it. Because if Google drive is your parent source.

Sarahseaman1:
  Correct. Then we're good to go.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly, right. Yeah. So let me chat with the team, circle back on it. And that way just like notion, once it's launched, you will get Google drive, you're connected to the spaces or the documents and folders inside that feeds in your upload on Google drive, we get the most accurate data. AI basically works on top of it beautiful.

Sarahseaman1:
  And like we are notion company as well, just for y'all's information, it's just our notion is all our notion is all of our internal documentation and like we store all of our kind of like external customer facing and our Google drive. And so when, I started getting the notion connected and I was like, oh, wait, I don't want this to have like sensitive information or have like a separate space that we need to be like filtering through. So that's where this concern came from.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Makes total sense. So if I'm understanding this correctly, notion is mostly internal policies, company structure, things like that. Yes.

Sarahseaman1:
  Yes, yes. And like internal training. And so like sure it would help, but I wouldn't want for someone to accidentally get something in there and be like, oh, I'm going to share this with the customer and we're like.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, you're not… so, yeah. No, makes total sense. So, Google drive is 99 percent what you'd want your agents to use when they're chatting to a customer and they need to pull on material data there. Understood? All right. Let me park this, talk to the team, put an email update. Once I have timeline clarity and once that's ready, you should be sorted on AI.

Sarahseaman1:
  Using.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  that as it's great. And.

Sarahseaman1:
  thank you guys so much for helping set up that automation. Yes. I was just like, yeah.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  I had a quick question, Sarah, is it the support team that's using intercoms strictly for chat? I'd imagine.

Sarahseaman1:
  Yeah, it's mainly for chat and it sometimes goes, we have like an additional support email that is for our like for… our free users. And so, and like Mason, you can speak to this more. I'm basically summarizing what Mason has told me in the past, but I, yes. But I believe that like support team uses that and like, so it's kind of like living between like two sources right now and like if there could be some sort of like mother upload mothership connection that would be ideal… okay?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Cool. Yeah, that was just my quick question. All right. I know we're almost at time. Raghav. I was.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  just going to jump in. I did want to chat about a couple of other specific AI functionality. But now that you've got tagging up and running, I think it might make sense for us to maybe chat again in a week, a bit more of your feedback on the accuracy side of it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And by then I should have timeline update on the Google drive integration for knowledge sources for AI and what our fleshed out AI based automation builder is going to look like. I did have a chance to check out the prototype before the call shaping up really well. I'm excited, but I'm going to give you folks a couple more weeks of breathing space just to get used to outcomes for what we've discussed today and then have that discussion when you're ready. Yeah.

Sarahseaman1:
  Great. I appreciate that so much.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. As always, folks. If you do have calendars open, I'd like to get something tentative on the books. I will be on pto from the eleventh to eighteenth of February. So, ninth or tenth of February if that works. Yeah, we do the tenth same time.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  How dare you take time off? Raghav?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Tenth of February, same time works, Steve? Yes, this works.

Sarahseaman1:
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm just going to quickly check Eric's calendar as well. Looks like. Okay, actually, can we do like 30 minutes before 10 30? Yeah. Oh, whoops. No, actually 11 works perfectly for both of us brilliant folks.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Tentative invite one hour block, tenth of February 11 to 12 eastern meantime as always. Any questions, doubts write back to me and Eric. We'll get you sorted out there and I'll come back with two updates on the timeline and the AI task version two. We use a little bit of feedback discussion like we did today and then jump into the next phase of that. Yeah.

Sarahseaman1:
  Great. Brilliant. Thank you guys, so much, all right?

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  Thank you back to.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  You, Eric for closing out.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  No, I think we're all set. Yeah, you'll notice some differences now with the automation in place. So, I think it should be really good to get comparison. Feel free to run it how you want. But it might be good to run a report now to see what it looks like when you guys were copied versus a cleaner data set moving forward. And then again, that'll give you a good baseline a bit more of an accurate representation so that you can use that moving forward. Yeah. Good idea, yep.

Sarahseaman1:
  Mason, will you grab that? And then?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Drop.

Sarahseaman1:
  it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  in yep.

Sarahseaman1:
  Great. All right. Thank you guys. Have a really lovely Tuesday.

Eric L (eric@grexit.com):
  You too. Bye.
