Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Samantha, this is matt with hiver. Can you hear me?

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. How you doing?

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  Good. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good, good. So, yeah, the agenda for this call today, just wanted to help you determine if hiver is a good fit. So, yeah, if you want to start here, tell me a little bit about, you know, what motivated you to book this call today.

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  I have a staging business. I'm just looking for help with organizing everything and responding to customers and all that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So, yeah, hiver's main function is for managing shared email addresses. You have a shared email address, staging address. I think I see, right? Yeah, awesome. And is it just you who responds to these emails or are there other people?

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  Just me.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. So, hiver is a bit more built for more of a collaborative approach team. You have to buy at least two licenses to use. Hiver… actually wait a second. Here. You use outlook as well or?

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. Actually, yeah, actually, no, we have a free version.

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  If it's just, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Is it just one mailbox you're looking to have?

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So basically, this is what hiver looks like. It's a web application. You're just going to log in using your Microsoft credentials, you're going to connect the shared email address that you have, and then you're going to have a folder for that address. And then all the emails that get sent to that address are going to be in this folder.

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  Yeah, I'm just looking if they can do automatic like replies, just like reminders when we're going to come stage and then reminders for scheduling D stages. And yeah, we can set up like all the automated emails through there.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Not really hiver's not too good at that. No.

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  Oh,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  yeah. Okay.

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  What is it for then?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hiver's more like basically, what happens is companies come to us. They say, hey, we have a support email for our business and we have 10 support people managing it and we want to better manage it amongst the team. So more things like that. Yeah, it's not the greatest fit for staging or real estate.

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Do you know of one that is?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You might… want to check out superhuman… it's called?

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I would check them out. They're better for more, just like single use. And then the other one I've heard is fixer, F y XER. So I would maybe check out those two.

Samantha Boit (staging@samanthaboit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you for your help anyway. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely, Samantha. I'm glad we didn't waste too much of your time and I wish you the best. Thank you. Thanks. Bye bye.
