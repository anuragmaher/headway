Date: 2026-01-29T00:04:02.089+05:30
================================================================================

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  children.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Sorry about that. Sorry for running a little bit late. How are you? I'm.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  good. I'm good. No worries. Yeah, absolutely on time. Erica just joined. And the next was you, are we expecting Justin to also join?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  We were, if he can't make it that's fine. I'll just send him a message and, okay to get started in the meantime.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  No worries. Firstly, I'm so glad we're meeting finally because I was just having like a really bad throat. I just decided that I would not be able to talk for an hour. And thanks for understanding it last minute with that said I'm Sonali, I'm the customer success manager at hiver for surgical.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  And I recently, just before coming into this call, I spoke with kram as well about the account status and we just checked on our part the moment like invoices are paid. I think it should be like moved into the paid account. So you'll be good there. But I mean, that shouldn't stop you from using the platform, any which ways you are on a trial account which should give you enough, you know, enough features like pretty much all the features to play around and start like configuring the system. And once it's moved to a paid account, it's still going to be the same platform. So all the efforts you do now are going to reflect then as well. So yeah, I'm just happy to get this started. Let me just start sharing my screen and we can work on how we want the onboarding plan to go about. So how ideally it works is we have, yeah, we have like this first call, we do a discovery where I try to understand which team is using, how are you going to use hiver? A lot more details on the configuration front, what all features are going to be the most useful or important to you guys? I'll just try to dive in more in terms of which features I would be recommending after hearing what you want to achieve out of the workflow, like workflow optimization at hiver. With that said these all things are something we do on the first call. It's going to be a quick 30 minutes of like me asking you questions, you answering these certain questions. And the last 10 minutes, you can ask any questions that you have with respect to the setup at hiver. And the next call is going to be the configuration call where you'll basically share your screen. We'll go over the admin panel. We'll try to set up all of the admin panel features which are going to be important to you. And then like this data that I'm going to collect from today's, call. I will also try to curate a lot of suggestions that I can give with respect to tags or like custom fields and like different other setups. And then post the next call, we do something known as the user training where your users would be present and we'll train them on. The user interface side of hiver and on the configuration call, it's optional. Usually some people prefer to do the admin training on the configuration call itself which is like the next call or else we can also set up like another 30 minutes for that, which is like the admin side of training where you will basically learn how to set up different automations and custom fields and different other things on the admins front. And, or else you can also merge that admin training with this report training. Like these two can be made into one training and that can be delivered. But report training is something we ideally do when you have used the platform at least for like seven to 10 days but there's some data to interpret and like we can sort of make dashboards and reports. But yeah, there has to be some data points in order to do that and post that you will be graduated from the onboarding. So, yeah, I mean usually what I do is I tend to see how quickly you want your onboarding to be completed. And then we sort of backtrack from there and we give like different other dates. So, yeah, I look forward to hearing from you. How do you, how quickly you want to be live with hiver? Yeah.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  No, I think that's great. I think that there are some things that we can start optimizing today. We do have a CM person that's joining our team on Monday. So I think it would be good to hold off on like really finalizing any workflows in hiver that we would be developing until he's able to come on board. And, you know, share his perspective and get the things that he wants out of this as well. So really excited about that… in that, I'm happy to give you just kind of a quick overview of what our business is and our workflow. If that's helpful.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean before that, what I'm going to do is I'll put some tentative dates. I mean, I hear from you that someone is like I think you're you mentioned someone I just missed it like is going to join on Monday?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Yeah. So he is joining on Monday, Tuesday. We're having kind of an internal workflow day and then if we could have a call, maybe next Wednesday, I think that might be helpful. I.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Can I can do a tentative invite and then we can always like, you know, change it? So what I'll do is I'll put like next Wednesday like same time as like today's… and then you can obviously like propose a new time with respect to matching it with like other's time and timings. And, you know, we can always work that out. But yeah, having something on calendar will like make sense that this is the plan or this is the flow. So, yeah, this is for fourth feb, Wednesday, next Wednesday. Yeah, that's correct. And then there is user training. I think it'll be mostly post that like one week post like the configuration. Okay. Yeah. I'm just putting tentatively eleventh and then report training. I'll put it for last week because like we want this week's gap so that the users are using it for this week.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  And then maybe on like 20 fifth is when I'm putting the admin training and report training. Okay. Yeah. So I'd leave your onboarding. Okay? I think I chose March somehow. Yeah. So I'd leave onboarding should be completed by like next one month's time, which is 20 fifth of feb is like again, it can be quicker as soon as you let me know that, hey, we want to do this in like next few days, we can always do that. Yeah, that's obviously workable. Yeah. Before you start, I'll just give you a quick overview. I mean, the team has me and Raghav, excuse me, he was not able to join. He's the account manager walks alongside me, he might jump in the last 10 minutes or if he's not able to make it to the next call, he looks after the commercials. So going forward, if you need to add more teams into hiver, or you want to add another few more users or you're looking at a price discount or like price increase that you want to discuss all of those discussions? Anything that has to do with commercials? Raghav is going to take care.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  I come in when there is anything that has to do with strategy is like you want to do a brainstorming sessions where you're like, hey, I want to achieve this. And how do I do that with respect to hiver? And I'll be like, OK, these are the options available to you. And this can be giving you like the pros and cons of this method is going to be this and like everything that has to do with like processes and configuration, I come in as like a hiver subject matter expert. And when it is about our team, I report to Lucas who is my manager.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  You can feel free to reach out to him anytime that whenever you need it. And, on your part, I would also need some information like quick information. I think you would be the main point of contact that's what like is mentioned in the sales handover. And you like additional shared mailbox, admin, who do you want to give it to?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  If you could add Justin on there, that would be great. Sorry, Justin, if he could be added on there as well, that would be great. Yeah, perfect.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  And then I would make you the audition maker… that's perfect. Okay. All right. I can fill in the details later. I think we're good here.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can, we can start talking about, yeah, you can start giving me the information that you were supposed to give. Yeah, yeah.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  I actually wonder. I see that Justin was able to join. He hasn't had any visibility into any of the features or support that's offered by hiver. Are you able to also just give a quick overview of kind of the?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  System? Yeah, I'll do that right now so that, you know, you have a quick overview and post that we can have a discussion. Give me one second. I'll not go in like a lot of like I'll not go into details, but I'll just quickly take you around the platform.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Thank you. I appreciate that.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Just allow me a moment.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah… I think you'll be able to see my screen. Yeah, perfect. So, yeah, for Justin and Erica, if you haven't seen like how hiver looks like this is a demo platform. So it's very chaotic out here. But pretty much this is how the platform is going to look like all of these configurations are something that is done on the background is why it's reflecting this like from inbox to draft on the left panel is going to be personal. So anything that comes into your personal email id is going to be only visible to you and not the team. Same goes with starts news sent and drafts sent will have a, my sent. And like, you know, it'll have a team sent and my sent. So in the, my sent will only be like whatever you are sending out and then all sent you'll see what the team is sending out. When I say that it is this part that has the team visibility. The first one is assigned to me. All the emails that will be assigned to you will be showing up here. These like icons right here are shared mailbox icons, and these are chat icons. So if you have a live chat in your website that is pulling in different queries, you would see them here. If you have only shared mailbox that you are operating out of right now where it's different teams, maybe a sales team. Maybe it's operation teams or a billing team, you would have different shared mailboxes. And when you like when you click on the view, it is first unassigned as in whenever an email comes in and lands into like say a support ad on surgical com or like sales at odd surgical. Com, it's going to land up here. And then someone can pick it up saying this is some email I saw and I want to pick it up and assign it to myself. Then this right panel can be, okay, this right panel, open up. And then here is where you can assign it. Like in this shared mailbox, only two members are present is why two options are showing me. And then there is like all these yellow icons are hiver. So you can always assign it to someone right here, assign it to your own self. And then once you assign, it shows up in the main panel where you click on. And then you see all of these emails that's assigned to you. You can start working on them one by one as you start working on different emails, you would see something like this. This is a part of shared mailbox. Sonali is assigned to it, which is me. And then there's status. You can always pending closed. You can update. The status and when you're doing close, it basically cleans up. So you're inbox is always very clean, but then you have access to those emails because they are part of the cloud. And then there is different other things that you can do at a time. An email can be part of multiple shared mailboxes. Like this is a part of data science and sales. And these are the custom fields that we have set up like this is not, you know, generic. It's not going to be for all the accounts. It entirely depends on your use case, anything where you need your agents to fill in some data that has to, that also should trigger any automation. Say, for example, I'll give you an example like language like say, this is an email I saw and I was like, okay, this is in French. So I'll just choose French here. And once I'm choosing French, then it gets assigned to someone else or there's an auto response sent out. Like all of that can be configured in the admin side. But yeah, these are the custom fields. And then there is this entire collaboration panel where I can just mention a user instead of like going back and forth with slack or like teams. I will just mention say, Kurt and say, can you draft a response? And then he can come like he'll get a notification right here. And then he can come back. He can draft a response for me. Share the draft. The draft will have visibility of the entire team. And then people can collaborate and form their draft. And then someone can send it. All of that can be done. And that's on the activity panel and collaboration side on. Okay. I think Raghav is here. Yeah. So and on like that's just quickly on the like collaboration side that's all the capabilities you have. You also have capabilities of like doing different templates, writing shared like shared drafts. You can share different emails you can use like your part has AI. So say you have opened any email like say this is an email. And this is an email I've opened and AI can do a lot of tasks. It can, you know, extract a lot of fields, perform different tasks and also auto tag, it can also find out sentiment of different emails. Like I was showing you in the first page, there are different sentiments right here that would start popping up whenever you receive an email and you can always use this data to know who is responding on different emails. How is that a bad experience? How is that a good experience? All of those sort. You can also send auto response to different users that have very negative sentiment. Again, it's all very like I'm telling you in a very generic sense, but it will entirely be curated according to your use case. And you see, these frts are basically slas. So if my SLA policy is, I have to respond to an email within four hours of receiving it, and the resolution has to be provided within 24 hours, that's something we would set up in the admin side. And then the users will see something like, hey, you know, the response was overdue or like you are approaching this time, like you are going to like, you have to respond to this email because the SLA is going to go, you know, the SLA policy would be violated. Like all of that is what you see like an overview. This is what the notification panel would look like. And if I go into admin panel, this is where you do a lot of setups. Like, so if you're an admin, the access you would have is to one moment. Yeah. So you would have all of these options. Like you can either like auto assign as in do an assignment for round Robin and load balancing where different emails are getting assigned to like different members based on like a round Robin assignment. Anyone gets any email. And if there is a lot more rules saying, hey, if it is coming from a certain email id, assign it to me saying, hey, if the email is from Sonali at hiver HQ, assign it to me and add the tag hiver, something like that. All of that automations can be created right here. Like you can create different automation flow. You can take templates or you can create something from the scratch. These would be the triggers like, you know, all of these options would be available to you saying, if you're sending an email, you can do different things. If you're receiving an email, you can do different things like the actions will entirely be dependent on what trigger you're choosing. You can also have csat with any csat that you're looking at any status updates saying, hey, if something is moved to pending, then do this like or if there is a tag added, like do this. So all of that can be done on the automations front. And there's auto response options. You can also look at different integrations. If you have other tools that you work out of and say, Hubspot, I have Hubspot integration. If you have something that is like a slack integration that you want, you can also look at that. Then there is different options of like setting different SLA policies, customer portal is also an option. Yeah, pretty much everything that has to do with email management. But AI, powered. I hope this was like a good enough quick overview.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  No, that's really helpful. Thank you. I wonder if it's also possible to see an example of the client portal. And I wonder what customization can happen in that.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Definitely. Give me one sec. I mean, I'm just going to show, you have all the liberty to, you know, try out yourself as well. You shouldn't be waiting like for anyone. If you want to try something out and explore what you need to do is say you're exploring this and you don't have me with you. You can always reach out to like, you know, these are the two options that are most helpful from the settings panel. And yeah, instant chat support. You can just go in and start typing in your query and they can always come on a call with you. You can ask them to come on a G meet with you. And if you need some help around, you know, configuring different settings that you want to. Do. You always have like them working 24 seven like at your service and they have like five minutes turnaround time, so that, that's all always helpful. But yeah, I mean you can do like this is something I have created… so you can do a domain and you can add a domain. You can add your logo, you can add color, which is your website colors. And then I'm not sure if I can go ahead. I have maybe, yeah, I need to give like a domain after that, I can go ahead. Yeah, let me just quickly see. I mean, yeah, after you basically do changes here, you would move into this page and then this page. So for me, I have set up something like this like raise the ticket and where anyone can add a subject, give a description of the issue and like submit the ticket after adding an attachment that's optional. Like this is something I created. I can add more fields.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Okay. That's great. I wonder too with the integrations into other systems, you know, quickbooks is one that we use regularly as well. Is there any sort of integration with the patient portal and quickbooks as well. So like, we can show them, you know, a copy of an invoice, that was paid, things like that, what?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Did you say again with quickbooks and?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  And the patient or, the portal here, the client portal, I wonder if there's integration between those systems. And can we have those third party apps sharing information through the client portal?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Okay. But if I may answer the first part which is quickbook integration is possible or not? Yes, it is, I have other customers as well that use quickbooks integration. Again, it entirely depends on what use case you have. What usually the process looks like is I get my integrations specialist on the call and we discuss all the possibilities like, hey, I want to do this with the integration or I want to achieve this, you would know what possibilities are there and what limitations you have with like the like, when the integration specialist is on the call, I can definitely check this for you. What you just mentioned. If you need to have the patient portal details and the quickbook integration and work like work it out like simultaneously, that is something I'm definitely going to check and keep you posted on it. But yeah, like to give you a quick overview, like about this like the customer portal that I mentioned about that is something you can always insert in every email. Like you get an option of like inserting this link as of like in like every email. So this is an email I was going to respond to. I would get an option of insert customer portal like this. And like again, like my portal is not active, but if it was active, I could just like insert it here. So, yes, I would definitely check on that and let you know.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Yeah, that would be great if it's if it is possible to have a specialist on our next call. That does for quickbooks online. I think that would be really helpful.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Definitely. The only limitation there is, you know, the like the integration specialist, they work out of Indian timings.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  So they would until like early PST hours. So I'll try to schedule something and I'll try to coordinate the time with you. Might be, it's not the same call. Might be, it'll be like another call but like, yeah, we can do it on the same day but might be it'll be a separate call where it's happening like really?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Early? Okay. No, that's great. I appreciate you just looking into that. Yeah.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. All right. Then if we are good with the quick overview, then, I would just love to know about like you, what setup you're looking at, what's the team that's going to use? Yeah, and what's the volume of emails that you guys receive on a day to day level? Yeah.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Generally, we probably receive somewhere between 75 to 150 emails each day. These are, we are essentially a health care company and we're coordinating care for surgical patients. We do that with a number of parties. We are… working directly with the benefit manager who's referring these patients to us, sending us copies of their records. And I was dearly thinking that we could have… a client portal for those parties, upload these records to us and then see the status of care as we're moving forward. I think that would involve a couple of custom fields which I know are really easy to set up in there, you know, what is the patient's date of surgery, their pre op date… just basic care items like that. From there, once we receive these referrals, we're sending them on to the providers themselves. So they are keeping us informed of the patient's work, that if there's any additional documentation that they may need, the dates of service for that patient's care, and the surgical plan. And generally all of that is sent over on some forms that we've created internally. I think that there's an opportunity for us to add a quick dropdown so they can see what has been sent. What are we still waiting on? Things like that? I think that's something that I'd like to explore in the future… after the date of service or sorry, as that patient's surgery is coming up, we're also advising all of the parties involved what that date of service is, and that we're the coverage so that's going to be our pathology partners, our anesthesia partners, the facilities themselves just sending them all some sort of automated update saying here's our patient here's what's happening here's, the date of service. And I think there's a lot of really great automation email tools. So we can figure that out as well post surgery. We also need to send an explanation of payment to each of these parties that's involved in the episode of care. So it would be really great to have some integration with quickbooks online where we can either automatically send out notification to each of these parties as those payments are going out, or yeah just have a good workflow within our email system to see who's been advised and when that's gone out.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. No, I hear you. And I think you also have the AI bucket with you. So there's a lot of things that I can also think of with respect to automating on the AI front like picking up different information from the body of the email and then trying to do different other tasks that we can look at doing like maybe automating a lot of things. So yeah, we will need to, you know, get more into it, try different things and see what's working the best. But yeah, makes sense. I'm just curious when you receive all of these emails, how does your team pick it up? Like is it anyone picks up anything and they work? Or like it's some person who's doing only pathologies or like how does it work?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  So Erica is primarily the one that is coordinating everything up until the date of surgery for these patients. So she's handling the bulk of this communication. I'm supporting her in that. So if there are questions along the way, you know, her and I are kind of working hand in hand and in making sure that all of that's resolved as these patients go through… once a date of surgery is set, Justin needs to be notified. And the additional person that is coming in on Monday is going to need a notification of that so that they can plan financially for these patients and then post surgery. All of that would go to probably this RCM person that's coming on Monday, they can handle the billing aspects of that. Okay?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  So, I think it's majority of like a process based, you know, workflow where until this, we are the ones who's going to manage like it's going to be managed by like us three or us two. And then post this. It's it's these three people that are going to manage it. It's that. Okay, perfect. So do you have any ideas around tags or you think you're going to go for like an a workflow level tag or like any categories? Like how, what have you thought about it? Like?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  I do think workflow like status tags is probably a great way for us to be organizing that in the future. It's not something really played around with to date. But we do have some internal tracking tools in Google sheets. And I'm not sure if there's integration with Google sheets where there could be some sort of automation when it, you know, sees something happening in a Google sheet that it would change the tags in the inbox. I think that would be an incredible tool for us to utilize if that were an option. So.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  When you say that like the changes would happen in the Google sheet and that should like do an action in the hiver platform is what you meant?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Yeah.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  No, I think we don't have like a thing where any changes that happens there would reflect here. But we do have something that is custom objects wherein if you want to set up an automation, you can insert a sheet. And right now, it's not dynamic. But the plans are to make it dynamic this year and mostly soon. So the option is like, hey, if the email is coming from xyz, do this and tag, this can be done in an automation. And then here is where you link the sheet that we are talking about and that sheet would have different data onto email addresses or different domain names. And then it can have who this email should be assigned to and a tag section as well. In fact, instead of tag, it can also have another section. And these sections can be mapped in automation as in to rows and columns saying, hey, if like this column is like triggered. Like if someone something matches with like this row, then you should assign it to something that's written in this row right beside it. And then the tag has to be applied, respective tag has to be applied. Like things like that can be done as of now. But anything that is that's changing in the sheet directly reflecting is not a capability. I wonder if I.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  see Erica just went off mute. I'm sure she has a couple of questions too, but really quickly. So currently, as emails are coming in, we're also taking notes on the current status based on these communications with different parties. I wonder if there's in that system, a potential opportunity to have summaries of this communication transferring elsewhere into that?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Sheet. OK. I think that's going to be, I wouldn't say that is automated if you're moving it out of like out of hiver to a sheet. But yeah, you do get summaries, you can paste it in the activity panel. You can do a lot of actions with that particular summary that you are like you're sort of generating.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  But right now, I mean the capabilities is not to make it like automated although the steps would be just to you just copy the summary and just paste it somewhere, but it's not automated is what I would inform you. OK?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  OK. That's helpful. Sorry, Erica, go ahead, no.

Erica Gardunio (erica.gardunio@oathsurgical.com):
  No worries. I had a quick question. So I know we've been using like status tags a little bit already and I wasn't sure. Is it possible to apply more than one tag to a given kind of like email thread?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yes, you can. OK. So I.

Erica Gardunio (erica.gardunio@oathsurgical.com):
  think a really good idea for another way that we could use status tags and Jordan feel free to shoot this down or double tap if you'd like it.

Erica Gardunio (erica.gardunio@oathsurgical.com):
  But, you know, when we send out a request for an update and we don't hear back, maybe like an auto tag to follow up in two days and then maybe like that tag triggers it like popping back up, you know, how Google kind of automates, like you haven't heard back from this person? Like do you want to follow up? Yeah?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  And if I may just add, you can also do things like, hey, if you've not heard back for like these many hours, send an automated response, you can also do that like you can automatically like type in an email which is in the automation. You'll set that up. You can also do like a lot of edits there, and then keep it like save it. And once that's triggered, it basically sends out an automated response. And you would also be notified like there's a lot of action items that you can do.

Erica Gardunio (erica.gardunio@oathsurgical.com):
  Awesome. Okay. Yeah.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. Like this is something we are going to like dwell more like we'll do like a deep dive of all of this in like our next call, it usually is like our long call where we sit down, we discuss each features and what's a possibility. Like today, whatever I'm taking down from you, with respect to your workflow, I sort of make some suggestions and I have some things in my mind. I do some brainstorming and the next call it's us both. You can be like, hey, I think tags can be used like this, custom fields can be used like this. And I can be like, yeah, this makes more sense because this will do this. It's going to be, you know, more helpful while we're setting it up and we'll have more idea, but I'm glad these questions are popping up. Okay with that. Said, I would also want to understand how have you thought of using the custom fields? Like right now? I think you mentioned custom fields Jordan, how are you looking to use it?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Yeah. On the client portal side, I essentially am thinking about this as like a checklist like there's certain documentation that we need along the way and having that just added into the chat and, you know, checking a box saying, you know, we've received this form with this information. That is kind of my thought. If there's triggers to add those in, that would be really interesting for us to use. And I think… probably the best exercise… on our end is for Erica and I to just put together kind of a wish list for like step by step, how we're going through our workflow and things that would be helpful there. And so we can just run through that list on our next call if that makes sense to you. Yeah.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. That's going to be really great. And to answer your question, custom fields, there are two ways to look at it. Like, the first thing you can do is when you have like when one of your user is opening and like, okay, this body says xyz is fulfilled. And I'll go and put that as, yes. When I do, yes. Anything that has to do with like the, yes, if we have set up an automation that says, whenever this particular checklist goes, yes, assign this to Jordan that can be done. Yeah, that is something that can be done, but someone has to like when it's talking about custom fields, someone has to manually like choose it. But when it's tagged, that can be automated, saying the AI is like, we can give prompts to AI saying, hey, whenever the subject says this and the body says this, and if this is fulfilled, tag it as requirements done or something like that. And it automatically starts doing it. And you obviously train it with like the first 10 emails, first 20 emails, you can remove and add more emails into the learning data, and you basically train the AI. And now the AI, what it does is automatically starts tagging. And then once that is tagged, there is also an automation that's triggered saying, hey, you know, medical requirements are done. So now it's moved to say, Justin to do a thing. Yeah. Like that's the flow that you can look at. Okay. So I just have a few last few points before we wind up, which is like the slas like the SLA piece that I want to speak about. Do you think SLA is something you are going to turn it on right now?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Sorry, one more time. Okay?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Slas are service level agreements as in, if you receive an email, it has to be answered like the first response has to be done within first four hours or first five hours, and the resolution has to be provided within 24 hours or 48 hours depending on business requirements. Hiver provides you option to do it generic for all emails saying, hey, anytime any email comes in, any of the users pick it up, picks it up. They have to sort of provide a first response within five hours or six hours depending on whatever you're choosing. And the resolution has to be provided within 48 or like 72 hours that's something you can set up or else you can do a SLA based on a tag which says, hey, say you are looking at a certain process and that particular process, if you are setting up an SLA whenever that process is triggered or that tag is triggered, the SLA time is different, saying, whenever you, anything is marked urgent that has to be done within two hours and the resolution has to be provided within four hours.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Something like that. Basically, people will get notifications saying, hey, you know, your first response time is due. You should respond things like that.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Yeah. We did. I did remove it, from our system and I think that was, each of our communications are just a little bit different in how we need to respond and the timeliness of them. I think we can utilize those and probably just need to work a little bit more internally on what the parameters would be on that.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, makes sense. Okay? And a last few questions. Yeah, I think knowledge base is something I wanted to know about. You think right now, you have any knowledge base that you want to put into hiver and see like whenever you can email, you basically get response suggestions based on that email. If you have knowledge bases, it will basically be different snippets from your website terms and condition. It can also be frequently asked questions. All of those docs put into like a knowledge base where AI is added to it. And now AI is basically helping you respond to like different emails that you receive.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Yeah. I think Erica, you've put together a number of training materials. Is that right? I think I've seen those, in the Google drive?

Erica Gardunio (erica.gardunio@oathsurgical.com):
  Sorry, I was multitasking training materials for just.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Like process documentation. Is that right?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  A little bit?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  I'm happy to go through kind of what we do have I put together some but it's been, it's probably been a couple of years now since I've updated it. So it would probably be good to go through and just do some cleanup internally too before uploading any of that. But are you able to show me where we would upload that? To be able to utilize that? Yeah?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  I will show you and just to like just to let you know that what we can do is we can do like phase wise implementation. So need not like all the features need not be turned on the first go. We can look at like what is priority for you guys? And say two or three things are priority. We can get started with that. And as we move ahead with like different months cadence call, we can set up more and more things so that people are also not feeling that, hey, we have everything turned on. So what we use, like they shouldn't be feeling, that is what I feel. So I'm going to show you where that is for you to explore. But, yeah, I mean, no pressure. We can definitely, you know, enable things as we go on. Just give me a quick second. Yeah, this is any, which way is the last part which brings us to if you have any questions, do, let me know, but I'll just show you where the, yeah right here. Okay. I just.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  So under AI, if you come into like this admin panel side and you're coming into AI, these are the AI options available to you. And this is where I was talking about like knowledge sources. So you can add notion docs, you can add like different, you know, snippets and documents right here and you can like enable it to use different like you can enable it for the shared mailbox. And then you would have like one logo like this how it's loom is showing up. I don't know why it's not showing up for me but it's like a thing that shows up right here which says hiver AI and you click on it and it will open the hiver AI for you.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Let me just go back to my main screen and see if it's popping up. But yeah, it usually pops up right here. But yeah, with that, I think we are pretty much done with all the questions. I will just follow up with you to know, you know, like if the same time next Wednesday works fine for our next call and you let me know and we should have next call before that, I'll also coordinate with the integration specialist and schedule a call for the quickbook integration discussion. Okay?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Okay.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  So, before we like before we sign off, I think Raghav, I would just like to introduce Raghav. I was mentioning about him, he was on a call and he just joined in. So pass it, pass on to you, Raghav.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thanks for that, Sonali. Hey folks. Apologies for the tardiness. It's been a bit of a hectic day for me with back to back meetings, quick introductions. I'm going to be working and partnering with Sonali as the account manager. I currently take care of our account management team here at hiver. I've been with the hiver business for about eight years now. So excited to hear all the old surgical team would love to, is looking to explore and leverage hiver especially with all of the AI functionalities that you've signed up for as well. We're pretty excited to get the basic structure in place and progressively make hiver make do more for your team that's.

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  great. Thank you so much. And I appreciate you jumping on and understand, how busy the day gets.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  For sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, yeah, pleasure meeting everybody. And I think on that note that's also goodbye for today. Excited to continue collaborating. Sonali is still going to run primary communication with your team for the immediate future. I'm going to be more of a backup resource, but feel free to write back to Sonali to me as well in case there's anything you'd like to know about hiver?

Jordan Sloan (jordan.sloan@oathsurgical.com):
  Perfect. Thank you so much. Appreciate both your time.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Bye guys. Have a nice day. Take care.
