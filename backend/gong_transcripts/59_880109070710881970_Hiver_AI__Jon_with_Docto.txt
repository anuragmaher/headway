================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, John. Can you hear me?

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Got you now. Hello, Raghav. How are you? Going? Good. Thanks.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Alright, brilliant. It's been a pleasure meeting you. I'm Raghav. I'm sorry, I'm just dealing or rather still recovering from a bit of the flu. So I'm going to be video off for most part of the call. No.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Worries. I'll do the same, preserve my bandwidth, hello? Mate.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. All good. I just wanted to put a face to the name, pleasure meeting you there.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  You go. Pleasure meeting you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Alright. I'm going to reach for my box of tissues next then, John, I've been with the hiver business for like eight years. I take care of our account management motion. And for today, I'm going to be your host, walking you through the AI functionality on hiver and exploring how any or all of them could be useful for your team. Yeah, brilliant. So, yeah, John, heading into today's, discussion, I've noticed that you were specifically interested in the tagging and the co pilot piece. So my first question to kick things off is have you had a chance to check them out? Have you been using them for a bit?

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  No, no. We haven't is it live? Yeah, I'm not quite sure what it is yet. Alright. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries. And John, could you maybe just give me like a 30 second overview in terms of how you're using hiver as of today?

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Yeah. So we've got an admin team of about five, I think five or so and they've… managed the inbound emails from hiver… we're a medical clinic, basically a telehealth medical service.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Alright. That makes sense. Now. I noticed that you've got an admin and an accounts inbox. So when you say admin, would I be right in assuming that this is basically like front office?

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Yes, exactly. Front office.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Alright. Makes sense. Okay, perfect. And so, you know, with regards to how you're using hiver, you know, outside the co pilot, what kind of tags do you run? Or what kind of categories do you have or would like to have?

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Well, we have customers who are patients or customers who are companies, and they'll often email in with different types of inquiries in particular, things like, can I book an appointment or can I cancel one? Or can the doctor do this or that? Or I didn't receive my prescription or I, my report is incorrect? Can you change it? That sort of thing or sometimes receipts or questions about invoices, you know, for the accounts inbox. Yeah, that sort of stuff.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Alright. Understood. Well, hey John, that gives me a quick brief overview. I did have a chance to, you know, check out your website, take a little bit of understanding in terms of what docto does as a business as well. And so would I also be right in assuming that for the accounts inbox, it's going to be more along the lines of payments, you know, primarily from like healthcare providers, I'm guessing, but also from businesses and individuals in terms of, you know, subscription done for like the 79 dollar one that you have or like things along those fronts.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Or it'll be us chasing up payments and people saying, but we didn't do that or we did do this or can you change it to that? So basically invoice and billing management from the accounts inbox, and in the admin inbox, it's all inquiries also like do you do this? Can you provide that service? What are your waiting times etc?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Understood. All right. That gives me a good overview. Thanks for that. So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to do a little bit of show and tell hope you can see my inbox so I can walk you through the AI pieces. Yeah, brilliant. All right. John. So with the hiver AI piece or like the AI feature add on that we've got, we're effectively looking at approaching the AI developments in hiver on two broad categories, right? One is from an agentic route. And what we call AI agents on hiver are going to be features that would help your team operationally be more efficient in inbox management, right? It could be automating stuff that your emails that you receive. It could be automatically categorizing them. And that's effectively how the AI agent category would be continuously built out and developed. The AI co pilot on the other hand is more of an AI assistant for your teams. And this is going to be more from the perspective of helping your team answer questions immediately, you know, take care of responses faster. So the co pilot is more on the lines of information that goes out to your clients, to your vendors and everybody else. Agents on the other hand is going to be more for internal efficiency and operational excellence there. So to dig deeper into both of those, I'm going to pick one of my inboxes and sort of give you an overview. So we've got three main AI features that are out and have been adopted. We've had a lot of success with all of our customers and the agents front. Those comprise of the tagging, the sentiment analysis and the thank you detector. Now, the thank you detector starting from the bottom is pretty straightforward, right? You get emails if it resonates with a thank you sentiment basically meaning nobody needs to do anything except close it. Hiver is just going to basically automatically close it. It's as simple and as straightforward as that. Now the place where you start seeing additional AI intelligence happening and AI in itself is that starts with the AI tagging. Now so far with hiver, everybody's been used to a workflow based tagging mechanism where like you said before, if an email comes in, it's got the word prescription. It's got the word bill. It's got the word medical certificate, add a certain tag to it. And that's how you've been categorizing it all this while. Now, with AI tagging taking the front, you get a more… generalistic a white brush approach if I can call it that a broad stroke approach where basically, you know, the hiver's. AI model would be able to categorize emails based on a multitude of factors. So to talk about that in more detail, firstly, the way it works is you give hiver a bunch of tags that it needs to be trained on. And because it's AI, just like how you'd onboard a new member in the team, you've got to give the AI clear or I wouldn't say clear, but at least a generalistic sense of how you'd want it to categorize emails or in this case, add a tag. So what you'd effectively do is select a bunch of tags that you want to train the AI on and start by feeding it email conversations. So if you notice in this case, AI would be able to pretty much import emails or on the alternative, your team can pretty much go into your inbox pass or present emails, doesn't make a difference and give it. So 10 email conversations that you feel match a certain criteria. Now, you know, for example, if you're talking about a cancellation request, there could be a multitude of ways in which people say, I want to cancel this appointment that I've got, I want to cancel my online consultation, right? They'd be like, hey, I'm sick. Can't make it to the consultation? I want to reschedule any of these words. Now, the problem was trying to do this over a workflow builder or an automation is that you can't always cover all the phrases and the terms people might use. So that's where AI takes the lead, right? It's going to be able to, based on your training, have that understanding of how the people that you interact with or email into your inquiries inbox right on the admin front, give it as varied as examples, you know, in terms of 10. And the moment you give it 10 examples that's you completing the training. And then from there, AI on hiver would pretty much take over. First thing it's going to do is going to craft a neat little prompt which you can then further refine and categorize I mean, further refine and make better as well. If you'd want to. And this prompt would kind of act as the baseline based on which this particular category is attached to emails. All you need to do is again just give it 10 emails. So the AI model knows what you define as a cancellation and what's the breadth and scope of it, get it ready. And then once it's done, turn it on and it's going to start automatically adding this tag to every email that you receive as long. As it matches the condition and it doesn't just stop there, right? With the automations, you can also perform actions based on a certain category. So if that's not something you've explored so far, you can do things like if somebody sends in a request to book an appointment, and that appointment is for a certain type, like let's say a medical certificate, you can have an automation assign it to a person in the team who's probably in charge of it, mark it as high or low priority depending on again, a few factors, right? And you could even have a template of response just going out to medical certificate inquiries instead of the standard message that people usually have. These are some examples where automations and the AI tagging go hand in hand and create that full picture for operational stuff there. The AI sentiment analysis on the other hand is going to be more on again a perspective where your team can have an understanding of the type of tonality and the kind of interactions that they're going to be having or expect to have when they open an email, there's a difference between a three and a five point scale that you can choose from. Essentially it's going to look for verbiage tonality, phrasing, and if there's conversations existing on that email chain, just what's the password been like? It's going to be more of an ongoing process. There's a mechanism and it's going to look something like this where once it's enabled it's going to tell you, hey, this one's called neutral sentiment, right? Because they've just been like straightforward it's like contracted to stash, please review that's about it. On the other hand, if somebody gives you like really good emotions, like I had a quick question about the hiver plan. I was hoping someone could walk me through the details thanks a bunch that's usually an indication that they're coming in from a good space basically meaning that your team can pretty much jump on it and get the thing done. Now with the sentiment first, it's going to be more of an ongoing metric or like an ongoing measurement which means if some conversations start off on a negative connotation, but through the interactions your team has, they convert it to a positive connotation, those would all be things that you can start tracking in the long run. I probably see this being a little useful in the admin inbox. Not entirely sure about the accounting inbox outside of maybe, hey, I've been following up for five days for a refund for a correction on my invoice. I haven't gotten that. Those are places where with an accounting sentiment could be useful with an admin. It could be again on a similar note of, hey, I had the greatest time scheduling a session with you all for the admin team. Thank you so much for that. That could be a good sentiment and a good marker there. Now, just like with the tags, even the sentiment outcomes could be used to trigger additional follow throughs and closing the loops. For instance, if somebody comes in as a negative or a very negative sentiment, you can have an automated email going out again that says, hey, we're sorry, you're not having the best experience with us. I'm the person in charge. Feel free to write back to me directly or something along those lines, right? So that's essentially like a quick overview. In terms of the tagging piece. The tags will show up here. In terms of the regular experience. There's going to be a little sparkle icon if it's added by AI. And there's also going to be a note activity log specifically that says hiver, AI added the tag, hiver, AI updated the sentiment and so on and so forth. So that's the tagging piece and the sentiment piece in terms of how they work in everyday scenarios, just going to take a quick pause before I jump to the next bit.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Okay. But it doesn't automatically send. I can't imagine there's ever an email we want to get where we're going to send an automated response back. We'll always want to consider what the actual is saying.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. Definitely.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Does it just suggest a response and wait for you to approve it?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's a great question. So that's where the co pilot piece comes in. So this is more operational in terms of understanding the kind of conversations you're handling the co pilot piece sits right in here. That little sparkle button again. And what it does is current state is going to help your team members do two things. One is if you're a new person and somebody's reassigning a conversation to you and you're not sure. Hey, where do I begin? You can have the co pilot quickly run a summary, tell you. Hey, this is the text in the conversation, right? That's the summary, a quick tldr, and then it's also going to give you a very specific information there experience of the issue, the actions taken so far, the current status and potential next steps that might be needed. Now, how is the AI able to give you potential next steps? Well, that's where the co pilot has an additional advantage. Not only do you again, just like with any AI, you'll start by training it, but with the ask AI or the co pilot, you get a bigger scope of training it. Now, as an admin team in a business, I'm sure you have a lot of processes, you know, when it comes to refunds, when it comes to rescheduling a booking appointment, when it comes to changing the type of booking, they've done any and all of those stuff, you can feed all of those either as a knowledge base in hiver, store them as internal articles or just upload them as files as you have them PDFS, word, documents, text files, all of those are supported. And if you just have smaller texts, right? Stuff that's not big enough to warrant an article on and off itself. But it's good enough that it needs to be there for the team. You can even add those as short form snippets as well. So essentially, once you've got all of these knowledge sources fed and, you know, connected with the hiver AI piece, what it can do is basically help your team members draft the reply. Like you asked for, right? You can be like, all right, I've got this email. I'm an agent in the team. I go into admin. I see an email. I see draft a reply. Now, as long as the AI has these relevant knowledge sources attached to it, you can basically as an agent give it what you'd like for it to do request additional details, offer suggestions, provide status based on your input. It's going to go through your knowledge sources, process documents and everything and then suggest the best answer that you need. To go out, I,

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  like that. I like that a lot.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. There you go. If you feel this is good insert, ready to go review, send it out. If you feel this is not better rewrite with better verbiage, for instance, you know, the usual stuff, right? Make it better, make it professional, look up the information again, go through the process document again, check this piece within that. It becomes a little more conversational in that sense and you can keep asking it questions back and forth till you have the perfect answer. Now, this is the current version. And in the next couple of months, we're going to have AI be able to give you that response, right on the email thread as a suggestion. So you don't even have to go here and do this conversation part back and forth. It will be able to give you that little like a shared draft on hiver that we have basically something along these lines. You know, they'll have that stored here and your team when they open it as an agent, they'll see an AI suggested response that they can see, approve, edit and send out when ready.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Right now, can you just tell me where I put the I'm just in hiver? Now, on my other screen, where do I add the knowledge base?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. Sure. Can you go to your hiver admin panel?

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. And you've got, go to hiver, AI. Yeah. All right. Go to copilot. Yeah. And then knowledge sources, the one thing you need to remember is make sure you select the right inbox, because you've got two of those, right? So top right, select the correct one, knowledge.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Source. Oh, okay. It's toggled off that's why knowledge sources train AI on knowledge base to help agent find information, knowledge source.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So there's two perspectives. Sorry. Yeah, John, go ahead.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  It can be that's okay. And it can be any document, PDF.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  PDF, text word, docx. All of those are supported.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Okay. Nice. Okay. I'll definitely have a little play around with, that looks really interesting.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. And the other piece that I said about the hiver knowledge base, right? That's you building out these article sets on a hiver faq space, right? You've got a feature on hiver, that lets you build out a knowledge base as is. So if you've got information on multiple documents, you can just quickly copy, paste it on hiver's knowledge base and that then becomes a central repository meaning any updates down the line, you just need to update it on a single document on hiver as opposed to re, uploading changing and doing a bunch of things like that.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Sorry, show me that again, where's the single document?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Go to knowledge base here. And then I mean, you should see this option here on the left side, same place as my screen.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And then you say create new knowledge base and it's going to be.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It's been a while since I logged into this. It's going to essentially give you an option to create this as is, did you get that?

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Yeah, that's really interesting. And so that knowledge base can also be the source.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  the proposed responses, really interesting.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So it's going to look like this. You can create articles, put it under categories, have like an author, the whole shebang, right? Category and all of that.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Great. Fantastic.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So as it stands right now, these are the three main or pretty useful elements of the AI piece on hiver. As an add on. There is a fourth, a little more nuance to feature as well with an AI, and that's from a workflow perspective, right? So, considering there's an accounting inbox and an admin inbox, I'm sure there's few pieces that are relevant to your team's, interactions with customers. Now, those could be invoice numbers. Those could be consultation numbers, booking ids, reference ids, anything on those fronts. And what you can also do is create while you're creating a workflow on hiver, use another element of AI here that would let you extract that data as you would have expected. It's called the AI extract. And what you can do is select specific elements that you'd like to extract and surface within a certain custom field or a certain type on hiver, like a certain field on the right side. So it pops out when your team sees that conversation. Now, in my case, if that's an invoice id, I want to track, I'm going to give it, hey, my general invoice numbers or nomenclature. There is going to be inv, four digits… you know, another few digits and effectively the same logic, right? Train it initially. So it knows what the best way to go about doing it is. And as an outcome, you can have the AI update that number in a certain space. So this is a sample workflow that we've built out for that where we said, hey, the subject contains any of these terms or the body contains, you know, the same set of terms. Then I want hiver to extract the invoice number for the body or subject and attach it as a note within that conversation. So that way whenever somebody opens that email and we know they're going to go looking for that invoice number or booking id. It's right there on the note and it can be easily surfaced for the team to have an understanding of what that looks like.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Yeah. Right. Okay. Smaller piece.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So as of now, these are the four major elements of hiver that are both from an internal operational efficiency and from a getting reply out perspective. Over the next two weeks, we're also going to be launching something called the hiver quality analysis. What that's going to let your team do is effectively oops, sorry, I'm just going to try to see if I have a prototype of that ready that I can show you. But effectively, what that will let you do is allow you to make it easier for your team when they're typing out or composing replies, right? And as a business owner and as a team leader, you'll also be able to track the outcomes of that as well. So, for example, you know, when I've got this email here, oops, I'm just going to, yeah, there we go. So you can be like aiqa is what we're calling it and what it would do is as an agent in the team, I no longer have to even worry about how I'm typing something. I can just type something like I'm texting somebody, and I can then ask the QA perspective like the QA hiver to be like make it professional, add some greetings becomes a ready message, ready to go, right? And this works on composing a new email, composing a reply. And on an admin perspective, you're also going to be able to have the settings that you can configure where you're like, hey, I want aiqa to evaluate greetings, spelling, tonality, clarity, completeness and personalization, depending on your preference. And in all of these perspectives, you will be able to configure examples. And you'll also be able to, you know, have the AI give you that rating. So that way, long term, the way this will work is when you're running a report, you're going to be able to understand your scoring of your team members, how many of them were able to, with the assistance of AI, have a great message going out, what's their performance? Like what was that reporting like this week? Was it better than last week better than the previous week? You get all of that details here. So whichever is relevant and important to, you could pretty much have that tracked as well. So this one's interesting next two weeks, yeah.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Yeah, great. Okay. Well, look, that gives me heaps of stuff to have a little flit around. And now there's an increased cost. Is there a free trial here? Raghav?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So there is a free trial for right now. We've got the free trial cutting over on the XV of November which is basically one week from now. What I've usually seen from the customers we've enabled us in the past is five days is usually sufficient time to understand the tagging and the co pilot PC. If it makes sense if, you know, if sentiment isn't of interest, and what I'd like to offer you instead is a two week trial, right? I'll give you time till like the twentieth, basically two weeks from now 20 20 first and in terms of costs, so that hopefully gives you sufficient time, you know, I'd love to keep the communication open. So any questions, doubts as you explore it, feel free to write them back to me. I'll be able to like help you out or put you in touch with the right person who can give you that clarity on the pricing front. The entire AI add on suite is at a 20 dollar per user per month paid add on over and above any subscription tier that you've got. So you've got the tasks suggested response and answers as three main things that are going to be releasing within the next couple of months as well, right? All of this usage per feature, like, you know, you can use as many summarizers, you can do as many replies as you want with ask AI. So all of that at a single 20 dollar per user per month, add on perspective, right? So on the communication front that's what that looks like. So John, I think I'll leave you with that for right now. I know you've got a lot of stuff you want to test out.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let me see your doubt in email with a recording of this message with some of our help articles and click through, you know, guiders so that you can have an idea of how to go about it while you're exploring, write back to me if you have any questions and what I'll do, John, do you think it's okay if we schedule like a quick 15 minute check in call, maybe, you know, the week of the October seventeenth? I'm thinking, yeah, sounds.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Good. Yeah. Let's hook up then. Sounds good?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sorry. Did any preference on time before I let you go?

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  I'll be back in Australia then. So I'll just have to probably mid morning is a good time for me Australia time.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Australia, Sydney, cranborough,

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  might not be so good for you if you're in London, but I can do, I can do sort of evening. So it's early morning, London time for you?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no. On the side note, I actually work Eastern Time zones. So, I covered like the us time zones. So if you're in Australian time and, you know, like if you tell me which time zone you're in? Like is it Perth? Adelaide? I mean, Adelaide, Brisbane. Alright. Perfect. Okay. Just give me a minute, Brisbane. Okay. Alright. What does the nine am Brisbane time convert to? Oh, we can do nine am on the nineteenth or twentieth or any time between nine to 11, should be good for me.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  Great. Let's make it 10.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  10 am Brisbane time, nineteenth works. Great. Brilliant. Alright, John. Thank you so much for your time today.

Jon Field (jon@docto.com):
  No worries. Thanks. Great stuff. Thanks, Ajit.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Cheers, John. Have a good day. Bye bye.
