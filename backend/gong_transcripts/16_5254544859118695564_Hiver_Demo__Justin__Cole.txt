Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on Justin?

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Hey, good morning. How are you? I'm.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  good. I'm good. How are you?

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  I'm all right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice. I appreciate you hopping on the call here today. Where are you based? Out of?

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  I'm in North Carolina.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Very cool. I'm based out of New York.

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Oh, nice.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I appreciate you hopping on the call here today, Justin. So just to set a quick agenda, we'd love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role, what got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions sure, but I can introduce myself first just to kick us off.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So my name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the customer service space for a little over seven years now. And yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can potentially help you all today? Great?

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Yes, I'm with key autism services. I've been with them for about eight years. We provide Aba and home therapy for children with mental health issues, autism mostly. And we work out of we're in eight, nine states at the moment. So, yeah, I'm kind of just looking for a help desk solution. Currently, we are using Monday. Com and we kind of built our own workflow in there and created our own automations using third party software. And it's a bit of a mess. We're also looking to get off that platform as we move into a new practice management software for next year. So we're kind of just looking for a new help desk solution. We're looking for something relatively simple. We basically, we just want to have a form that people would have access to. We can send them a link. They can get access to a form. They fill out the form. It would have some different dropdowns based on what's selected, some conditional things. And then once the form's submitted, it would just be moved to the correct people so that they could take care of the issue and then kind of go back and forth from there. So, I think what we're looking for is a pretty simple solution. I'm just not sure how it works in your system got.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It. So you're really just looking for like a portal where people can log into and submit tickets and submit forms? Or would it be like a form that's on your website that people just like click submit? And then it gets routed accordingly.

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Yes. I mean, probably something closer to that. So in the way it works in Monday, the way we're doing it right now is we can create a form in Monday and then we can just get a link for that form to give external users access to it. We're not looking to have everyone in the company having access to the system. We have, our back office is about 30 people and field workers. We have over 1,200. So we're just looking to give only the people who would need access to the system, access to the system. And everyone else would either submit this through. We could host it on our website. I don't think that would really be an issue or access to like an external form that would then feed into the system and kind of create those tickets and route them where they need to go.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right, right. And just to understand… further, how many people would it be? The back office folks that are mainly using a system like this? Like how many people? Okay.

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Yeah. I mean it would be 25 people at most.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And is it, do you provide any email customer service where like people reach out to a general query inbox or is it primarily just forms you're looking to drive the engagement?

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Primarily forms? Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Gotcha. So right now, we don't have robust form capabilities. And are you Gmail or outlook just curious?

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Outlook?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Outlook. Okay. So right now, we don't have robust capabilities within our Omni product yet for forms that is something that is being developed currently… but it's not currently released yet. Right now, the best we can do from like a form submission is we have like this customer portal Justin where we can like, you know, this can be hosted on your website. And then you can see top right? You just have like submit the issue and then this can be sent, you know, for tracking purposes within hiver. Okay. And then once you know, we fill out this form and it gets submitted, we're then able to track it and it sends it into our platform into like an email type format to track and work through that, you know, specific ticket itself. So when you go into the support inbox, right? I'll click on, you know, the unassigned here. Actually, I'll go into the mine because that was not a good example. So this is, you know, the email format that it would come in and route based on like subject line, body of text, things of that nature to track this specific form submission and do things like assign it to users, you know, track the status, whether it's open pending or closed, you know, adding tags for organizational purposes and things of that nature.

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, you know, we can route just based on manually doing it, but we can also do it like, you know, with keywords in the subject line, keywords, the body of text, we can also do it based on the domains that are specifically reaching out. So, you know, if certain people on your team have certain skills or knowledge sets, we can create those rules. So the right people are kind of getting the right things.

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Got it. And if the form hosted on the website, can it have conditional elements? Like, I mean if we're looking to let's say because we're in different states, too, right? So we have people submitting a particular issue which we would want issue types, kind of in a dropdown more so than just a text field for subject. I mean, even with what we have now where people can't submit things tickets correctly. So they kind of get routed to the wrong place all the time and we're looking to kind of fix those issues. So we want to have something where they're not just typing in something in a subject line, but they are selecting from a dropdown. And then that will kind of drive where the ticket goes 100.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Percent, that makes total sense. Just kind of like forcing them to select the correct option versus like, yeah, there's just a lot of room for human error in that other way. Okay? So not currently, that is something that's on our roadmap. So I think maybe and it sounds like that's like an absolute must have from your perspective. But what we do also do Justin like we will build this for our clients. So this is something where like if this is a specific feature where you want these conditional forms, we can expedite it for, you know, create, you know, have you be able to like test it to make sure it's a fit. And then if it is, we can, you know, move forward with a potential relationship. So I think for a next step because like since it's not currently able to be showcased, say it is on our near term roadmap, let me meet with my engineering team to understand because it's supposed to come out within like the next month or maybe month or two. So let me reconnect with them to understand what these timelines are. Once we have that understood, we can kind of re, engage this conversation and go from there. Yeah.

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Sounds good. Yeah, we're not. So we're looking to move over to this new practice management software in the next. Probably I'd say four to six months, okay? As a realistic timeframe. So, I mean if this is something that's implemented by the time we're ready to move off of Monday, which would be around that time, then definitely something we can look into, oh.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's perfect. And that's actually, it'll 100 percent be released by then. Yeah. So when would be, so I think you said it's four to six months. So is that when the contract is up with Monday?

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  So, unfortunately, our contract is up in February with Monday. So we'll be renewing for the year regardless we have, aside from the help desk piece, we have a lot of our workflows and things in Monday. Com. But the new practice management we'll be moving or we're looking to move to is going to be in the new system. So we're pretty much signing off with Monday for another year regardless, right? I mean, as far as contract wise, it doesn't really matter because we're going to have to sign a year with them anyway because we can't lose access to it. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, that makes sense. So when would be a good time to touch base with you to kind of restrike this conversation when the timing is better?

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  I mean, honestly, once you can let me know of a timeframe and kind of give me a little bit of a look at what it's going to look like, with having conditionals and forms and that sort of thing, you know, as soon as possible, even if we can move over to something before we're ready to go in the new PM software off to get, you know, support taking off Monday, we're fine with moving over earlier. Yeah, I mean, it's as soon as you have the info for me. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Why don't we schedule something for like the 20 first of January so I can like, you know, touch base with my team and then I'll have like a better idea of what this looks like.

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Yeah, that would work. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So I'll just send over this invite first same time on the 20 first.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then I'll start doing my due diligence to understand those concrete timelines and we'll have, you know, hopefully something to showcase by then.

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Yeah, sounds great. All.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Perfect. Well, that was, great to meet. You. Let me know if there's any other questions in the meantime and we will talk soon.

Justin Freeman (justin.freeman@keyautismservices.com):
  Absolutely. Sounds great. Thanks so much.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Bye, Justin. Bye.
