  hi, Nick?

Nick M:
  Hello, youkta.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hello?

Nick M:
  Good. Thank you yourself.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Good, good. Doing well. Thank you.

Nick M:
  Just a moment. I'm waiting for some of my team members to join me. I think one has forgotten about it. I've just been travelling as I mentioned, I just got back last night. So things are a little bit of a mess here. Just a second.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all.

Nick M:
  Where can we see participants?

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm here, ah.

Nick M:
  Mian. Yeah, there you are. I can't hear you properly, Mie?

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Yeah. Can you hear me now?

Nick M:
  It's a bit difficult. Youkta can you hear Mian?

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  I can hear you but.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  There is some disturbance, I think from the background.

Nick M:
  Yeah, there's a disturbance. I'm not sure why… just try again? Mie, try talking.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Okay. Yeah, sure.

Nick M:
  I think we can hear you alright. So, I think I'm not sure if, Diana should be joining, but maybe she forgot about this. I've just come off a flight as I mentioned. So I haven't reminded the team about this meeting, but in any case, we can continue for now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. I think Diana is the only one, right? Yeah.

Nick M:
  Yeah, Diana's I think she's forgotten about this meeting.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So the agenda for today's, meeting, Nick is to give an overview to me, right? In terms of how she can use the platform, what all functionalities are there?

Nick M:
  Yep. So, I think the team's going okay with it? I don't know Mian, have you got any questions specifically?

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  No, I'm good. I actually okay, with hiver. So, yeah, I don't have any, you know, questions at all? Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you're able to use it like with the interface and all of that, are you familiar with how the tool works and everything is going fine?

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Oh, well, I think just the basic, with, you know, the emails and live chat before? So, yeah.

Nick M:
  I think Mian, why don't you show the current workflow to Yukta just so you can show how we're actually using hiver?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.

Nick M:
  If you can share your screen?

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Wait one moment.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Sorry, hold on a sec. I'm not really familiar with the MacBook. So I'm trying to.

Nick M:
  That's okay. Okay.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  All right. Okay. You can see it now?

Nick M:
  Yes.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Okay. So, yeah. So for example, there will be an incoming email address to support. It will be to an assigned folder. So if there's no assigned agent, it will be assigned to me. So I would like, you know, click this one and choose my name and then leave it open. Once I respond to that email, I'll put it on pending or close if that email is, you know, responded. So if there are emails for other team members, I'll assign it to them. And then I also use tags on emails like adding tags in here. What else? So, with status… I have to, oh, wait one second, I have to.

Nick M:
  Sorry to cut you off.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Okay. So.

Nick M:
  I just wanted to say Yukta, we've stopped using your chat because we found a decline in the number of inquiries coming from chat as opposed to our live chat system we had previously. So we actually have disabled the live chat.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  That's correct? What?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Are you using instead of live chat in hiver?

Nick M:
  We're using livechat. Com.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Is there a reason why you're using a different platform for chat?

Nick M:
  Yeah. So that it has more throughput, we're getting more chat inquiries through that system. So we were able to customize the appearance of the chat system, what's it called the pop up that's actually on the page. So we've customized it with their system. We've had that for years and it gets a lot more chats. So we were under the impression that with the hiver, live chat, we were not getting as many chats. Is that correct Mian in your experience?

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Yes, with the inquiries, for example, the customer will go to our site, live chat will normally pop up and would also chat for discount. So customer would like… they know where to message us. If there are inquiries, and like hiver, it's only a messenger… button on the page and it won't pop up until if you're going to really message the support got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It, so it doesn't automatically pop up when someone is on the site.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  That's correct?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, we'll take this as a feedback for sure. And if we are, if there's anything that I hear from the product team in terms of, if we could replicate that, I think I will let you know about that. Yeah.

Nick M:
  Like we could customize the actual chat dialogue on the site in live chat. So we've put in as Mian mentioned, it says chat now for a discount. We've had that for years and it gets a lot of inquiries. Whereas if it's just a chat icon, it doesn't with your system. It wasn't performing as well. There's other functions in live chat too, though, Mian correct? Like there's location viewing for the user.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Yes. So, if the customer message is on live chat, we know where the customer is. So, since we are shipping international, we know what or how to answer their inquiries. So that's also a big help for us.

Nick M:
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let me see if we can support these things.

Nick M:
  We're just being transparent with you because we have disabled it for that reason. So it's not as optimal for us.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, makes sense. It completely makes sense.

Nick M:
  Okay. And we've also, we've put in the integration with woocommerce. Is that working Mian? I was.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  going to ask, how is that coming along? Are you able to use it?

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Wait, which one again? I'm sorry?

Nick M:
  So, this is the one where you have an email thread and it should actually match. Maybe I've been traveling and I haven't explained it to you. I told Diana, but if you go into an email with a customer, it should match the email and then give you the order record in woocommerce.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Let me check.

Nick M:
  If you go, you see how it says view?

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Woocommerce, if they have the same.

Nick M:
  Yeah, you see how it says view woocommerce. Hold on, view, woocommerce, details on the bottom, right?

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Oh, okay. Oh, this one?

Nick M:
  Maybe I haven't explained it to you. So you haven't been checking it, oh.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Yeah. You traveled when?

Nick M:
  Yeah, I've been traveling all week, but this email should be, it should match customer emails with their records in woocommerce, should, but if you haven't been using it, we can't really report on it at this stage.

Nick M:
  Oh, there you are. So I didn't explain this one to you because you can actually directly if you click the id link, it will open the record in woocommerce. See under orders info. Yeah.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Okay.

Nick M:
  Well, that is working in any case.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Yeah.

Nick M:
  Now, we also haven't integrated the call software, Yukta, so the air call will be doing it likely next week now that I'm back in the office at home. So we'll let you know how that goes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me know if you need any help in terms of the integration, happy to loop you with the support team there.

Nick M:
  Sure. My understanding though is the dialer will just work natively within hiver and Gmail, correct?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that is correct. Okay?

Nick M:
  We'll let you know how that goes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. I think this looks good. Do you, are you also using email templates? Me like email templates is something that you could also use while you're responding to emails so that you can put all those.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  We do. Yeah, I'm sorry, Diana did created some template, but I'm not using it because it's actually the response are actually like case to case basis. Okay. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. I mean, as, and when you do feel like, you know, you could use a template, yeah, you can do that. Yeah. So that could be useful as well.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Okay.

Nick M:
  The ones that Diana shared, we needed her on this call and she's obviously forgotten about it. Yeah. Okay. Look, I think what we should do Yukta is reschedule. Once I've put air call in and I'll get Diana on this call with me and together so we can all have a look at the final system.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me know whenever you need support. I will loop in the support team for this in order for you. If you have any questions since we are already set up with the basic setup and understanding of the tool. So for any technical… query or any assistance that you require, I think the support team would be the best people to assist you from here on. So let's do this once you have, once you're ready with air call and you are doing the integration, let me know, and then we can assist you accordingly as per what you need.

Nick M:
  Let's do that next month? Because now that I think about it, we're coming into black Friday sales and I don't want to touch anything in the system at this point. It's too important in the next few weeks. So we'll do it next month. I'll let you know once it's in there and we'll set up another call.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, sounds great. Sounds great.

Nick M:
  Okay. Thanks for your time, no.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries at all. Thank you so much. Take care.

Mie Ann A (mieann.a@cpapspecials.com):
  Thank you. Bye bye.
