Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Ramesh. How are you? Hi, I'm good. How about you? Doing well. I'm so sorry for rescheduling. This is my other big run over. So where are you guys calling from? I am based in India. I'm currently in… gurgaon… how about yourself? We are in Chennai… great. Great. Hi, Divya, how are you doing?

Divya:
  Hi, Yukta. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you. How are you doing? I'm.

Divya:
  good too. Thank you so much.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Great. Shall we get started with the discussion or expecting more people to join in as well?

Divya:
  From our side, I don't think anybody will be joining, but is Hari joining from your side? Yukta?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, I'll be taking this up from here. Great. Then. Thank you so much for taking out the time to connect with us. So, my name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver and this will be your point of contact helping you with this evaluation. So, before we get into hiver, I would first want to just understand what made you look out for a tool like hiver in the market. At this point, I know you did give a brief to Hari as well in terms of better visibility, mostly handling the chats that are coming in. So if you could just brief me more as to, you know, what your current process is and what are the pain points? I think accordingly, I'll be able to assist you.

Divya:
  Sure. So as I've already briefed Hari on this, I would like to tell you this again. So we are, we currently don't have a CRM in place, but we just have a chat support right now which is called tdo. So what we are looking for is a centralized platform where our team can handle the emails and the chat support if needed, any extra integrations of if that's supported, we are looking for something that is organized and have a structured flow and which acts as a one point of contact for us to, that acts as a bridge between us and our customers.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. So, this chat channel that you're using, what does it name? You said it's.

Divya:
  called tdo.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Tdo. Got it. And like what's the split as in like do you mostly engage via chat or email also has a good?

Divya:
  Yeah, we have both. Yeah, the split is good on both emails and chat. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So chat, I'm I did go through your website. You have a whatsapp placed on your website, right? Is that the chat or do you have a separate chat option as well?

Divya:
  Okay. The website that you are looking at, you were looking at was called Rama water filters, which is our home brand. The support for which I needed is called Phoenix gravity water filters. The same Rama water filters internationally. It's called Phoenix gravity water filters. So I am looking for an international support team.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Got it. So, in terms of the emails, so, could you help me understand? Like do you have a generic email address at which you receive all support related emails or how is it?

Divya:
  Yes, we see, Yukta, there are, our brand is split across the world under the name of Phoenix gravity water filters. And we are deeply rooted in the countries like UK, us and France and we are still spanning all over the world. So for each market, we have a different email addresses.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. For each region, basically.

Divya:
  Yes, for each region, yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you have a designated team also assigned to each region or the team is same?

Divya:
  No, the team is same.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Okay. Understood. And how many regions do you have? Like how many of such email addresses you have in total?

Divya:
  For now, it is the current, we have three which acts as a primary point of contact for three regions, UK, us and France.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. UK, us and France got it. And how currently the team is handling all the email communication? Are they logging into the same Gmail account and then picking these emails distributing? Or are these like Google groups wherein they are going into everybody's respective inboxes?

Divya:
  Exactly. We are, the current Gmail is what we use for email handling.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So everybody logs into the same account and then picks these emails. Yes. But all times, if like I would have all three inboxes in front of me and I'd be just picking emails and coordinating?

Divya:
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. So, like what are the like troubles that you're facing with this workflow at this point?

Divya:
  So, the main thing that we are looking is for organization. Like it is not properly organized. There are, it is cluttered. So I just want a proper structure where I get everything in one platform. Okay? That's a major roadblock we're facing right now that's the reason we are missing out on so many things. So I don't want that to happen.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm sure. Because, you know, having people having the team logging into the individual inboxes and then taking care of chats as well on a different place. I can only imagine like, you know, how scattered everything is. So, chances of missing things definitely be higher in this scenario. Could you also help me understand how many people do we have in total that we are looking to implement this for across emails and chats?

Divya:
  We have five people, yuvta. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. In total, so we're looking at five. Yes, that includes you as well. If you could just help me understand a little bit about you and Ramesh as well. From the business point of view, I think that would also help.

Divya:
  Sure. So I am the customer support head here, Yukta and mr, Ramesh, sir, in the call, he's our CMO and he overlooks everything. But I take care of this department particularly, so that this five people includes me and my team of three people and Ramesh, sir?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Gotcha. Got it. Perfect. Great. Makes sense. Okay. I'll not ask you more questions now. Thank you so much for giving me such brief. Just last bit. I wanted to understand based on the form that you fill. You also mentioned whatsapp, so, are we only looking at email and chat or whatsapp is something that you're also interested in?

Divya:
  Yes, I'm currently looking at email and chat, but whatsapp, I am looking for my France market which will be done anytime sooner.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. But the team that you have across is the same team, right? It's.

Divya:
  the same team, a team of five people supporting here from India.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. Perfect. So let me just share my screen then now and show you how you could solve the major pain point that you're currently seeing which is, you know, having different channels on different places and not having a unified way of handling these support related inquiries. Now, just to give you a quick introduction of, hiver is a tool that integrates within your Gmail itself. So as we all use Gmail on a day to day, you know, lives, that team can actually manage all these channels, all the support inquiries while they are logged into their respective Gmail accounts. Now, I'm assuming that all of these all three people in your team, they have their own individual Gmail address?

Divya:
  No, they just have a common email address through which they log in the domain.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, so they don't have their own individual email address?

Divya:
  Yes, right. They don't have it right now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So we'll have to introduce that in order to use hiver, I think they can use their personal Gmail account, but I think from the company's privacy and confidentiality, I wouldn't really suggest that they are logging into like let's say, yuktaadharitgmail, com, and then, you know, accessing company related inboxes, I think that wouldn't be the ideal scenario. So if you can, then you can introduce three email addresses for them, give them their individual email addresses. Okay? Because you're also hosted on Google workspace, right? So Gmail is something that would be required as a prerequisite… like is this something that you could potentially explore, or would you rather have something as a standalone solution?

Divya:
  Yes, this is one option that we can look into it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I think I can give you an overview of how the platform works. Of course, after the call, you can have an internal discussion and see if you would want to explore that. So it's up to you. But to give you a brief idea, so how it works is you would connect your hiver within your Gmail itself. Like let's say you log in through Divya at the rate you have hiver here. So you can actually access all your support inboxes in one place as well as your chat as well as your whatsapp. So all these in here itself, as you can see, I have currently I'm part of four of such shared mailboxes in my company. I'm part of the whatsapp as well. And there's live chat as well which is connected. So with this what it'll help you being able to manage your personal inbox as you're doing today. And then you can access the support inbox. Let's say we create three for each region individually with the email addresses that you have. We invite all five team members. Now, all of you will be having the access to these. And at all times you would know that let's say this is support inbox. One. Let's say for us, right? So any email that is coming in will come into this unassigned section for your team to pick up and then start working on these. They can assign those emails between themselves. So at all times, we know who is working on what we have defined ownership and everything that you do gets recorded, right? So we know who is making what changes on any email, right? With that, they can also categorize their emails into different tags, right? Currently, I'm assuming that they might be using labels to maybe for their own name that, oh, these emails are handled by me or somebody else or categorizing. So instead of that, they can use tags. So tags are something that will help them categorizing their emails, right? Oh, we can create the tags, right? Yeah, you'll get a clean slate. So this will then become like your online repository. Oh, okay. And if you want to just look at emails related to one support query that you want to create a tag out of you go here and you can pick all those emails in one place itself, right? Okay. Now, as I assign the emails, they will no longer be in this section called unassigned. They'll go into the mind section of the person to whom we have given the ownership so that I know that these are the eight emails that I am responsible for there. Is no more confusion as to whether somebody else is handling it. I am handling it. I know that these are my emails and under team section, you still have the transparency and visibility to see across all team members, how the emails are distributed. So we still know that, okay, Rakesh is currently handling these three open tickets. If I want to go in, sort of assign it to myself, I can do that. If I want to give him a quick note. This could be helpful for you specifically since you're managing this team, you can email, you want to drop a note to that person who's working on it, let them know about something. You can do that, right? So then it becomes easier for you to be on the same platform. You can be able to do different things right now from here… now, since, you know, you would be part of three of such mailboxes. So obviously, it's not feasible to go into each one to see your own email. So if you want to look at all the emails that are assigned to you at all times across all the inboxes, you go into the assign to me section. And this is where you can pick them and you can focus, you know, here in one place from I'm, just taking a pause in case I'm going fast. If you have any questions.

Divya:
  No, no, I have no questions. Ramesh. Do you have any questions?

Divya:
  No, no questions. Yudha. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So this is something that you could do as the assignment like I showed you manually. But this is something we can also achieve as an automated process. We have AI tagging as well wherein let's say you are applying a same tag to an email. Repeatedly AI sort of learns that behavior. And from the eleventh time onward, it'll just automatically apply those tags for you so that your team does not have to do it for the assignment part. If you have a specific person looking after specific kind of emails, right? We can create that flow from the backend, wherein I'll just show you quickly as well. So if I just go into the support inbox, let's say from the automations here, we can set up certain workflows for ourselves to make life make our lives easier, right? Wherein we say that all the new details that are coming in and if they fulfill certain conditions, let's say they are with a specific subject line, right? Or there are certain keywords, you can then trigger an action wherein you say that these emails should get automatically assigned to, let's say, Yukta she's going to be taking care of it. We can also add a tag if we want that such emails should always get a tag of let's say, urgent issue, right? So we can always create such workflows ourselves for ourselves based on different, you know, things that you would like to achieve. Okay. Right now, coming back here in terms of when we are working on any email, right? Let's say this is the email that I currently have. I start working on it. I hit reply now, a couple of things you can do here as well. Number one, you can use email templates. Okay? So for your team to be more efficient and have some standardization when we are responding to emails, we can use these templates, create a repository, have it here so that our team can use it on a day to day basis. We also have AI co pilot here. Okay. Wherein we have ask AI, this is not, this is not a mandate functionality.

Divya:
  Yeah. But if.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  you would want to explore it. It will help you further be more efficient, be faster because it helps you drafting a response for you. It also helps you giving you any answers. So in the ask AI, you can actually feed your own knowledge source on which you want AI to train itself on. You can also add certain emails to the source as well so that it learns that, okay, this kind of communication happens in their company. So whenever you're asking any question, it gives you that reply right here and you can be more efficient while you're working on any email. Once I do that. And of course, I already showed you the internal collaboration. Yeah, you can always connect with someone else, your colleague, your manager. And once I have my reply, I just come here and change the status to close so that I know at all times the what's the status on each email, right? Whether it's open, whether it's pending, whether we have already closed it, so that it's your mind. You will not be hindered by the closed emails. You will only have all your open emails that you need to immediately work on. And once you have worked on them, all your closed ones will reside in our designated section here. Okay? So that if you get any reply on either closed or pending, they will come back into the mind section. Okay, right? So, this would be the basic workflow for the email chat works in the similar fashion wherein you can place your chatbot anywhere on your website that you would like. Now, from there, whenever someone initiates any chat, those will come here in the unassigned section. From there, you can assign it amongst the team members. And this is how it looks like from the interface that currently it's assigned to Cole. He will pick this up. He will start chatting with the visitor. You can know where this chat has been initiated from. You can categorize these as well with the help of tags and you can mark the status as per open and closed so that your agents, they don't have to flip between Gmail and other platforms. They can handle the chats here itself.

Divya:
  That's wonderful.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And then lastly, of course, we have, whatsapp? Also you can connect here. So like chat, the interface is going to be the same. You can assign it between team members and they can respond to messages as they are coming.

Divya:
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So these would be the channels, Divya Ramesh. If you have any question on this, what do you think so far?

Divya:
  So far, it's wonderful youpta. Just one question. How do I see? I have my existing answer templates with me so that the customers don't have to wait for the answers? How do I feed them?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Email templates?

Divya:
  Email or chat? I do have ready made answers for certain questions based on keywords.

Divya:
  Okay? So I want my AI to reply to that questions based on the keywords that is asked by a customer. How do I feed that data to the AI?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  For the email, AI will not be able to automatically send the response on your behalf, but you can like if you have ready made templates already there. Yeah, right. So you can first of all, create the repository here in hiver. So you can do that. And then when you're responding to any emails, you can use the email templates like through AI, which will suggest you as to, you know, which template to put in, any email based on the keywords there, and it can suggest the right template, then you can insert that. But are you asking that if AI could, you know, you could feed sort of to AI and then it learns that and then automatically responds?

Divya:
  Yeah, true. Yeah, that's what I'm asking for.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that is something which is currently not there in hiver in terms of the chat. Also, you can put a chatbot here. So instead of chats coming directly to the agent or getting assigned to them, you can create a chatbot here wherein you can deflect messages, the conversation as someone visits, you can create your own workflow. It goes like the first message will be prompted, they will be asked to, you know, choose from these questions and then give their details and all of that. And then accordingly, it gets passed to the agent. You can also put our help articles in chat. So if you want to just give them a quick understanding, if they, if they're looking for these things, then they can just, you know, go through these articles and get the answers. Otherwise, if they don't find it, and then they, you know, come to the chat and, you know, connect with the agent.

Divya:
  Oh, so AI responses are not there on chatbot, and also on the email it has to.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Not yet. Yeah, not yet, but AI agents is something that we are coming up with really soon. I think it's going to be launched by end of this month if I'm not wrong. So at that point, the AI agents will be able to take up the conversation as well before it gets assigned to a human. Is this something that is like a absolute must have for you or something like it'll? Be great to have that as well?

Divya:
  It will be great to have that as well because the customers doesn't have to wait because of the difference in time zone, so you as UK customers or France customers, we from, we have different time zones, right? So if AI is there in place, I think they'll get the answers that they require. So that's one thing I'm looking at.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So currently, we wouldn't have that, but I can update you once we are launching it and then you can see accordingly. Yeah.

Divya:
  No problem. And my second question is, where do I set the SLA breach? Yutta?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So SLA, we can set up in the admin panel here. Huh. And, so for different emails, you can set up the SLA policy for the post response time where you would want to send the response. Divya, just give me one minute now. Yeah, just 30 seconds. I'm so sorry. Well, I don't know.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm so sorry.

Divya:
  No problem.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, here, you can set up the SLA, like, you can set up the first response, here and the resolution, you can set up as, you know, how much time they should be taking, where the email is closed. So that could be a 24 hours. SLA, you can also make like specifically for each tag. So that is also something that you could do. And once you have created these policies, it's going to look something like this wherein currently, it's gray red. So as soon as an email gets assigned, it's turned gray. When they're breaching an SLA, it turns red. It's orange when they have some time to still action upon any email. So these SLA, you can set up. And in the analytics part, this will help you then getting some idea on how we are performing against those slas that we have set up for the team. So, for any specific timeline, you can analyze this data, let's say for forced response violation. I'm going to analyze this further, go into each person and understand how they have been, you know, responding. Then we can see which emails we've breached the SLA on specifically, and why, right? So, this is something under analytics and you can see not just for SLA, but for the workload distribution across each user, how they're responding to emails. How does the traffic look like for each, you know, inbox that we have? So all of this, you can get under analytics.

Divya:
  Oh, okay. Can I, download the data? Yukta. Like I, if I want to understand like all this analytics or the SLA bridge, can I download this? And can I also download the customer questions and whatever they're asking for, is it being answered or not? How do I get that analytics report?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can export the report to CSV, if you want to export it based on different parameters here, you can definitely do that. So, based on the status of the email and different things, you can always export these reports.

Divya:
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And for the live view, in terms of each inbox, you can always go under team section. And this is where, sorry, in the old views, you will be able to see all the overdue emails at this point. As of today, how many emails we have already breached the SLA on, and why we have done that? Then you can go into each email and see what's really happening and then connect with the person as well and get some updates that's required.

Divya:
  Oh, okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right. So, this would be your day to day view.

Divya:
  Okay. Great. So the chatbot can be placed on our website and the flow can be set and it will sit here in the, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  In the chat, yeah, in the inbox?

Divya:
  Okay. I think those are my questions mainly. So, do you have any questions?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Sorry, I was on mute. Sorry, no, I knew that.

Divya:
  No questions from. So, okay. Yeah, that's a tip that this is all I wanted to know.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cool. Then no worries. Then what do you suggest as the next step from here? Would you want to discuss this internally? And then we should connect back for a quick feedback or we also have a free trial, but I would suggest that if you want to do free trial between you and Ramesh, probably we could do that otherwise, if you want to take this internally first and then we connect back, we can, I'm open to do that as well. Yeah.

Divya:
  I would like to discuss this internally with Ramesh. So once and I'll get back to you quickly on the zipta.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. No worries. Just a small request if it's okay to connect like on Wednesday for like 10 minutes around the same time, sure.

Divya:
  Sure. I can connect with you on Wednesday. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Then. Yeah, great. Anything else that I could help you with?

Divya:
  For now, nothing, Yukta. I think I've got the information I'll get back to you on Wednesday. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, thank you. All right. Thank you so much. Take care. Bye.
