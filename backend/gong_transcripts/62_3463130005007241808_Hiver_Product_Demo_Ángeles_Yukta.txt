================================================================================

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Adil. How are you? Hello? How are you? Doing well? Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, angelius. How are you doing? Hi, how are you? I'm good. Thank you. How are you?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  I'm fine. Thank you. Sorry about yesterday. I couldn't get on the meeting.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. I think Adil and I had an extensive discussion in terms of, you know, your requirements, what you're exactly looking for, and I tried to sort of tailor the demonstration accordingly as well. Did you get a chance to go through the recording of the session yesterday?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yeah, most of it. Yes, I did. So we decided today to do the upgrade. And so we got, the pro packet and now we need help to set up everything. I already added the four indexes we need. And well, now the idea is to, so that you can help us a little bit.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let's do that. So, the process from here on, firstly, I did check your account, I saw that you have added the users there, but I think the inbox has not been created yet if I'm not wrong or you have set it up. Okay, perfect. So you have four shared inboxes that you have currently set, up, right? So, are these going to be the final number of inboxes or there will be more?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yes, for the moment, this four, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And we have four users that I can see currently perfect. Sounds great. So you have done the basic setup to start with, which is great. I think in terms of the other stuff, you have to first invite the other two users. They have to accept the invite as well so that they can also start using it. And in the meantime, what we can do. So ideally, what happens is you would be getting a customer success manager assigned to you and to your account dedicatedly, who is going to be helping sort of laying out the onboarding plan for you, making sure that everything is set up like how we discuss the AI functionalities, the templates that we want to put in there and other stuff as well. And with that, if it's required for the team as well to get trained once, like if we are more than happy to give you that demonstration or to them, so that as they get started on the tool, the team understands it fully and they don't face any issues as they go forward. And of course, as you go along, you would have the customer success manager being there and also the support team who is available 24 seven. So for any technical assistance, you can always raise any concern. So I would want to understand from you for today's, purpose for this call. Do you want to sort of set up certain automations templates and all right now or is it okay for you to wait while I assign this to the right person within the customer success team and they schedule the session with you and then do the onboarding with you guys. What do you suggest?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yeah. Well, we thought that this was an onboarding session now. So this is what we thought. We just want to start using it and we needed some help.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We can do that. So let's do it. Let me only help you. I mean, I don't mind doing that and then later if they want to connect with you, they can do it and you can then discuss with them. So if you want to just share your screen angelus, I think then we can get started.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yes. Okay. One second. Yeah, I think this is the one. Can you see that I?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can see your screen? Yes. Thank you. So we have all the inboxes set up here. Yes?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Before, when I just put them there, I went into, well, imagine, let's say this one here. And when I clicked here on assigned, I had a pop up that said, do you want to import or configure? Yeah. But now it's gone. So I don't know how to get back there. And yeah, what?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Was the pop up? Was it to get all the historical emails here or?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Something? No, it said if I wanted to start using it, there were some questions I had to answer. Do you want to set up this? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Those must be set up questions. No worries. So now that you can see we have all the inboxes here, you have emails coming in the unassigned section as well. This seems to be like a lot of emails that you currently have. So we'll have to sort these out as well.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yeah, but we actually have already gone through those emails from the real inbox.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  I have one question when you read an email from the real inbox, then it stays here as unassigned, it will.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Stay here as it is. So now, the whole idea is that when you're managing your inboxes within hiver, we do not have to go into the original inbox at this.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Point we are doing it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So whatever you're doing there, it's not going to reflect here. Your emails are still going to remain in the unassigned section. And also now, we don't have to rely on the read and unread functionality of Gmail, because in hiver, your emails are going to be tracked on the basis of which section they are currently in. So as you can see currently, we have these many unassigned emails, which essentially means that nobody has picked these emails yet. As you click on any email that's where you would have the option. So we can take one as an example. Now here, you have the activity panel on the right side. So this email is actually part of two inboxes at the same time. One is the pda and the PDP. So in the PDP, you have already closed this. So you can also close this email from pda as well. Oh, did.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  we receive the email to both.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Places? Oh, yes, we did.

Odilesb:
  Oh, it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is from?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  This one to the other, okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it must be part of it. So info and all. So that's why you see it, both the places, what you can do is you can just simply close that from the right status column one second.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Because I'm not sure if this one is closed.

Odilesb:
  No, I don't think it has been replied just from four minutes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Ago, yes.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  I will go to this one here. Yeah, let's say this one, which is, so I will say here closed, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, this is the manual way of doing it. Like you already mentioned that you have worked on those emails which are currently showing here. So what you can do, you can just bulk select all those emails and just close all of them so that we know that we have already worked on those. And for any emails that come in from today onwards, you can then deal with those within hiver itself, right? Okay.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So I can show you as an example. So if you want to just select all the emails in the unassigned section, and you'll see the flag button there on the right? Yeah. Okay. Just change the status for all of these.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Okay. I will do that after, yeah, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can definitely do this. And then once everybody is on board on hiver from there onwards, as, and when the emails start coming in, you can start managing those from here itself. Okay. Right. Do you understand the basic functionality in hiver, how email comes in? Then you assign it to the specific person, how you can change the status?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yeah, I think, yeah, we do understand that. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, the mind section will show everyone in terms of what emails are assigned to them specifically. So this is the section that they should be looking out for when they have been assigned any email. And since you have multiple shared inboxes here, so the best thing to do is just rely on the assigned to me section here, right? Because this section will give you all the emails that are assigned to you across all the four inboxes. So you don't have to individually go into each one, right? Okay.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  But let's say that we didn't assign the emails because just the person that first picks the email will answer. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That way also, you can do when the person answers the email gets automatically assigned to that person. Yeah. So it'll automatically be assigned to them. They will see it in their mind section. So you don't have, you don't necessarily have to go and give the ownership first. Whoever sees the email first, they can just respond, it gets assigned to them. And that's where we know as to this is the person who is actually working on this email. So have better visibility and we know, okay, this has been taken care of, right?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  And where do we set that up?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'm sorry.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Where do we set it up? I mean, where do I say this is for this person? And for the other one automatically not manually automatically?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. We can set up notifications as well. So, is there any example that you would want to share with me? That these are the kind of emails that I would like to see? Yes, I.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Want that all emails from PDP?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Go to before?

Odilesb:
  We move on about the assign to me. If I reply an email from the unassigned automatically, it goes assigned to me. Yes. But then the customer replies, this goes to my assign. I mean, one moment, one moment I take an unassigned email, I reply it, that goes automatically assigned to me and I close this email. If the customer replies, it… will go assigned to me again or it will go to an, it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Will go to assigned to me again since you were the one who was working on this email. So, if and if you have already closed it, if the customer replies on that, firstly, the status will change again to open and the email will get assigned to you by default since you were the one who was working before. Unless, if you don't want that, if you want the email to then get go into the unassigned, you can just mark yourself as you can just remove yourself as the owner when you're closing that email.

Odilesb:
  Ah, okay. Yeah. But then we don't know who replies it or?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yes. One second. Dice. Que, sí, que, cuando, tú, lo cierras. Le quites, Tu asignación. SE, VE, ya que, has contestado, tú pero, luego, lo, des asignas. ¿sabes?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, vale?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  But one question can I set up that all the emails that come here to this inbox here? Can I say that all the unassigned emails? I mean, can an email be assigned to two persons at the same time? No?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It will be assigned to one person at the same time. The way we?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Work is that everything is unassigned and you just pick what's done. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What we can do is see if there are no rules and you want whoever is part of this inbox for the email to get assigned on a round Robin basis. Let's say email comes in first comes to me then to angeles, then to Odile, and that's how you want to roll it. We can just enable the auto assignment in the backend so that nobody has to manually assign those emails. Will that work for you?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yeah, for the moment, I think so. Yes, where do we?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do that. Yeah, we can set that up or could you click on this hiver icon on top next to the bell icon? Please? Awesome. Yes, click on admin panel… go to share and click on auto assignment here. Hello. Okay. Yeah. Choose the inbox that you would like to set this up on. Okay? So this is the auto assignment, right? Functionality wherein we can enable this. Currently, it is disabled, and this will allow emails to get automatically assigned to the right person, right? So on a round Robin basis, email will get assigned to the team members. So what it says, this is going to be for all the incoming emails that are coming into this inbox, we can exclude people as well. So, for example, you are also part of this inbox, but you do not work on emails, you can exclude yourself so that these emails, you know, do not get assigned to you. This is one, you can also set a limit as to at max, how many emails one person should have within their radar, right? So this is also something you can set here. So to maintain the load balancing for the team.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Okay. So here's where we set up everything?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So this is the admin panel. This is where you will find all the functionalities, automations, slas, that you would like to set up. So you can set those from here. I will suggest to not enable this right now because currently, we have a lot of emails to first clean the entire thing. Once that is done, you can just come here and enable this once the entire team is ready to receive emails, right? So we can do that. Apart from this. Are there any specific rules that you would like to set up? For example, I think udheel mentioned that, you know, for all the emails which are cancellation requests, usually get handled by one person in the team. Anything like that you would like to set up? Yeah, any example that you could share with me so that we can set one automation for now? Udheel?

Odilesb:
  Well, there's I don't know.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That would be any.

Odilesb:
  Email that says something about cancellations that would be transferred assigned to at least two people. No, because we can be two of us that we do cancellations or three of us?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can do between two or three people as well. We can just assign it among these three people. So the email comes in with cancellation request, go to these three people on a round Robin basis. So we can set this up. Let's see how that works. So if you click on the automations here, angelus… hello, AI, do you see my red marker by any chance on the screen?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yes, but there's no. Okay. Yes. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We were looking which shared inbox, do you receive this?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  One? Yeah, perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Now, click on automations here. Perfect. Create automation. Okay? We can name this as cancellation emails so that to know what this automation is about. So this is where basically, this is your window of creating any sort of workflows rules for yourself to automate your process as much as possible. There are a lot of things that you can do which you can explore at your time as well or you could let us know as to if there is anything specific you would like to do in regards to any email tags that you have created and things like that. We can explore it here. So for now, we'll stick to the first option which says any new conversation that is received and we will click on add step wherein we will put a condition. We will say if condition and the condition is going to be a select condition within the subject. So you would, I'm assuming these keywords are going to be either in the subject or the body of the email, right? Which tells you this is about cancellation?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Okay. We will. Yeah, I think we will understand how to.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do this. Yes, you can just, you can put that right now. I think it'll be best that we can create one for now. We, you can also add in the, or condition within the body of the email. So that also helps if it's anywhere in the body of the email, you can put the keywords here.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yeah. Let's say this just for the moment. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Now we'll click on add step… action. Perfect. Select action. We will, okay, assign among is actually not enabled in your… I think that's part of the elite plan then. Yes. So for now, what you can do is you can assign this to a specific person in the team and.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Or maybe we can send it to a specific folder this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is a shared inbox basically add conversation to. So you have four shared inboxes. So if you'd like to move any email from one shared inbox to a, to another shared inbox, that's where that option, you know, is helpful. For now, you can assign this to one person. And what we can do is we can add followers on this email. So I'll tell you how that will work. So can you first click on assign to yeah… assign to one person? And then add step… and click on action, select action, add followers. And you can then probably say that you would like to here, you can add multiple people. So what this will do? Since right now, we are not on the elite plan, if you would like to have it in terms of assign among itself and then have multiple people, you know, be able to get these emails for that. You can, I mean, you can see if you would like to upgrade to an elite plan, but if not, then this is the way work around here where you can assign the emails to one person, but you can add followers so that these people also will receive emails into their following section. I'll show you where that is. And if they would like to then take up any email, they can just reassign those emails to themselves. So this is something that we could do. But yeah, for now, you can assign it to one person in the team.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  So I save this, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Just save this and enable it. Perfect. So likewise, we can create more if you cross this and come out of the admin panel, this is where you have all your following emails. So, do you see this below assigned to me? So this is the place where you see all the emails that you're following. So this is what we have added there. So all the cancellation emails will go to a deal. But it will also be coming into this folder for the person who are the followers here.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Okay. I understand.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Apart from this, have you also explored tags? We can also create tags here to categorize your emails into different categories.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Odile. Do you have one?

Odilesb:
  I… don't know.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I don't know.

Odilesb:
  Let's say bookings or information booking request? I don't know.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Info. Let's.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  say info request?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. I'm so sorry. So likewise here, you can have multiple of tags, right? This is one that you have just created. We can create more as well and you can start applying these tags on emails to sort of categorize and understand what this email is actually about. And we can train AI to automatically then start applying those tags for you. So for now, we'll take this as an example request and we'll go into the admin panel… and we'll add this tag into the AI source so that AI learns the behavior in terms of what sort of emails you're applying these tags on? Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I don't know what's.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  going on, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This should not take this long. One second. Let's see if it helps. Can you go to the shared inboxes? Probably we can try going from there?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Where?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Click on the shared inboxes. The second option?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Go to the respective inbox. Click on AI. Okay. This is the AI tagging that I was just talking about. We will configure this. We will add the tag that we just created. Okay? We'll select this, add it. Now. AI will learn the behavior on initial 10 emails. What sort of emails are applying this tag on? And then it will from the train AI, it will move to manage tags and it's going to automatically start applying those tags for you on those emails.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Okay. Perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Apart from this, we also discuss the templates and the ask AI wherein you could, if you come back from here from the AI tagging.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Click on AI copilot there. Okay? Enable the ask AI first. We can also enable our AI compose. This will also help you. Okay? Now, click on knowledge sources. Okay? So now this is where you can actually upload any of your company documents, PDF or any of the things for AI to train itself on. Basically. And while you're working on any email, if you want AI to draft a response for, you can just click on the draft a reply like I showed in the demo video yesterday, and it will give you the response which you can just insert in the email itself. But for AI to do that, you just have to upload relevant documents here in order for it to be able to understand all about your company and how you're managing these inbox, what sort of communication you have with your customers?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Okay, perfect. Right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Any question on this? Anything that I could help you understand more or this is clear?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yeah, I have a question here on chat. Okay. Does this mean that we can cancel our actual chat that we have on the web from Zendesk?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can do that. Yes, of course, you can use if we use?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  This chat here and this bot, then the other one we have on the website now?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you'll have to discontinue that. Yes. So you're using you were using Zendesk so far? Just.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  For the chat? Oh.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Just for the chat? Yeah, I mean, then hiver gives you both the functionality for email and chat. So I would highly recommend that you actually use chat within hiver itself so that you don't have to, you know, be your additional cost there. So we can definitely set this up as well.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Okay, perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So whenever you're ready whenever you have removed it from Zendesk or you can just set this up here. All you have to do at the end is copy the code and put it on your website and I think that'll be live.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Okay. And does this chat also gets the information from the AI documents?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It, does we have AI agent here so you can upload that? I'm not sure though if it's the Gmail, we have it in our Omni product for sure, but anything specific that you would like to achieve from the chat front? Would you want AI to deflect your answers or what exactly are you looking for?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  I don't know yet. We have to look about at the moment. We have a chat in our website and a bot. So if we're not ready to answer, the bot comes up and it goes through some questions and answers.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So we can, yeah, we can set up the workflows. So that should be good enough. Yeah. So we have bot configuration as well here. Okay? I would just want to understand so that I can let the CSM know about it. Like at what stage would you like to set up your chat? Would it be immediately or sometime later once you have explored email?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Sorry, I didn't hear you. I'm.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  sorry, I just want to understand at what stage would you like to set up the chat as well? Do you want to do this immediately or sometime later? Yeah.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  No, no. We want to do it now. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So we can, what you can do is you can just name the chat here. So what you want to call it, add users here. Hit next, this is where you can design this as per your color widget, I can. What? Okay, perfect. You can change the heading if you want or do it later. Let's.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  leave it like this for the moment. It's fine. Perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hit next. It has only English or, it can have messages in all languages. This will be in English, but you can always type your message in other languages as well. So that should be good enough.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So this is the code that you have to copy on the website. And this should be live. Once this is live. Once you have done that, then you can create the automations, the bot workflows, as well as to how you would like to deflect these conversations as the visitors come.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Okay. And then I will do this after, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And your live chat will be right below your shared inbox from where the agents can then manage those chats on a day to day basis. Okay. Right. Okay. Apart from this from the templates perspective, those are going to be under email templates. If you come out of the admin panel, you will see it at the front screen. Oh, yeah. Across. Yeah. So this is where you have your templates. So you can start creating these templates. Odile told me that you have to create templates in six different languages or four different languages. So what I suggested her is you create folders for each language and put templates within each folder for a specific language so that accordingly, you can choose from and then insert it in your responses. Okay. Yeah. Right. So this is the folder under this. You can just copy paste or upload all your templates here itself, right? Okay. So these are the things that I think are going to be relevant for you as you start using the tool. I know there's a lot that needs to be done. So what you can do is you can in the meantime create templates, upload these templates, think about what tags you would like to create to categorize your emails, and also put the knowledge source in the AI. So for AI to start training itself on that. And in the next session, your customer success manager can then help you with the progress that we have made so far. And if there are any other steps that needs to be taken from the setup perspective or the team training, they would be able to then guide you from there. Okay? Anything else that you would like me to sort of help you with anything else that is important for you that we might have not covered today?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  I think I'm fine. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Odilesb:
  I think it's okay, perfect. Perfect. There's also phone. I've seen.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  There is phone, but we are, currently, we only connect with Aircall at this point as a calling provider. Do you use any calling provider within your organization as such? Yes, we, downstream… I'm sorry, which one could you put it on chat? Where the chat is?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  I don't know where the chat is.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's in the right at, in the middle at the bottom of your screen, but anyway, just.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  To let you know it's downstream? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So currently, we only integrate with Aircall as the calling provider. Okay? So this is the provider that we only connect with. What exactly would you like to achieve from the call? I can actually put this to the product team and see if it is possible anywhere to sort of achieve that… well. It was just a question.

Odilesb:
  Yeah, curiosity. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. So currently, we wouldn't have that, but yeah, if you need any assistance there, let us know and we can then dig into it and see if what's possible there?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Knowledge base is also something that if you'd like to create, you can create within hiver itself. This would be helpful. You can either create it for internal employees or you can create it for external. I know that you have some people only working for three months during summers. So for them to be up to speed to understand all about the company, have one, you know, source of knowledge. Okay? You can all put all of that in the knowledge base itself. So you can actually set this up also if you find it useful. So this can be covered as well. Okay. Yeah.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Perfect. Yeah, perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think sounds good to get started. I think this looks pretty good. Like I mentioned as a next step. You will soon hear from the team as well, and we can then set up another session and get you started with the usage in the meantime.

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Yeah. I have one last question when I made the payment, I was only allowed to select two or five users, but for the moment, we are actually four, is there a way we can download to four?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's a good question that's because we sell in a bucket of five.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That is the reason why, you know, you were charged for five users. I mean, that's the, that's how it's set up from the back end itself for, as per the costing and how it works. So that is why you could see as a minimum option of two users, then it goes in the bucket of five, which is five. The next bucket you will fall under is going to be 10. And then… so, yeah, that's how it's going to be after. I think you have gone for the monthly subscription for now, right?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  Just for the moment, because I wanted to test, we want to try for one or two months and then decide. Yeah, got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It, so, once you know, you come near to your, you know, when your subscription is ending by end of this month, just let us know before that if there is, there are any adjustments that you need. Do you want more number of users? Which is not 10? But let's say six or seven. I'm more than happy to help you with something that could accommodate for that cost if possible at that point. So, we can always, look at that once your subscription ends. Okay. Perfect. No worries. Anything else that I could help you with today?

Ángeles Bros (angeles@eldelfinverde.com):
  No, I think we are coming.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's perfect. Thank you so much. I'll just share the details over the email and yeah, we look forward to working with you from here.

Odilesb:
  Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Thank.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You. Bye, bye, bye bye.
