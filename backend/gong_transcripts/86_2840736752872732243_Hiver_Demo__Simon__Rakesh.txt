================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, Simon. Good morning.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Hi, Rakesh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi. Can you hear me? Okay?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Hey, good morning.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi. How are you doing, sir? Yeah, very good. Very good. How are you? Lovely. Good. Thank you so much for joining in. My name is Rakesh. And I take care of sales for the european territory at hiver. I've been with the company for over four years, have personally onboarded more than 500 teams. So I'll be the point of contact today, run the show, try to understand if this is a good platform as per your needs?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Now, to begin with Simon, do you want to tell me what do you essentially take care of the business? What were you looking at? That prompted you on hiver website?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  So, we are doing water damage restoration. And so we have lots of clients. We have lots of small construction sites, for example, right now, we have about more than 2000 active construction sites. Most of them are smaller from a 1,000 to 5,000 euro. So, it's not like 100,000. It's lots of small customers that we have, and I need a tool like for customer relation, and mainly for flagging. So, it's like we communicate with our customers via Gmail. And we have a problem that some of our employees, they don't answer why? Like the customer, he writes an angry email and our support, they don't reply accordingly. They forget to reply the email or they, yeah, they just forget things. And I'm looking for a tool which can flag me these emails and show me here. Our support team didn't reply or they didn't reply accordingly or like a flagging tool that's what I'm looking for?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Okay. And do you want to tell me, Simon, where do we receive all of these customer inquiries today? Like, is that a common inbox for everybody?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yes. Like for like we are in Germany, we have different place like we are like our office is only in Berlin and all our like office employers are also in Berlin. And we, the most messages are via email. Like we have for Berlin, like for our standards? Like a place like we have for Berlin, we have an email inbox. We have an inbox for Munich. We have an inbox for Hamburg. So it's separate inboxes, but it's normally, it's one inbox for the, yeah, for a place, what?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is that one common inbox for all the requests today?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Gmail?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, is that Berlin at the rate your company domain? Com, is that a main inbox email?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yes. So, yeah, yes, exactly. We have Berlin at trocknerheld, de, that's one inbox. Then we also have info at trocknerheld, info is like information at trocknerheld, it's like where everyone sends, but normally people send to Berlin or to Munich at trocknerheld.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Berlin at the rate and info at the rate. These are mainly two inboxes where you receive all the requests from your different vendors, suppliers, your customers also.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Can,, you, can I also understand how big is the team that deals with all the emails today? Like how many customer support people do you have today in your team?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Like from the whole company or like the biggest team at trocknerheld Berlin? There are right now, there are six people replying emails. Like there's a customer support team, like we call them account manager because they also organize the construction sites, they call, with the Guy on the construction site, with the subcompany with the, yeah. So it's like a company. Then we have Munich. We have three. So all, they have about 30 30 people only doing customer support.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Six people are the account managers. And are you saying?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  There are six people in Berlin, like six people in Berlin, like with all the different, like with whole Germany, we have about 30.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Three, zero 30 people. Okay. So if you're looking at a solution, are you looking at for six people or all 30 people?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Ah, no, I'm looking for a solution maybe for two or three people like to check because these people, they do their work and they have like their daily business. And I'm looking for a solution for people who do the quality management, like it's for maybe two or three people.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So two or three people will be managing the emails. And how about the other three people? Like, would you not want to have solution for them?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  It depends on the kind of solution. It depends on the solution because right now, I'm looking like for solution for flagging emails. So this will be not three of the six people. It will be three extra people. It's really people like only doing quality management like quality control and quality management. And this tool is for them to see where the faults have been made or where we can improve. So, it's they will go to the other people and tell them, hey, like this construction sites, you made the problem or like this customer, you made here a problem or this, you could do better. And this tool is for them, to see the things because they can check 2000 sites. So it's like this tool is for, yeah, to organize the sites and to analyze the communication so that they can actively improve it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. And if I were to understand what are the major challenges and problems you're trying to solve? I understand all the emails that are coming into common inbox or transparency and visibility is one that you have to have a solution to look at these emails, how many of them are done? How many of them are still pending? But apart from transparency and visibility, what is it that you're looking to achieve? Like what are those major challenges today?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Majorchance asks also of course, like replying accordingly, it's also like a sentiment analyzer, you know, if the customer's angry so that the tool can tell us here, the customer's angry, we have to do a different approach to him, you know, maybe give him a discount or maybe like something like the things that we do, we can like determine ourselves, but the software should like do like analyzation of how the customer writes. And yeah. So maybe what we want to accomplish is like that the customer gets treated better, like he gets replied faster. Like if we reply him more on point and yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. Do you have any solution today at the moment that you're using to manage these emails or is that paid you on Gmail?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  No, it's paid Gmail?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. And what are the timelines you're looking for this solution or any solution that you happen to choose? Are you looking at fixing these problems in this month or in a quarter? What time?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  It depends like there are different steps, you know, like the first step is only the flagging tool, which is flagging emails, for example, where our support team didn't reply at all or where we didn't prepare for this flagging tool. Then of course, there are other tools like giving suggestions about replying like this whole other stuff of CM like a lot of things. There are a lot of things. But the flagging tool I want to implement very fast, maybe two weeks like I want to implement it, really fast.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So basically in two to four weeks maximum, you're looking to have at least a plain solution to manage these emails start work on these emails.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And can I understand who along with you will be the actual decision maker on this project?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Sorry, again.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Could you tell me along with yourself? Who will be the main decision maker on the project?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  It depends maybe the investor like if he has some veto, but I think the main decision will be for me and.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I have.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Two business partners. Like normally, I'm more in like technical quality management, like one of my business partner, normally, she's doing the quality management of the support team, but she's now she had a child but she's starting like with working back, so she will also look at it. But she's right now, she's like she's very working one or two hours a day. So it will be mainly me.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood very clear. All right. And with regards to the pricing, did you have a look at our website? Like do you have any queries about the different plans and pricing we offer today?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. To be honest, I didn't check the price yet.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. No worries. What I can do is maybe give you a quick product walkthrough and we'll also discuss the pricing and let's see if this is what you're looking to achieve with hiver? Yeah. Okay. All right. So give me one minute. Let me quickly share my screen and we'll quickly look at how hiver functions. And in the meanwhile, if you come across any more questions, just feel free to let me know and I'll answer all of those questions for you.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right, great. Let me know if you are looking into Gmail inbox for my test account. Yeah. Okay. Now, Simon, if you notice I'm logged in into my Rakesh at hiver, this is my test account. So all your customer support people, all your account managers, whoever need to work on these emails via hiver, they need to simply log in into their individual inboxes. Mind it. They're not logging into info at the rate inbox or Berlin at the rate that's not needed at all. They simply log in into their plain Gmail accounts today. Yeah, this is a hiver extension. It's a Chrome plugin that needs to be installed, just a one time activity on personal inboxes. And anything that you see in yellow sitting on top of my Gmail screen is hiver sitting in here. Okay. So basically, when I log in into my Gmail, I have hiver running on top of it, I have my personal emails in the top inbox. So anything that is sent to Rakesh at hiver, I would see that in the personal inbox, no changes at all. These are my private emails. I can keep working the way I want it today without having to have any interference at the same time. If you notice, I've got these multiple shared mailboxes, customer success. I've got finance, this could be account management. This could be our Berlin in the inbox. This could be our info inbox, right? So all of these are going to be our shared inboxes in hiver. The way we are going to be setting it up is your existing info at the rate email address and Berlin at the same email address. They will be used to create a shared mailbox in hiver. So we will create an inbox, in hiver, connect it to your existing email address. And that's when you would have all the brand new requests coming into the unassigned folder for everybody in the team.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So you will add your people to the info inbox and your operations inbox, or whatever those two inboxes are your Berlin and info. And that's where you would have the brand new requests in the unassigned when you assign request or ticket to somebody in the team, it becomes part of mine. If you assign it to yourself from team section, you would see how many total requests are open, which representative?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Emails you assign these emails manually or does hiver assign them manually?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Both ways, it is possible either I'm looking at the email for an example, I'm looking at this email, understanding the email and then from the activity panel, I'm assigning it either to myself or to anybody in the team manually or you tell hiver that if the email subject content of the email. If this talks about something in specific, hiver automatically assigns email to people in your team.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Okay. So you can tell like if the customer writes to a special construction site starting with letter a, it's going to assign to this.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Email. Yeah. Okay. Automatically. It's also possible to the workflows. Yes. Yeah. Okay. All right. Apart from that, this is the status emails are in open by default when they receive it in your inbox today. But when you're working, you can choose to keep them in pending with the project ongoing. You're not resolving it. But once you're done with the request, you can close the conversation and it marks done reply would happen the same way you do that in Gmail, the same Gmail reply. But you have got email customer satisfaction, like you want to find out how happy your customers are with the level of support. So you can do a customer satisfaction. You can use the templates for repetitive nature of email queries. Now, when you're replying to the customer, let's say if it is a test reply, you get an option to reply from your personal email address, which is your individual accounts or from your info inbox or from your Berlin at the real email address as well. A couple of things on the top. When you summarize the conversation, you don't have to go through the entire email. Let's say if it's a complicated email, hiver will literally help you decode that and tell you what must have happened so far. And customer is asking for X y Z. So it can simplify the request for you.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  To the summarization, but it only summarizes the emails in the same email… thread. Yeah, the same email thread. It doesn't check different emails, it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Won't, check the different email. Now, hiver will treat all the emails in a thread. Let's say if I reply to this customer and this customer, I'm done with the query and I close the conversation. If the customer again replies to the same email, it will open up in the mind section for me. And I can then have three email chains to it. So hiver will treat all the emails in a thread and that thread can be summarized by hiver as such.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Okay. But you can combine three of these threads.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, yes. I can let's say, if this customer contacted me in the past with the same email account, all I can do is I can link the conversation here. So I can find the conversation, the one which is relevant, maybe another email with the same customer. I can search for it and I can link it.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Because we have some customers, for example, who write every time they write a new email, they don't reply, they write a new one. It's a new email. So I can link them.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You can link it or you can go to the contact bucket here. And from the contact page, you can see all the older conversations, also the recent one from the same customer or company.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Ah, okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Apart from that, when I want to talk to my colleagues in the team, I can add mention them, and I can say, hey, Cole, can you help me with this one? This is basically without forwarding emails to my teammates, I can talk to my colleagues internally right here in the comments.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah, okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  These comments will actually come into the notes section here. And then the bell icon. And from here, I could see if there are new emails assigned to me, if there is anybody commenting me on the email, and that's how I can collaborate on the team sections.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All the emails which are pending, let's say, I'm not solving these emails immediately, Simon. So I can keep these emails in pending and the pending requests will move to the pending folder. I would also be able to see which representative is working on these pending requests. The one which are done, the resolved conversations will be found inside the closed bucket for resolved.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So that's how you could go ahead and manage all these conversations by the way. And the way you said you want to have these emails run faster responses. So let's say when I'm actually working on any of those tickets, I would have those first response time, the slas running on the top of these emails. So you can choose to say, do you want to reply in two hours for all these emails? Do you want to resolve meaning you want to close this ticket in eight hours in a day? So you can run slas at the back end? And this actually keeps me telling in all the views, how many emails are about to due. So I would see the due soon emails and the ones which are overdue, which are all the ones which are not done in time. So I can even make sure that I have those triggers running. And the red tag frt is the first response overdue. So these emails are already missed by the way in the first response. Yeah. So when I turn on the AI sentiment, so this is exactly what we are referring to. You want to find out this is a sentiment neutral, customer is fine. Not happy, not sad. But if there is a customer which probably writes something like, hey, I want to cancel my account. I'm not happy. Give me the refund. So this actually starts to tell you a negative face as a sentiment. Let me see if I could show you something on. Okay, now, if you see this is a green face that says this is an appreciation, customer is happy. The sentiment is positive. These are neutral. This is a sad customer. So if you notice sentiment is negative, the email expresses concern with the mild frustration. So all of this is a part of hiver AI that can literally help you read the emails and help you understand if this is happy, sad, neutral customers and you can run reports also on top of it.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. These tags will help you categorize emails. For an example, this email is about location, a construction site B, or if it's about refund, if it's an escalation, so you can create your own tags and categorize emails on those folders. So basically, you can have hiver run the exact tag on top of it automatically. If hiver reads an email, says this is escalation, hiver can tag these emails automatically for you. Also. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And these tags are shared amongst everybody in the team. Meaning if you want to find out how many refund emails are getting in today, you just simply type refund tag will tell you these are two emails unresolved. Both of them are assigned to either Rakesh and Yukta. If Yukta is on a day off today, you can search for the, I mean, pick this email up and reassign it to Rakesh because he's working today, so you can go ahead and transfer the ownership to this email without forwarding these emails. And now, in my section, I've got these seven emails to work on, and that's how you can manage the complete visibility of the inbox.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Okay. And this is also assigned by hiver.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It could be auto assigned, which is why I would just keep myself away and all the new emails will either go to the unassigned or whoever is available. I can say either Rakesh gets the email or if he's offline because he's away, hiver can route the email to the next person you choose to.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. For example, if a customer is very, not happy and he writes like something I want a refund, is hiver, auto assigning like a refund? Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Absolutely. You can do that from the admin panel. When you go into the shared inbox for your info or Berlin inbox in the automations, workflow, you can create an automation workflow, emails assigned basis on subject. Let's say if a subject says something to do with refunds?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Or if it contains the body of the email that also talks something to do with refunds. As long as the email talks about these variables, you can go ahead and say, assign these emails by default to Rakesh because he'll be the person dealing with the refunds. So you can choose to do, I mean automation also?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I want to take a quick pause and understand, is this something that you're looking to achieve with hiver, are you looking at this sort of solution?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yes. It's very interesting. It's also interesting that it's like works in our… it's like with Gmail. So it's not a complete new thing. You know, it's easily implemented. Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's the idea. Yeah, that's the idea that your team is not learning a new system. It's a plug and play very easy to set up. I have teams onboarded on hiver in no more than two days at all. So you don't have to go through a long learning curve at all. So, I'm not learning a new system at all. It's not complicated. It's very easy.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  And like you also probably have like analytics, yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes. Under the reports and analytics, you could absolutely see how many emails you're receiving, how soon we are working on it, what category of emails do we deal with? How many active new result emails you have in the support? You can go ahead and say, can I check?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Like which employee for example, is not replying fast?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Huh. Under the user report, you could see emails assigned versus emails sent out of these users. And if you go to the user dashboard, let's say, Rakesh, in last 90 days, he got these many emails. He only worked upon 26, and this is his performance report.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yes. And can I customize the report? For example, I want to see how much emails he didn't reply at all?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Huh. You can customize the report. You can create a new report on the basis of new conversations which are assigned to a specific representative. Let's say Rakesh and the ones where he has not been able to resolve, let's say all the ones which are pending and open. You can customize the reports for yourself, absolutely.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And on top of it, even when you're working on these support emails, you've got custom fields where you could absolutely go ahead and solve these emails on basis of what is the email priority. It's low. What is the email type? It's type, issue one two three. Now, anything which is important, you can even capture the important information from the customer or if this email is about anything to do with it. So you could go ahead and for an example, I'm looking at this email, I open this one up. So you have the options to use these customized fields, yeah, which will be more beneficial for you to look at if it's a VIP customer regular. So this is a customization data where you could use it to say this is a building number a B. C, is this a high priority emails? If you want to have a maybe follow up date to the customers, you can use a date range for an example. If I take you to the info inbox, maybe a different inbox, and you look at the email here. So this is a different setup altogether. So you see this priority of the email request, right? So you have got ticket request, one, two, three four five. All of that is possible.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any other communication channel along with the emails that you're looking to solve?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  We also use telegram a lot.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. We don't integrate with telegram at the moment, but is that something very important for you?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  No, I also, I already have like a different solution. I did myself a solution so that's not, it's not important for this one for the subject. Okay? Or like I think we have like a lot of construction sites. So is there also a way to show which?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Construction site? This email is about?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Exactly which construction sites?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I can absolutely do that to you. Let me show that to you. When I go into the admin panel with the setup, I go to my Berlin inbox, and I look at the custom fields. And from here, I can actually set up a custom field for an example. I would say I create a new field for construction site.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then I say this is site a, this is site B. So however you want to give it, right?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And this all is going to be now visible on the top screen for you. Now, when you're working on any of those emails, let's say I pick this email up about a customer request, and I'm working on this email. So this actually gives me an option. Which site is this about?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Okay. No, but that's not what I meant because it was like, for example, I have, yeah, but I don't think it's really like I'm thinking of a tool that shows, but it's not the email thing actually, it's like a dashboard that shows me the construction sites and then it shows me the emails to the construction sites, but it's a bit.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, if you're looking to look at all the emails for construction site, one, I would want to understand, do we have a common inbox email for construction site one?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  We have a common, like common phrases. So, for like a customer writes, for example, this was also talking about emerging email threats, you know, because normally, like the customer, for example, in this street, he has water damage. And then it takes about half a year, you know, first you have to check where the damage comes from. So you have to divide and you have to with the relations teams, you know, you have different processes and lots of mails. Okay. And I'm looking like a dashboard that shows me the construction sites and all emails to construction sites, and then a summarization, like an AI summarization which problems occur to construction sites who was not happy or something like this.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Unfortunately, that is not how the hiver dashboards are designed. What hiver dashboards can do for you is when you create the dashboards, it can actually help you still look at these emails. Let's say you want to find out Simon's dashboard, and it would still let you know the reports on these parameters. But these are not the custom sites by the way because these sites are not on basis of the shared mailboxes. So you still have sales at the rate and Berlin at the rate or info at the rate. But if these construction sites have a very specific email, then you can see these emails into the construction site, one two, three four, like these become a shared inbox for the team. But that's not the case in hiver, what you can at max do is under the inbox, which is Berlin or support for you or info. At the rate, you can create a view for construction sites. For an example, any email that has been done by any of your users, either these are open pending or closed emails, but you're looking at a construction site one. So you can look at these emails which are about construction site one, you create a view and you would say this is a site one email. So you can see, you don't want to look at the pending emails, but you want to look at these emails which are site one. So you could just keep this view on the top and you would see these are the site one emails for you.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But that's not dashboard. It's like you're sorting and you're creating a view for your specific email. Yeah, but that's not dashboard.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. But it's also not what we're looking for because like creating a specific site, it should have, it should be created automatically because, I can't create a site which I don't know about. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Ah, okay. So you're not aware of different sites you're saying as an email receive in your inbox, it should automatically understand which site it is coming in from, and it should create a quick tag as per the site.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Exactly. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We can do automatic tagging, but I'm not sure. Okay. Let me show you first of all, in the admin side. When I turn on the AI, hiver can automatically tag the emails, appropriate tags, right? So hiver can understand this email is from site a, site B, site three.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And it can tag the emails. But when you're looking at the sites, you would still create the views for yourself with the tags.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  The views that's okay. The problem is like the only problem is I can't write site a site B because we have lots of sites every day. There are new sites. And the big challenge right now is exactly seeing which at which sites there are problems or like which are the, because like the QM team, the quality management isn't into the daily business. You know, they are only checking the problem, the problematical sites. So the like what you wrote, like site one, site, two, site three, this has to be done automatically. These would.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  be done automatically by hiver tags then not the custom of views. So hiver can tag. Yeah. And then.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  hiver writes creates a tag and adds.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  a tag and then under the tags option, you can just simply go ahead and search for a site name. Yeah. And then it will pull the emails about that site.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's possible. Yeah, but it's not the dashboard. It's still the email sorting in the views here.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay. No, but that's fine. That's fine. Then I can have a summarization of these of all the emails connected with these tags.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And then in the analytics, you can go ahead and look at the emails about the tags, also for the different sites. For an example, I'll show you when I'm into the info or Berlin inbox under the tags, I can see the emails about these different sites.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay. Is there a way to export the analyzation?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can do a new export in the CSV and you've got export with the different variables here. And this could be different sites also with the tags. Yeah.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yep.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Because I'm also thinking it's not mandatory. It's just a thought of mine because I have a tool I made myself like which like you do with GMS, like it does with our telegram chats, you know, it exports automatically telegram chats, and also does analyzation and I'm thinking how to connect them, you know, how to connect because the email is the correspondation to our customer and our telegram is the communication to our construction site to our people on site. Okay? And so if I can, yeah, you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Could get the exports and then with the export, you can, probably, you know, do anything that you want post it.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay. But I think I got that. So, yeah. So interesting.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, is this something that is in trust or does it still? Yes.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Definitely. No, definitely. It's very interesting. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And with regards to the pricing, now, when we're looking at hybrid packages, we have got free package. We have got growth at 25 dollars, pro at 45 dollars. And elite now, if you're looking at download of reports and exports of reports with certain automations, we are looking at a pro plan for 45 dollars per login. And if you're a team of six people managing the Berlin at the rate inbox and info inbox, we are looking at this plan for you which is 45 dollars per login multiplied by six people. So instead of six, we do buckets of 10. So you have the two user license then five, and then 10 1,520. So we're looking at 45 multiplied by 10 users.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay. And the… question is,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  you can start with five.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay. So you have like buckets of five? Okay. Yeah, that's the thing is, do I need an account for everyone using Gmail or do I only need the account for the one doing the quality control?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Only the ones who are using hiver to work on these emails, for info inbox. Yeah, you don't need account for all the Gmail users in your company, you may have 300 people or you may have 30 people, but you don't need hiver account for everyone, you only need hiver account for the ones who are going to be working on hiver Gmail, and they need to install hiver account extension.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So how many total users then you're looking at?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  I think 30… I'm not sure, but I think like because like shopping hiver, it's very practical for the people who are responding to the emails, you know, who are doing the daily business. So like also the sentiment analysis and also doing like the correspondation like between the emails, like I think it's very like a nice tool, you know, to chat to the email about all of the customers over email. Like it's very practical, but I think it's like then it's for everyone using Gmail, and then the dashboards that's the thing that I would use like for the quality control.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  For dashboards, you're going to be the administrator. So you can always be an admin and people would not have access to dashboards except yourself or somebody who would make an administrator. So, yeah, I mean, if you're looking at 30 users, are you saying three zero 30 users total? Yeah.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  We are looking.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  At a volume discount for you? Because this is a pricing for our website, like when you have a team of five people, 10 people. But if you're looking at 30 people, then we're looking at a customized pricing for yourself. Okay? Like it could be something like 35 dollars instead of 45. So I can go ahead and say I can do 20 or 30 percent discount. I would check for the month of November, how much we can do, but we are looking at a volume discount for you for 30 users.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any specific budget that you have in place today?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  No, I didn't really thought about budget yet. I first like thought about the tool and you have like a free trial. Yes, I can check it like for a week or something.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can set it up and you can invite your number of people, maybe all 30 mates.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  There's no limitation to the trial. I can send you a guide on how to set it up. If you want assistance. I can even help you set up your trial also.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. Okay. But that looked to me very intuitive. So, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I can go ahead and send you the information on how you can go ahead and set it up, set up a trial. Yeah. And then Simon, maybe you can invite your teammates and do you think by next week, we could reconnect and understand if this makes sense? And we can push this internally to your management. What do you think?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yes. Let me check it also myself. Also, I'm checking some other tools, you know, I just started. So, yeah, let me check it a bit.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. What other tools are you checking at the moment? I can help you with a guide, maybe comparison amongst all of that. I'm.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  also like I'm looking at Zendesk.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  And the fourth one, I forgot the name. Yeah, I'm not sure check.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  I think Freshdesk or something like this?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, the difference here is both Zendesk and Freshdesk are expensive tools. Number one, number two, these are not right inside Gmail, like you're saying it's not easy to use. You really need a lot of time to set it up. You need time to learn the system. Ours is very easy right inside Gmail plug and go need zero learning curve and we provide 24 seven support. Be it, you know, onboarding support, setting up the account, onboarding, your team training, no extra cost at all. But with Zendesk or tools like Freshdesk, where you are still spending a lot of time training team. And I'm yet to find out other solution that does 24 seven support. I don't think Zendesk does.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah, yeah, no, I honestly, I'm really like prestige's tool, you know, because that's the way like I said, I'm looking right now, I'm looking for a small tool. I'm not looking for a big tool like a big CRM tool. And it actually looks like, let me just like test a bit. You know, I will like implement like test it for a week. Sure. And yeah, let's talk in a week about it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you want me to help you with the testing or setup or would you be able to take care of it by yourself?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Let me first try it by myself, okay?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Because it's easier for me at times, you know, because now of like doing today doing like operation and like in the night, I'm already doing absolutely. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. Can we go ahead and catch up by Thursday in about two or three days? And by then, if you are able to set up the test account, you're happy. I can take care of questions and anything in case you need assistance, I can help you with the setup on Thursday, then can I maybe do a 15 minute quick catch up call with you?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah, sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And I'm looking at the same timing on Thursday, if that's okay. Can you check your calendar?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  It's a bit difficult. Let's do, maybe, can you do like in the maybe three o'clock like my time?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me check that. Sure. Let me check my calendar.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  I don't know what's.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I've got a meeting at three three 34, but I can do five actually.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Five.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Or four 30? Let me check four 34. Give me a minute.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Maybe a bit earlier.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Like I can do four o'clock with you. Can I four o'clock.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  four o'clock yeah. Yeah, that's fine.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. We just need 15 minutes to quickly sync and understand where do we stand today? And if you're able to set up the trial, well and good, if not, I can help you with that. So, I'll keep a quick 15 minutes of a quick feedback meeting on Thursday for four o.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  'clock yeah. All right. On Friday on Friday, yes?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. I'm sending you an invite for four. Yeah. And also, I will send you the quick guide to refer to on how soon you can set it up. It's a very simple straightforward process. You simply need to be a part of your Gmail inbox. You log in into Gmail, and then you set up hiver on your personal inbox, I'll send you all the details and you have to have an access to your info at the rate inbox and Berlin inbox that you want to set up, invite your teammates to hiver, and everybody will start to log in into their individual Gmail and work on these common inboxes from one Gmail interface. I'll send you a quick guide and if you need any assistance, you can feel free to write back to me please.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah. All right. Thank you. All right. I will now talk also with my business partner. She's normally, the thing is she's much more into the process I'm just doing because she's right now, like I told you with her child. I'm also talking with her. I'm really impressed. I will talk with her and tell her if she has some thoughts about it and then we can let's speak on Friday. I will try to set it up and then we can, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Yeah, the meeting is already set up for Thursday. Yeah.

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Thursday is fine.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. Simon. Thank you for your time. I look forward to talking to you again. Yeah?

Simon Buslovich (simon.buslovich@trocknerheld.de):
  Yeah, thank you very much. Bye bye you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Take care. Bye bye.
