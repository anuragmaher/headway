================================================================================

Angela:
  hi, Jeevan. Hi, Linda.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hi, Angela. Can you hear me okay?

Angela:
  Yes.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hi, Angela. I'm not sure whether you remember, but the last time you spoke to hiver, I think you and I had a like a brief chat back then, but it's good to sort of connect again.

Angela:
  Yes, it is. It's really good to connect again. I'm looking forward to seeing what has changed with hiver since we last spoke.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I'm sorry, I think I didn't catch the second half of your sentence. I'm sorry?

Angela:
  I said, I'm looking forward to seeing what's changed with hiver since we last spoke.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I'm looking forward to showing you as well. I think Steve and I, we met midway through October. I think for a fairly substantial conversation and we spoke about hiver capabilities, sort of the improvements we've made since you and I last spoke Angela. So yeah, definitely keen to… sort of present that to the team here as well. I think I see we have Linda and Jennifer here. Are we waiting for Steve?

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  I don't know Angela's was.

Angela:
  Steve, he was going to be on it.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  I'll slack him.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  In the meantime, Jennifer, Linda, nice to meet the both of you. My name is Jeevan. I currently lead the sales team here at hiver. I've been with the business for a few years, which is why when Angela looked at us considered us a couple of years ago, I was their point of contact. I've since moved to a sort of a leadership role with the company, but… since I had context and since I've sort of like spoke this interacted with the team before. I thought, okay, it's good for me to jump in so that you all don't have to go over some of the details again because I remember I had notes from our last interaction about sort of maybe some of the challenges with Zendesk that the team was facing. So, which is why I wanted to make sure that I was the one sort of stepping in and I will continue to be a point of contact through this evaluation?

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Perfect. Good to meet you.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Likewise.

Angela:
  Steve, are you?

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  In there?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  I'm in here.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Okay.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Sorry, I'm late how's it going?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Good. Hi, Steve. Nice to see you again. No, we were just doing a quick round of introductions. I just introduced myself to the team. Do we have a full house?

Angela:
  Oh, I think.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Is.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Angela here?

Angela:
  Yes, I'm here barely.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Oh… hope you're feeling better soon. That sounds rough?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yes, thank you. Yeah, I will make sure that we make this as productive as possible since Angela's sort of braved some condition to be on this with us. So I'm going to make this as productive as possible. So I had a quick agenda, Steve, feel free to let me know if you wanted me to cover anything in specific, but I'd love to sort of show you how some of our other customers are using hiver as a help desk as their ticketing system and what it might do differently to then what you're used to right now. I'm happy to answer any questions about specific workflows or scenarios that you'd like to cover. And of course, questions along the way, so that's typically what I had in mind. Steve, does that sound okay? Anything you wanted me to specifically cover?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  No, I think that sounds great. We'll let you kind of lead the way, you know, the system best. But yeah, this is really for Linda and Jennifer and I think Angela's you know, seen this a little bit in the past, but for them, they're the, you know, their roles. So they're the ones who use Zendesk the most. And so I really will, you know, kind of turn to them to ask you questions and see what they might want to dive into in more detail.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Keep the questions coming. I'm happy to sort of like we don't need to go in one flow. I'm happy to sort of jump around if that's easier. So… I'm just going to share my screen. I'm just going to get rid of some… of my tabs here. Give me a sec… too many tabs.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So I hope everyone can see my screen. So ladies and gentlemen with hiver, Angela might remember this specific item from way before we are a ticketing system that is built into Gmail. Right? What we wanted to do is when an email comes into your business, it gets transferred to a ticketing system, gets converted to a ticket, and you have to go into that ticketing system, deal with all the constraints that it comes with and resolve the ticket from there. Instead, all we tried to do is eliminate a few of these unnecessary steps in the middle, leave the emails as emails and bring the ticketing system to you, right? So instead of you logging in or accessing a third party software with hiver, you just access your inbox that you log into anyway every day. So, Linda, for example, you log into Linda at efulfillment and all the emails that are sent to you, those stay private. Just because hiver is in here, doesn't mean that those change at all, those stay private. Those go into your inbox over there on the left… where hiver kicks in, is below the inbox, you will see that there are a list of yellow colored sections. So these are all powered by hiver. And for the sake of our call, today, we're going to be focusing on finance operations and support. These three folders are what we call shared inboxes. Each of these three folders are connected to a particular email address. So I remember Steve, correct me if I'm wrong, the last time we spoke, I think there was a support at efulfillment, email address, right? So you connect that to just this folder. And then each, everyone on the team, how many ever people required? We've got people. We've got customers with 300 people accessing a single folder. So how many ever people are required? They just simply get access to that folder by being a participant on hiver. And once they get access to that folder, all the emails sent to your support at efulfillment will just come sit in this little dedicated folder over here on the left, right? So that is your way of accessing it once you access all of the functionality kicks in. But before I jump from access to functionality and features, any questions so far?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  And you have the ability. So if you had, if we had seven people, let's say that access this support folder. Does hiver have the ability to say, you know, you can limit permissions to say who can sort of assign it to a different folder or a different team member? Like, so everybody can view it, but how many people can do whatever they want with it?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We do have roles. We have four different roles and permissions, Dave. And if you want to restrict specific items that make sense for your team, we can help you create custom roles as well. But we've got four roles which have different levels of permissions. We've got member that does day to day access. Then we've got supervisor, then we've got a mailbox admin, and then we've got a super admin. So we've got four different roles that you can use. Yes. Okay.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Jennifer, Linda, do you have any other questions about that and permissions or?

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  So, like when a customer would write in, it… would be connected to hiver and all those emails would go right into that support folder. Yes, correct. Yes. So say it was myself and Jennifer and the customer service team. I guess, how would you, when you say an admin role? I think that's what you said. Sure. I'm just trying to understand like the flow, you know what I mean? Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, perfect. We'll get to the we're going to jump into the flow, right? That's it. So right now, it's only about the change in the way you access these tickets. They're no longer going to be in a third platform. They're just going to come in here. So only thing that you're going to be able to do as a team is access it from here. Okay? Once you access it or once you access, once you open up a new, you see a new ticket in there, there is a flow that you are used to, right? So let's say this is my new open ticket that has come in. I am able to see this new open ticket that comes into a section called unassigned. So the first thing that happens is when an email hits hiver, this is optional. Of course, you can switch it off. But by default, the first thing that we do is our AI runs on it, right? Our AI runs on it and our AI will do, and the focus of our AI is not to do anything fancy. We're trying to sort of understand how your team works. And so for example, if a new open ticket comes in and gets to assign to this person categorized in this folder. So we try to understand what your processes are complete, as many of those processes as possible. So that when the person who's actually assigned to the ticket gets to that ticket and gets their eyes on it, all of these sort of admin tasks are automatically completed. And all you have to do is just step in and take over and that's the flow that we're going to be talking about for the next 20 minutes… right? So going back to step one, which is our AI first kicks in and we process that email. Now, some of the things that our AI does is it essentially detects sentiment, right? So it will tell you that whether there is a frustrated conversation somewhere or there's a really happy conversation somewhere and we're able to tell you. And for example, I'm sure the both of you, the second you hear the word frustrated interaction or a frustrated ticket, you want to know how you can escalate that or like put it in front of the right people. So we can help you set up escalation or workflows like that as well. And that's the whole point of it. And I'm going to show you how you can do those workflows or an example of that in just a second. But let me open this ticket first, right? So by the time I open this ticket, I know what tone it's in. And what our AI also puts it into the right tags or categories or folders or whatever your team uses. So we can automatically apply tags like these. So in this case, hiver's AI tells me that this is a billing related query. So it says, I have a question relating to my invoice. It shows that I've only paid three users whereas I have five active in my account. Could you please clarify now hiver's, AI detects, it will apply the billing tag on it. And it'll actually give you a reason why it's doing so because if you think it's wrong, you should be able to report it and so it will be learned from it. So we can sort of do that as well. And then what it also can do is it can automatically assign it to the right people. So you can set up workflows that say, if an email comes in from this client, it needs to go to this rep or if it comes in about this topic, let's say all my returns need to go to the returns folder and it should go to the rep that handles returns, all of those kind of workflows you can set up. But essentially what that workflow does is it assigns this ticket to someone. I'm going to do this manually. But typically it will be done automatically. So I'm going to assign this to Alex. And the second I assign this to Alex or the workflow, does it that activity is now logged and timestamped. So by the time Alex sees that ticket, Alex will see it in his mind section. So the mind section is really helpful because it gives me a list of all the open tickets currently under my responsibility, I can come into the mind section, see that these are my two emails. If I have slas running on it, which I assume that you do, I actually see the status of the SLA as a banner right here. So if I were in Alex's shoes, I could have opened my laptop 30 seconds ago. I'll come into work. I see the two tickets assigned to me. I see all the tags that it's been assigned automatically. I can see the sentiment. I can see how much time I have remaining to respond and all of that information is right there. And all I have to do is hit on, click on it, open it and reply.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  I'll hit.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Pause. Again. I don't know if we spoke about a few different things. Any questions?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Yeah, this looks pretty neat. I guess in terms of the automatic assignment with your example, you know, I guess worst case, it gets assigned to the wrong person and they figure that out. But obviously an email might be talking about billing along with something else and something else. I mean, how does the AI, you know in terms of its level of confidence to automatically assign something?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you can definitely set up rules and guidelines to make to help it sort of ascertain it as well. So when I, what I say, what I mean by that is, for example, if I were to go into the admin panel very quickly, there are a lot of different options that you can take. For example, you want to give us some relationship mapping, right? Saying, hey, I want to assign all billing related queries to this person. So you can, if you want to give us just mappings, it's very simple. It's just a simple three by three column. You want to give us mapping like, this is something that we can use to train the AI or train our workflows. And we can also help you, for example, let me just go back one second, go into the shared inboxes, go into support, which is what we were working on. So I'm going to click on automations, which is where our workflow builder is. So our workflow builder is meant to take care of these scenarios. So let me give you an example. So I have a negative sentiment leadership escalation scenario. I think so if I click on edit just to show you what that looks like. So this workflow, what it does is it says AI sentiment is updated, whenever the AI sentiment is updated as negative or very negative. So whenever you have a negative ticket or an interaction in your workflow, you can automatically send a reply that says, I'm sorry to hear that your recent experiences haven't been ideal. My name is Jeevan and I lead customer support. We are fully committing, yada. Yada. You can actually automatically send this email out from a supervisor, automatically assign it to the supervisor. Like I have done, and add a tag that says escalation. So all of this can be done before a human being even gets in front of that ticket.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Nice. And as part of the setup process, Jeevan, to what extent do we get assistance with this kind of setup? I mean, can we pay? Is it like we could do it all on our own if we don't there's no cost to that. If we wanted your support, getting all this set up to begin with?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We will assist you every step of the way. So if you want to test some of this out pre like in your evaluation before we enter a partnership, we help you with our pre sale and onboarding team that's again available to you at no additional cost. Once you, we do enter into a partnership and you are onboarding full time, you get a dedicated success manager. Again, no additional cost. What you, it's part of your subscription, whichever package you pick. And they will be with you to help you set all of this up, scope out all of this. They'll send you sort of a questionnaire earlier about what kind of workflows that you want, so that they come in prepared and they can actually help you set it up.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Great, Jennifer, are we using any automated assignments right now?

Jennifer Robinson (jlr@efulfillmentservice.com):
  No.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Okay.

Jennifer Robinson (jlr@efulfillmentservice.com):
  I mean, not where it automatically goes there. We have to tell it to go there.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Right. Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. So you can definitely do that with hiver as well. So, for example, you want to create one from scratch and say when a new conversation comes in, and if the, I want to create an automation that says, if there is a keyword called billing in the subject or the body of the email. So I want to say billing, this is just an example. I want this to automatically assign among the three people on the team that take care of billing queries. So what I can do is I can create an action that says assign among three people or even one person you can, but I'll say three people. So I'm going to say Cole, Alex and myself and I can either distribute it among these three people based on equal loads or just a round Robin, whatever you need. So it can go to even if you have 70 people on the company, all billing queries will only go through those three people. So we can set up rules like that.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Nice, right? So the assignment can be done in as you can tell a lot of different ways. If you want to take that stuff, you want to take sort of thing out of it and you want to do it in shifts and whoever is in shift at the time, you want to automatically assign it to them, you can do a round Robin, just a general round Robin. Of course, you want to exclude yourself, you want to exclude Linda, Jennifer, Angela. So you can exclude people from it, but the rest of the members, if they are available in, they're marked available, they are available for the queue and they will continue to get tickets as they come back. So different ways that you can do it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So going back to our example, let's say that I am in my mine section.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Right. I am in my mine section. I'm just going to assign this back to me. Okay? So I'm in my mine section, I am going to be, I've come in here. I see exactly how much time I have left. I see what the email is about and I want to. So all of these admin tasks are done. The only thing remaining for me is replying. Now when replying to the email, we really want to make things easier. So when I click reply, you have two options. Option number one is being able to use our templates. Now, our templates are macros or canned responses that you might have seen. They are a team wide resource. One person creates it. Everyone else can use it. And when they create it, they can use simple things like for example, I'm going to use this email. And in this email, I'm going to it's going to ask me two things. I'm going to fill in the blanks. I'm going to say, Linda, I tried reaching you at 1,111 insert template. And that email gets added in here. Right now. If you notice this template or whatever I might have typed this out, this has a small little like it's got a little bit of a spelling error. It's not got a full stop here. So it's not like the best written email. But if I have a rough draft thrown in there, we've got our AI compose button right here to fix grammar, improve writing automatically. You can just type in rough draft, click improve writing. It'll take your rough draft, keep the essence and it'll improve the way it is phrased and punctuated and everything. And then you can add it in there. And I'm just going to, yeah. So that's what it, so it gives you a full proper version. So I can click accept and that gets added in here. Again, this is very like rudimentary straightforward. We actually want to help you one step further which is being able to click on this button. And this is our co pilot. So this is our biggest version of our AI beyond all the other ones. What the importance of this co pilot is, what it signifies, is that the ability for you to let us know what you want to train the AI on, so you can come in and feed it documents, feed it like PDFS that it learns from technical information, buyer, information, seller, information, whatever that is. And based on all that it learns from, it also learns from by the way actual conversations that your team is having. So actual ticket resolutions, it learns from. And based on all of that, if you wanted to come. In here and click draft a reply. It will actually read the email in front of you, draft a full reply or give you three options of what that reply does again based on what it's learned from. So, in this case, it will say request clarification, ask for implementation timeline, propose a live demo. I want to propose a live demo because that's what we want to do. I want to say just, I want to just say number three when I hit number three, a fully contextual conversation that makes sense for your business is created based on what it's learned from, right? And it'll literally ask it very pointed questions or it'll give it very pointed information and you can simply click insert and edit it and send it out. Let's see if that will wrap it up.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Is this, is this your own platform or did you build this on like a using chatgpt?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Steve, I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. Can you say that again?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  I was wondering, if you're you built this AI on chatgpt or which platform? Just curious?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Gpt five. Yeah. Gpt five. Okay. Yeah, we just in fact went migrated on off just gpt four, four o to gpt five earlier this week. Oh, okay. Nice. Yeah. In fact, openai is a customer of ours. I think they're four of their business departments are using hiver right now. So, yeah. So that was a nice little partnership that we had both ways.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Any questions… for?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Me?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sure. Okay. Let's get, I just want to like close the loop, right? So we spoke about ticket coming in, assignment, categorization management. And then up until reply, the final piece is how do you resolve or how do you track progress of a ticket? So we have a very simple system. We've got open pending and close. We have three statuses. You can of course have custom statuses if you'd like as a custom field below. I have a custom field that says priority. So similarly, you can have something like for statuses. But these are our standard ones because this ties into analytics which I'm going to dive into next. So with our statuses, what you are able to do is track progress. So when a ticket comes in by default, it goes to open. From there, it can go to pending or close based on the progress. And… the way these statuses help is the way it ties into this left panel, right? And I'm going to show you the left panel in a second… unassigned mine and team, which we are going into these three sections that we spoke about. They only contain open tickets. So the second a ticket stops being open, it goes away from unassigned mine or team and it doesn't disappear, it just goes into a standalone folder for pending and closed, right? And of course, if a ticket gets a new response from someone hiver, detects a new response comes in and brings it back to open unless they're saying, thank you. In which case, our AI will just like not open it back up and it'll keep it closed… right?

Angela:
  That's cool.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Does this work with like within Gmail, you know, you can just search for an email address in your search bar, and it'll pull up every single email you've ever had with that email address. Is that going to work the same way here? If I want to look at a full history?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So, the search bar on top is all inclusive. It includes your inbox, it includes your support tickets, all of it. Okay. We are a certified Google partner. So, which means that all of these Google functionality overlap with us as well.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  And I think during our initial quick demo, Jeevan, you had shared, how, if I wanted to just add an internal note, I think to somebody, I don't know if that was assigning it to them. I see over there on the right side.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So you're also able to go in here and leave notes for each other. For example, if I want to make sure that Cole does not want to take this, I'm going to say, hey, Cole. Hey, Cole. You… sure you got this? And then I click done, then Cole will get notified. He can come back reply. It will be a completely internal conversation. I can also if you are using other third party systems, right? I'm not sure whether the team is actively referring to maybe a Netsuite or does… the team use any other major third party systems outside ticketing?

Angela:
  Yeah, we use happyfax. Happyfax chat.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay. So that's interesting. We can definitely talk about chat as well because that's something we offer to part of our process, part of our product. But essentially, what I was talking about is sort of some, for example, if you're using something like a Netsuite or a CRM, we actually have integrations that tie straight into those and we can bring information from there. But what I wanted to focus on for a second is the team section, right? Because when my customers and we have, we do have a lot of customers flipping over from Zendesk. And when they ask me what is the first major difference or the first thing that you'd notice between the two softwares? I'm not even going to talk about features, right? It's just one piece structural piece in Zendesk. When you want to go in and see everyone's open tickets, you click on a similar section like this and then you have to open new tabs for each of the people. If I'm not mistaken with hiver, we've kept everything in one space. It's all built in here. So, for example, I want to see how many open tickets Rakesh has got. He's got four. I click on his name. These are his four tickets. I can open any of them. I can see all the back and forth that has been exchanged on that ticket. So in case Rakesh has called in sick super last minute, hasn't given anyone a heads up. Hasn't had a chance to let us. He just called in sick. I don't need Rakesh for context. I can simply come here, click on his name, see his open tickets, open them, see all the back and forth that has been exchanged. I don't need to be cc'd. I can step in and take over. I'm from Rakesh. If I want to see Cole, I click on Cole's name. These are all Cole's emails. And if I want to click on for example, my name, these are all my open emails, open tickets.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  That's cool.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Before I do want to jump into reports and analytics for just a second. But before that, anything else we want to do before or can I jump in?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Yeah. Before we jump into that, I think, Linda, Jennifer, you're obviously an angel I'm most familiar with Zendesk and how you're using it day to day. I mean, now's the chance to kind of bring up any before we get into actual analytics because I don't think, you know, that that's secondary, but I'm interested in that. But, now's the chance to bring up to Jeevan, what, what are any concerns you have? Or, you know, what are you wanting to see more of or what does Zendesk do that you like that you haven't seen demonstrated here that hiver can, do, you know, any concerns that you have?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Gaps concerns? Happy to address them?

Angela:
  I have a question. Steve, would the sales team be using this then too?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  No, not, I don't plan on that. I mean, I don't not right away anyway.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay… sure.

Jennifer Robinson (jlr@efulfillmentservice.com):
  I really don't see a lot… of difference between Zendesk. I mean, obviously, the obvious differences, but as long as it works as you've said, I'm… I don't see a issue. It's just a lot to get used to.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Linda, do you have anything, not yet nope. And then, Nancy, maybe also before the analytics piece, because I think this would be a little more relevant to the team on the call. Jeevan would be the chat functionality. As Angela said, we use happyfox, it sort of integrates a little bit with Zendesk. But I don't think every conversation is going into that if I recall. And so, it's just another platform that's different. We've got Zendesk. We've got happyfox. We've got our sugarcrm, we've got slack. We've got, you know, Gmail. So this would be great if we could consolidate further.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So we do have a chat solution as well. And I'm going to show you what that looks like on the front end and then the right. So in addition to the chat solution, we also have a knowledge base that you can set up, right? We've actually created our own, our proper company, public facing knowledge base on our platform. And this is that knowledge base. This is on hiver that you can do, I'm just going to drop it into the chat. So if you want to open it and check it out, you can. And just to give you an example of what a test version of this looks like, we've actually created a test version for our demo instance, which is here just like very few little so maths folder and so on and so forth. And on this if you notice we've got a chat enabled. So this is what our chat looks like. So you've got home, you've got chat, you can start a conversation. You can also get help right here. And once you start a conversation, it can go through a decision tree. We are going to show you that decision tree right now. So I'm going to go to sales chat. You can set up decision trees like for example, chat bots, just give me a second.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, you can see chatbots like these. So you can create what you want happen when a query comes in? Which question do you want it to ask? How do you want that branch to go? So you can set all of this up. We are actually releasing as of the eighteenth of this month, we're releasing AI agents for here as well. So you can drop in an AI agent at one part of the chat. So it can actually respond to queries for you based on the co pilot that we spoke about. That's coming out on the eighteenth… talk. Again, I'll be able to sort of demonstrate that for you as well. But the key part here, ladies and gentlemen is the receiving end of this. We are the first tool in the market to build the receiving end into Gmail as well. So if you see sales chat right here, this is how this is where our chat is structured and this is how it works. So it temporarily converts your Gmail inbox… into a chat window like this, where you can receive, respond to chats.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You can use templates. You can use AI to respond to chats. You can assign it to each other, tag it, open it and middle of a chat if you wanted. Oh, I got a new email. I want to check it out. You can go back to your inbox check box if required, if you want to go in and see your open email tickets. You can check your open email tickets. Quickly jump back to your chat all in the same window.

Angela:
  That's awesome.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  And what about turning this? I don't even know if it's necessary to turn it into a more of a traditional ticket. Like this. Chat's gone far enough. I want to assign it to somebody as a, you know, get it out of the chat, get it into, you know, more of the support ticketing folder or whatever. How does that work? Or is that not, you just start a new ticket or?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because it has to be converted to an email. So typically, what we do, Steve is when once a chat is completed, it automatically goes to our support folder as a transcript and we just reply and that the transcript is sent to the customer as well. So the conversation is started. So we just go in and reply to that transcript so that the transcript is there for context as the first email and the follow up is the ticket that you are discussing.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Okay. And obviously we're ideally, you know, solving the issue right there in the chat, but sometimes it's like, hey, we got to get back.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Of course, of course.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Okay… cool.

Angela:
  I think that will help the customer service team.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  The chatbot just to confirm can be implemented on like we've got our own internal WMS system heavy foxes on there. So I assume we can just, we can implement that on any basically website we want.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Any website and it's super easy. Honestly, all you need to do is copy paste this little script into whichever website code you've got and that's it.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  It's as simple as that. So, yeah. So as you can tell, we've already got some version of our AI openers where you can, it can like respond to basic questions. But the next phase of that is our AI agents where it'll actually learn from the way your agents respond to queries and respond at least initially to help them out. So that's coming on eighteenth. And like I said, next time we, next time we chat, that will be available for us to demo.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We've already got agents with email. We're getting that with chat. Nice.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  All right. I guess, yeah, we could jump into the analytics piece for a few.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm going to, so since you said it's I'm just going to cover a couple of items before we get there. So two things that I know like every support team looks at is time sensitivity and customer satisfaction. So we spoke about how you can build workflows and everything. But below that you also have for time sensitivity, you can create SLA policies. You can have different SLA policies as you can tell we do. So essentially, you can trigger it on all conversations or specific conversations if you have different slas.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  But the crux is this which is if an email comes in and the first response is not done within two hours and a complete resolution is not done within 48. That's when you start letting people know, you can notify a signee, a signer and anybody else that you choose. And you can also give your team a heads up SLA, which is a due soon warning. So you can trigger, so let's say one hour, 30 minutes is the due soon, and 44 hours is the due soon. So you can trigger that as well. Right? So this sort of runs on the email.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And if you notice there was a little lightning bolt on the list that we spoke which I'll show you back in a second that's how our SLA sort of come in. And we also have customer satisfaction service that we allow you to send out, you can either send it on all replies just if you don't want a lot of customers say, hey, by the time a ticket is closed, people are not interested in giving a response. So we want to be able to send it out on every response. So you have that option manually. Nobody really chooses, but we've just got that for the sake of it, this is the most popular one that people use. It says automatically send a survey email after a ticket is closed. So, you can choose which one works best for you and you can use this to send out and gather information and this information rather much like all other pieces of metrics all go into a section here called analytics on the home page. So if you click on analytics very simple. I'm not going to go too deep into this if you, if we'd like to explore this further, we can. But as a very general overview, we have two types of metrics we give you workload, which tells you how much work your team is getting and we give you performance, which tells you how well your team is performing on that workload.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So workload tells you very simple metrics like number of active tickets in a particular time period. For me, it's the last 30 days, how many of these active conversations were new? Which means that they originated in the last 30 days and how many did we resolve? And if I scroll down, I get average first response time, general response time and resolution time… right? Which is telling you average of how much your team is taking to resolve a ticket. Now, this is as you can tell just average group numbers. You can drill them down or cut them down based on each agent or each user in the team. So if I scroll down, I get, I go to Yukta and these are Yukta's stats for the last 30 days.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So if I click on her name, I see everything Yukta has done. I can also drill it down by tags by slas. We just spoke about SLA, so we can drill it down by what is, how many violations that your team run into and what is their general compliance percentage, as you can tell. And then we also give you this is where all the seaside responses are captured. So you get number of seaside responses, you get sentiment responses. So you can see how many were very positive, how many were neutral? How many were negative, right? So you can see that here as well. This is not even based on customer replying. This is just based on our AI detecting tone. And of course you can put this all into custom reports. You can export it so on and so forth. So that's just a quick overview of the reports. And of course, happy to dig into that.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  With the slas, I'm curious, are you able? Are we able to assign a different SLA time based on a client or client's email for our VIP accounts of?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Course. So the way that would work is you give us a list of your VIP accounts. So, this is a great question Steve, because I'm just going to tell you give you this is an example of the kind of workflows we'll help you build. OK. So step one, you give us a list of your VIP clients, right? So we will store them in a table like this, create new object. And we store a list of your VIP clients. Now, whenever an email comes in from this, anyone in this list, we can automatically tag it with a tag that says VIP client. So that is done automatically because you've given us an association list. The way we would do that is go into automation and say create automation. And so when a new conversation comes in, if the condition is that if it comes from it… the email that it comes in from is present in this custom object and it comes in the client column. So whenever an email comes in and is present in the client column, I can automatically add a tag that says VIP… which I already have. And so this will be done automatically, right? So I'm going to click on save and enable and it is automatically saved and enabled. I'm just going to toggle it off for the time being. But you get the point right now. I can go to slas and say create SLA policy and say, whenever a VIP, whenever a conversation comes in with the VIP tag, I want to create a more stringent SLA on those emails. And so hiver, you don't even have to do anything. Hiver will automatically pick the SLA, it will apply it. So by the time it reaches an agent that SLA is already running.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Okay. Nice. And I can see it can be assigned to a certain person as well.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  You can definitely assign it to a certain person. Yeah.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Nice. Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Anything else? I think you asked the question you asked Jennifer? Steve was spot on that's the question I'm going to ask as well, which is any concerns gaps that you're seeing that we haven't addressed yet or scenarios that you don't see how it might play out? I'm happy to run through those?

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  I'm not seeing any right now, no.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  I think it looks great. Can you, we chatted a little?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Bit? I know there's probably a little bit of concern.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Or reservation around the migration process and I know we talked about it, Jeevan, can you elaborate on that for the whole team?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. So, yeah, like I said, we've got what we call internally a playbook for Zendesk migrations because we do this so often. So it's a, we typically tackle three phases. One is, how can we retain your data that you've had in Zendesk over all these years? How can we retain that? How can we bring that over with much of the rich context that is there with all your tags and your notes and everything? So we actually can do that. All we need is for you to generate a export file from Zendesk. It's as simple as XML file you give us that file. And that's all we need. We have the script to ingest it and recreate all of that context in hiver. So the historical context part, as you can tell, we've actually built specific capability to make that process really easy because it happens so often. The second piece is how can we map over the configuration? That is something that we will be very hands on with. We will understand if you want us to run us through how you do things in Zendesk right now. We're happy to sit and learn that as well and then come up with a plan on sort of migrating that over to hiver. And as you can tell, we've got very similar functionality that we're happy to do that. And the third is sort of transitioning the team. So the way that would work is we do two or three training sessions and make sure the team is brought up to speed. We decide a cutover date which is typically either over a lean period or a long weekend or something. We decide a cutover date the Thursday before the long weekend. They would stop using Zendesk or they would end using Zendesk at the end of the Thursday. And by the time they come in on Monday, they switch over to hiver and they're ready to do so because they're trained and everything. And over that long weekend, my support team will make sure that all of the routing and everything is taken care of. So that is typically how we structure it and how we've seen it be very structured, organized low impact in the past.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  And I know you have right now, I think you have, you know, hiver has like a help center that you sort of that we could put. So we're in the process of actually moving our help center from Zendesk to our own Wordpress website just to allow us more control and make it look better. And all that I guess Jennifer and Linda can better speak to like how, you know, well, we obviously have our support at email, but how our clients normally… initiating contact with us is that usually what it is, they're just going to their own email, whether it's Gmail or Microsoft. They're just plugging in a support at or do a lot of them initiate that on our support website or somewhere else? I'm just trying to think through like what is a client experience? How might that change on day one?

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  They, they, are you asking? I'm sorry?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Cause if they're only using the support at email for the most part, then I guess there's probably no change in the clients. They're just going to continue to use that, but.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Well, we have.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  They.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  can do it via email or they can do it via the dashboard. And I, we usually encourage clients to be logged into Zendesk. If they're doing it by email all the time. And this isn't Zendesk, what it will do is copy every single email response and the thing all in one. So it, you know what I'm saying? It's it's they'll send an email. It comes through as a question. You'll respond. They'll they'll answer via their email. It puts the whole conversation. So that's a little confusing. So, what I try to do is encourage them to be logged into Zendesk, or, you know, go create it from the dashboard, but it doesn't sound like this would be an issue with us because it would be, in the email already. I mean, it wouldn't be.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So we do remove that level of complexity with that. However, if you do want to have them have a dashboard where they can go in and technically actually submit a ticket, we've actually got a customer portal that you can set up similarly like you can, they can log into hiver, you can set up a form. You can see what their visibility settings are, like. You want to see, you want their users to only see their own requests. So you want to see, allow users to see all requests from their organization. And this is what this is what a typical portal would look like. And you can actually let me just log in here and you can actually just like embed this, in your website or anywhere and they can come in, log into our portal. You can put it, put your own graphics, your own logo into it, and they can also submit tickets from here,

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  But, but it would still come.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  In as an email.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  We would still get it as, in our inbox, like how we, okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  How you would get a normal email? Absolutely, your experience doesn't change for your customers. It's just about what they're used to or what their status quo is. We don't want to lift, make them change anything. So, yeah. So we give you both options. But in terms of coming in, it's just going to come in like a normal email from… the customer.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Linda, you made me when you were describing that, how clients operate, sometimes made me think about how we might have a client submit a ticket and they don't get a response in four minutes and then they submit another one. And so, is there an ability to sort of merge multiple tickets into one? Or?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So that's the one thing that Google actually restricts Steve, which is merging two email threads. Google does not allow. They, are, it's a big no, no with them. So we built our own functionality. So if you notice here, every conversation has a linked conversations tab. So you can't merge it because Google prevents it, but you can link it, which we allow.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Nice. Okay.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  We never have that. Steve, clients never create multiple tickets.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We use whatever Google gives us whatever they don't give us. We try to build it.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Yeah.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  All right. Well, this has been very helpful. Yeah. Thanks. I think I don't have other questions right now, anyone else?

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Are we going to be able to play with this?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Cause I usually don't have anything to do on Saturday night. So, no, we're going to, we're going to have, I mean, this is kind of what this is about as a demo. And then we can go in and just… you know, experiment and things like that. So, what.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  we do is some, just to help with just this Linda where you can play with it without really connecting any of your actual customer emails or anything. So, what we end up doing is we actually have, like.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  a sandbox,

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  exactly. So we, if you create a trial driver, which I can help you do right now, you don't have to connect any of, your support email or anything like that. We create what is called a demo inbox and load them up with some fake emails about missing coffees and stuff, which you can use to play around and assign and do all sorts of things. And it's not real world email. So you can just go on, yeah, yeah.

Linda Sorna (linda@efulfillmentservice.com):
  That's what I meant. Yeah.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we definitely.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  That'd be cool. Yeah, I can't remember if there was a time limit on that demo period. Do you, even, obviously, we want to make sure that whenever we initiate that we, you know, we're setting aside some time to actually get in the tool and mess around with it.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  There is a time period but we'll make sure that given that this has been so many years in the making, we don't want trial periods and stuff like that, to come in the way of an evaluation. So I'll make sure that you've got an extended trial period. No problem. We don't have to worry about it expiring for the time being. Okay. Thank you. So when do you want to kick that off? I'm happy to sort of send that sign… up link across to you, and… via email, to the group here at the end of the call. And so you, one of you can just sign up and invite everybody else, don't connect a shared inbox. So you don't have to connect any of your emails. You just get a demo inbox in there. So, yeah. So that's something that I definitely want to check but, yeah, you let me know, what works best?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Yeah, you can just send it around to everybody and we'll coordinate on, who kicks it off and then invite others. And if there's obviously four of us on the call, but we have others on our team and there's no limit. If Jennifer and Linda wanted to invite a couple of people.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  No limits, setup takes literally and I will guarantee this five minutes.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Okay.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So, it'll take literally five minutes for you to get set up and invite people. Of course, it'll take longer when your support inbox comes into the picture because we're scoping that out and implementing stuff. But with the, just for the demo inbox five minutes stops… cool.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Perfect.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  So I'll have that sent over to the group here at the end of the call, in terms of next steps, Steve, what do you, what do you recommend as next steps? I don't want to get in touch before we're ready. I know we've got a tentative plan if everything works out, but, what does that look like for you?

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Yeah, I think, so we're heading into our peak season. Now, we're just a couple of weeks from black Friday. So, you know, our team is going to get pretty busy, but, you know, so that's why I was asking about the time period cause I don't you know, we're we'll be able to get in there, but it might be a little bit sporadic, over the next few weeks, but, you know, our timeline with Zendesk is a renewal and what late February, early March.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  So, and like you said, we want to give ourselves plenty of time, if we all feel comfortable and want to, do, want to make this transition and have, and I think you recommended both platforms be live for probably a couple of weeks. So, yeah, I mean, I'd like to be in a position by end of next month, internally to be able to say kind of yay or nay, and then kick off, the next step in terms of migration, early in the 20 26, if we move forward.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Sounds good. So here's what I'd say, I'm I will, of course, I understand thanksgiving is coming up just like a week and a half away. So, I will sort of maybe just send you at some tentative time for the first week of December. Of course, we can reschedule or push that out as required but I just want to get a sense of where things are and if I can, if I can help with anything else.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And in the meantime, I'll send over the trial. The second you sign up, any one of you sign up for the trial, one of you sign up, you can invite the others. The instructions are fairly simple, but in case you want literally five minutes with someone on my team or myself to guide you through it, I'm happy to set that up, but I'm happy to send that over to you at the end of the call. The second I see that trial come up, I will extend it through December just so that you've got enough time over thanksgiving and everything to test it out. And we're okay. Extending it because you're not actually using it, it's just the sandbox in there. So we're happy to extend that out for a few weeks just to make sure that doesn't stand in our way.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Okay, perfect. Sounds good.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, thanks, thanks everyone for jumping on. I hope this was helpful and I look forward to working with the team as we explore this further.

Steve Bulger (bulger.s@efulfillmentservice.com):
  Yeah, thank you. Awesome. Thank you.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Thanks talk soon. Bye bye, bye bye.
