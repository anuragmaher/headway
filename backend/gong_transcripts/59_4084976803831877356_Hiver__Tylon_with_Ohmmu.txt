Call: Hiver & Tylon with Ohmmu
Date: 2025-11-13T01:31:47+05:30
================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, titan, can you hear me?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Yeah. How's it going?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All good. How's it going for you? Good stuff. All right. Hey, I'm going to be video off. I hope that's okay. Just a little bit of the recovery.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Perfect.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Sweet. So, yeah, Tylon, quick introductions, I'm Raghav, I work with the account management team here at hiver. I've been with the business for about eight years working my way through pretty much all GTM roles here at hiver, and happy to chat with you about our exciting new AI feature set. Yeah, I noticed that you wanted to hear about pretty much the entire suite as it stands now in terms of sentiments tagging co pilot. So, could you maybe kick us off with what AI looks like within the organization as of today? Outside of hiver, do you use that for any facet of your work?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Yeah, we're introducing other AI features when it comes to marketing and ads, and just working more with other companies, other platforms to introduce that into our sales leads and marketing and all that kind of stuff. But customer service is a priority of ours just because we have an extensive knowledge base, but it's requiring a lot of like time per customer and we're a small three person team with our company, but we get anywhere from like three to 400 like tickets per month, which is just, it's a lot to manage.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Wait, did you say three to 400 tickets a month for like a two to three member team?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That is crazy.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Yeah. And that's like CEO, like I'm the marketing director, and then his wife is the one who kind of manages we're like a car battery company for like evs and kind… of getting into like the RV and like overland community as well. But because it is a technical product that, you know, can be kind of finicky, you know, right now we have like something like 150 templates like email templates that we use in hiver. So I feel like that is like we've been doing a lot of the groundwork and it feels like it would be, you know, an adequate knowledge base for, you know, integrating… the AI features. It's funny because we were actually looking into like other AI platforms. And then when you guys kind of announced it and had the trial going, we just, you know, we were looking at Ada and Fenn and… but we've been with hiver a while… you know, kind of, I know we want to start with hiver at least, but like some of my other questions were just like in the future, like are we able to like integrate the hiver AI into like Shopify? You know, to take over as like a chat bot? Like, you know, just general questions like that. Like what kind of integration is it going to have like another, you know, sales platform?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that makes sense. I mean from the hiver AI perspective, right there's, a couple of directions in which we're focusing with it on at this stage. The way we're looking at it is current state. We don't have any Shopify integrations or just external tool integration or tech stack integration within the AI. But definitely, that is a direction we're heading in and that's you know, one of the things that's high up on our list of priorities when it comes to AI. Yeah. So, you know, if you'd like to maybe take a peek at what's available today in case you haven't and you'd like to see what that's like. We can definitely run through that. And now you can have any questions if you have just like drop that and we can keep that collaborative. On the other hand, what I can also do is maybe kick us off with a quick little kind of presentation that we have that talks about the entire AI vision for hiver. Yeah. Then, you know, you can tell me which of that makes sense. And I can pretty much validate it against what's available on hiver today, and we can look at it from that angle.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  I will say we're probably going to integrate like every AI feature that you have accessed right now just because, you know, I did, I watched a couple of the presentations already with AI tagging and copilot and agents and all that. So, I had a pretty good understanding of like all those features and so, but putting into practice is kind of like the, it's like the other side of the story.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  So that's yeah, I was kind of eager to see like, you know, the, you know, to meet with someone just to kind of get a, you know, a demo, so to speak.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that, that's even better. I mean, if you've had a chance and you're, you know, aware of what they are and how they do. If you can share your screen, maybe run me through a few examples, I can tell you how, and where, yeah.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  I'll do that. I would still like to, you know, like all the features that we can access right now, like just kind of a, just a general overview because, the, what is it called? The presentation I saw, with? I can't remember who it was with. Let me just double check. It was like September thirtieth, there was a presentation. Oh, we did.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  A webinar with Eric, I think might have been the speaker, yes?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  I think so. It was, the AI advantage, smart customer service with hydrocession, That?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Was Eric, yeah, it's part of our, I mean, he's part of our success team.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Cool. The only issue with that, it was, the audio was like really bad and, you know, there'd be like a lot of skipping. And so, just, sorry, I thought I'd share my screen. You're good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's fine.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Oh, I guess I need permissions that I have to quit and reopen zoom to do that. Oh, first.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Time you're screen sharing?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  No, that's what's weird about it?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Well, okay. I mean, I've got some extra time. I can stick around for like 10 extra minutes over scheduled time. Okay. You're good.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  So I'll just rejoin this meeting for?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. Yes, the same link. I'll be right here. Okay?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Okay. There we go. All right. Yeah, it was this meeting. Where was it? This one? Oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  this is Anurag, and Vignesh. Yeah. All right. So.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  This is the one and it was about the 11 minute mark where they kind of did a really good overview of, you know?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  How?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  It's going to work? Oh, perfect. Yeah. So, if I get a bit of explanation of that, that'd be great. The problem is just, their voices kept cutting in and out. So, it was just, I wasn't getting a very good clear picture of those features. Good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Feedback. I'll just make a quick note of this. Yeah, I think.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Even people were saying like, the audio was like, you know, like switch to low definition, you know, the audio is, you know, not sound is gone, you know, just, yeah, poor quality audio, I guess. So. Okay. So let me see here. So in our hyper, so this is kind of what we're saying, we have the stuff enabled. So I did, the agents, I configured that, and I haven't played with any of the tags. I added one like called salesly, just to kind of, I was kind of using like your guys' prompts, you know, what AI tagging looks like? Yeah, just kind of explaining all these features. And like I imagine from the presentation that I saw that they will all be really helpful. Maybe, the sentiment analysis probably, is probably mostly going to be negative for us anyways, just because people, are having technical issues in the battery. So they're not happy with that. So, I have it enabled just because, you know, and I could kind of see that, we can kind of see that taking into effect right here, you know, with the neutral, and… you know, the positive negative neutral. So I thought it was kind of interesting. But going back to this, I had this synced earlier, and actually using all, does this use our published and unpublished articles?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, yeah, this is if you do have articles on the knowledge base and you enable, it pretty much fetches all of those.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Cool. Okay. Even if they're unpublished.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Do you have an internal or an external knowledge base?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  I'm not sure. This is knowledge base. Yeah. Oh, what's the difference?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, so the difference is external knowledge base, articles are usually stuff that you publish on a website, a landing page, stuff like that, you open it up to others, you can have an internal knowledge base that you can basically this, right? So it's external. On the other hand, you know, some teams just want to have an internal set of documents, sops, sows that they want to use more for internal operations that's the internal link.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah, this is external, yeah, cause it's a completely different URL support, ohmmu, com. Perfect.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, yeah. So, within the knowledge base sync, at this point, it will primarily be for.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  What?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For the published articles?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Got it. Cool. Yeah, sounds good to know.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. And so, yeah, so, I mean, once the sync runs through, it's gonna probably take like five, 10 minutes because of the first time, but effectively, what's going to happen is you're going to have a version of this inside of every email you open… you're going to have that you're going to have a little spark like in bottom right of your screen, and that effectively becomes your copilot interactive space or ask AI interactive space?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  It's like any.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Mailbox, any email, depending on which one you've called it for, and that's.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  when I, and that's when I click into an email.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. When you open the email, there you go. So right now, the way we've got it built out is it can do two things. One is it can obviously summarize the conversation. And if the knowledge base has the right set of information, it will be able to give you a very clear next steps based on your process as well. So, it's not just 10 bullet points of what's happened on the thread so far, but actually takes it a step forward tells you summary the issues that were highlighted, the steps your team took. And then if you keep scrolling down, you're going to see that it's actually pretty more built out than the generic, you know, sort of summarizing you get with gemini or something like that, right? Got it. And your step two of this is you obviously, you can draft a reply with it. You can converse with it to an extent of a conversational AI model that kind of like chat gpt kind of like gemini again, just that the difference is that these kind of conversations you have with it is going to be more along the lines of the emails, the context and the process and the documents that you've added, right? So I don't want you to just like, you know, have the impression that it's more conversational on a general AI perspective. It's just that it's going to be a little more refined and a lot more contextual driven by the data you've added. Now, the next iteration of this that you're the copilot in itself is right now if you click on the copilot again… what it can do, or you've got to do that hybrid logo, top right? And get the tree out or the other one? Sorry, which.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  One.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  This one here? Oh, okay. Yeah, I didn't.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  know, I minimized, that toggles it. Okay. I see.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. So this is one of the things now if you go down and you'll be like draft a reply, you know, xyz, whatever you wanted to do, it can basically draft that reply message ready to go. And in that reply message, it's going to use your knowledge base again.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  So if I, so I need to respond to this through text or do I hit the like button?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, the like is more for like feedback of the quality. Oh, I see. Yeah, you can like converse with it of sorts and you can keep refining it.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Got it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Excuse me on the reply itself that it generates… so, yeah, so straightforward route of doing it that's pretty much the ask AI in a quick neat little nutshell, right? So you can skim through that, see what it's like. And when you're ready, insert, the whole thing becomes a draft that's ready to send out. As soon as you do that. Right now, you're going to notice that the text at the top and bottom aren't removed. And we've already pushed an update for that. We're just waiting on Google Chrome to release that update. Basically. So if you notice that text, right?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Yeah. So we just delete that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, for the time being, can probably just delete that what my engineering team told me.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It's both at the top and the bottom. But yeah, as per my engineering team, we're about one week away from Google Chrome releasing or launching the updated version. So once that's out, you don't need to do that. It becomes a draft that you can just send it one click.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Got it. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, yeah. So that's ask AI. Now, if you want to be a little more conversational with ask AI, if you click on the three dots over here within that console, right? And do clear chat, it's actually going to give you a clean slate to start from. Okay, right? So you can pretty much go at it from scratch or ask it a different set of questions or have it refine the answer based on a knowledge source. All of that stuff. Right now, the immediate enhancement that we've got on the cards for ask AI is so far you've had to go to like the admin panel, the place we were at and either add it as a knowledge base or sync the information from there. And what we're going to be launching is a way for you to basically drag and drop information. So you're on ask AI, you're typing something, you have an attachment, drag and drop the attachment in that window on the right side. And it pretty much includes that as the source and gives you a better response based on that… right? So that's ask AI as a whole as it stands right now, in terms of enhancements, we're launching a notion integration with ask AI. So if you use that for knowledge that's going to come in. And yeah, as it stands, that's the ask AI for right now, in terms of what you have access to readily today, right now, the other two pieces are AI tagging and AI sentiments. In terms of AI sentiments. For like a standard support team, what people usually do is they tie it back to automations? Is that something you can do, right? So if you want, you can kick off a workflow based on a negative sentiment or a very negative sentiment. You know, if you're doing like a five point scale for instance, and somebody comes in as like really negative or like really pissed off, basically… you can tweak that and be like, if somebody is coming in with a really negative sentiment, just do a bunch of bells notify somebody classified a certain way, add a tag, whatever fits your fancy, right? Yeah. On the other hand, just because of the nature of the business you're in, you can also be like if somebody gives you a very positive sentiment on the email, then you can again, what a lot of customers like you with hiver do is they send out a review link, drop us a review on Shopify, talk about our experience, right? That becomes a quick little closing the loop kind of perspective. Yeah. So, yeah. So that's the sentiment piece that flows into reporting as well. And the last one is the tagging piece, and that's more for like probabilistic categorization. So if you do a configure, you start by again as the organization using hiver, you have full control. So you start by either selecting existing tags or just creating stuff from scratch right there. Now, what you'll need to do is train that AI model for the tagging aspect, give it 10 examples where you manually add that tag on emails. After the tenth email. It's going to automatically start applying that to matching conversations.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Yeah. So, yeah. So, okay. So use each tag on at least 10 conversations to train hiver AI. So what I would do then is I'd go to the email and let's just say this was a tag. I don't think this one is tagged yet. This one is not tagged yet, right? Yeah, at least I can't because this is what a tag would look like up here exactly?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yep.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  So here I would add. How do I add a tag to this?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  This one? Sure.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Okay. So these must be pulling, let… me see.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So these are part of what you've created as tags as a team. And if you notice that part that I've highlighted on the left side is where you manage them.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  I see. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, you want to create some, you go ahead from here. You hover over the rows on the left side and that lets you delete them. Basically, that's your categorization mechanism.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  I'm just going to make one up real quick.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  sure. Yeah. So our CEO is like our head engineer.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So let's.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  do something.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Okay, great. So, if I want to go back, I'm going to go back here back to that same one. Add the tag.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  But my question then is… I don't want AI to get the wrong idea because it's like very, it's almost like we're tagging that based on neither me or his wife can answer the technical aspect of that question. And so we want to tag it. I don't know maybe that's not the way we should use it. Is that right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. The way I'd suggest or recommend using the tags, Is more from a perspective of probabilistic categorization less to do with the internal outcome you're expecting?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Right. I see.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, instead of putting it as Sean responds, what I'd probably classify it as instead is technical question or something along those lines, right? Where, you know, it's easier for the AI to sort of pick up on a pattern when you feed it those 10 examples and tie it back to the title or the name of it. And then internally between the three of, you can decide, hey, this, I mean, if it's this tag, then Sean's got to take on a show.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  You know, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm just gonna, yeah, that was a good idea. So, technical question apply. And then will I see that tag on the outside or do I have to refresh it real quick?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It would, once you add the tag, it should be just like that sales leader will show up there.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Okay. It's not tagging yet, but I imagine because it's still right here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, it's right there. Now, if you go back, I think you should see it. Okay?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  I'm sure it will generate at some point.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, it's just maybe a hard refresh. But, yeah. So the one thing you do have to note is you've got to go to. So the usual way of doing this is create the tag, go to this module here.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  From this, okay?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Include it, give it examples and then go at it from there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So if you see that one email you just added in. So if you click on that.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  And when it says it needs, so, technically, what I need to do is for, I need to tag 10 emails with the technical question tag, 10 emails with the billing tag, correct? That's how you train it exactly. Yeah, that's manageable. I can do that. Cool. So, the aspect of the AI agent that was the most intriguing was the autoresponder where it took all of our team out of it. How do I know if that's happening? How do I know if AI responded independently without us?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Great question. That is a feature that we've got slated for launch mid December if not a little before that. So, AI responses or AI suggested responses as we're calling, it is basically an evolution of copilot that I showed you right now, go there, draft a reply. So that's more like the next step or stage of that in itself. And the way we're putting it out, obviously, we want you as, you know, just like the question you asked, we want everybody to know hey AI is doing this. So it's probably not going to automatically send out the reply for the first couple of weeks after launch, at the very least, right? Got it. It's going to generally.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  This is where I saw it. It was right here. It says, I want to respond to fax, close, thank you replies exactly. Yeah. So we were interested in that, and I realized, you know, we're actually not comfortable with that right away exactly. So we just want to, if it does happen, we just wanted to be aware of it and how to audit that on our side. So, okay, let's get to know right now. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, what we've got on the roadmap for now is AI QA or quality control, quality analysis that we're launching that's. Going to be out before next Friday, and that will be the administrative check that you're looking for.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Right? So,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  that's going to come first followed by the AI answers or AI suggested responses in terms of the name of that feature, right? Okay. That little slide deck that you showed me from the webinar that's the entire vision for like the next three months to six months period in terms of the full landscape of all the building things.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  What was the other feature that you said? Wasn't quite active yet? I'm trying to remember, I was literally at the beginning of the call you were saying, I can't remember what feature that was. You said it wasn't operational yet, but that it was going to be.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that was going to be the integration of knowledge base with notion and the ability to drag and drop documents within copilot or ask AI when you're chatting with it, right? So, it's going to be notion as a knowledge base integrating to ask AI.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, we've got and that's an,

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  upcoming feature?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's an upcoming feature slated before the end of this month.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah… aiqa, before the end of this month as well.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  What's aiqa?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So think about it as that check you wanted when it comes to auto generated responses or AI. Oh.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Got it. Okay. What.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  you'll effectively have is a control panel within the admin space that will let you feed to the AI system, the kind of stuff you'd want every reply to have. And then you can basically track it for correctness, see if it's being followed and run reporting on it at the end of the day to see the competency level of all the emails that go out, quality competency, the level of detail, all of that stuff.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Cool. Then the other question I had is, so if I have knowledge base syncing here, is there any communication between our external knowledge base and our email templates that we have 100 plus? So like here is our email templates that we use for customers when they ask stuff, will hiver, AI be able to pull from this as well and suggest templates based on this knowledge here?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So that's a great question. As of right now, we're actually working on a feature that would incorporate this in the answer. So instead of using it directly or suggesting the templates, it's going to be directly used in the response itself in terms of cycles, that's going to be a two phase release. So, the first phase of that would be AI giving you template suggestions slated for the end of December or early qanon as it stands right now, a lot of our AI roadmap especially with these smaller things tends to be accelerated if we have a lot of people asking for it as well. Tentatively, we're looking at it in qanon next year might be done earlier if we've got enough people requesting it as well. But yeah, definitely a direction we're thinking in for.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Sure. Yeah, because this is a massive portion of how we manage our customer service tickets, right? So to not be able to utilize this right now is I'm trying to think of a workaround. So if I moved all these templates to our external knowledge base and it could pull it from there, but then those would have to be published, but we don't want those email templates published publicly. I.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Can give you a recommendation. So if you notice there's something called snippets, right? And those snippets are basically just copy based text you want to throw in. So if you do want to get your templates, part of the knowledge base… might be a little cumbersome, but I just say copy the whole content, add it as a snippet and that should get you going.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  So, we did something like this where I just copied that, that's fine. So the,

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  I don't want that.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  It's probably not going to work as seamless as we think, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Now, yeah, it's definitely not going to be as seamless as the templates, but it will definitely use a lot of these elements in the response so far when we've tested it, it's got like a seven to eight percent accuracy in terms of getting the right one.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Got it, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Just without the templates itself. So, I'm sure it's just going to be better with the templates active.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Okay. Yeah, cool.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. And.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  The last thing actually Tylon, there is one more feature that I want to tell you about the AI front. Can you go to one of your inboxes and pop open an automation? I'm sorry, within the admin panel, sorry.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Oh, so I click on the email?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, can you go to your hyperadmin panel up here? And then admin panel. Yeah, that's the same tab you had open. So go to shared inboxes and click through like click inside any of those. Yeah. The regular support or contact, yeah, go to automations, and then just click on, create new or create automation. Yeah. So the reason I brought you here is we've got a very smaller piece of AI here called AI extract now because the nature of a lot of your emails deals with other ids and other numbers and stuff like that. If that's something you want to extract and show up on hiver, right side, just openly visible, easily accessible. You can extract those numbers using AI and just have it displayed there on the right side if that's useful.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Yeah. No, that would be. So if I did, so, we receive a new conversation?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Or would it be?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, it'll be new conversation as we see as a standard add, step, yeah, extract the second option. Yeah, and then say extract it from body and subject. Yeah. And then once you're done just like click through anywhere, type out the information. It's looking for, just the term, yeah, and then click on train. So now you've got to give it like valid order numbers mostly like a copy paste, Yeah. Let's do that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Just the audio.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Just the number. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, this third tab… oh, it's the third tab. Yeah, that one, the one to the, no, no, no.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  The zoom… thing was in my way. Oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  sorry. No worries. Yeah. Now, paste it on the right side. Yes, two more of those. Oh, that's pretty easy.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Six and five and search. It's going to, oh, can you click on the back next to search results and use the hashtag? Yeah, just insert the hashtag. Oh, okay. Yeah, search. Oh, can you do it back again and add the brackets as well? I'm just trying to see how accurate of a match it needs to be.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Oh, it does need. Yeah, it needs the brackets. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Sorry, if you can hear that. I'm with my mother is in a care facility right now. We have alarms going off. So, oh,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  no, you're good. You're good. All right. Interesting. Okay. Quick check. Can you go to that email? I just want to see if it's on the same inbox. We're doing this. Yeah. The actual, this one's inside your contact. Can you go back to the AI, extract the automation piece that we had? Excuse me. Can we just back out of here real quick? Yeah, like fully back? Yeah, relief. Oh, we're in support. That's why I didn't fetch which one the inbox. So, this inbox is support and that email was in contact?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Oh, yeah. Got it. Okay. How do I switch your contact? There we go.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Automation.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  automation. Great. Yeah, that's it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  AI extract.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Order id, we type out the name.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Train. And then we do the holding again, the same with the brackets. Yep.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Shit. There we go. So, now we just select the three, match it to the correct one. So, it knows exactly what these numbers are. I think it's the first one two…, one, two, eight, six, seven.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  And this one's pulling up other stuff. I'm not sure why. Okay. Yeah, the order number is not here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Let's do a different one. Then instead of two, one, two, eight, six, yeah, four, maybe… there we go. There we go the first one next… and then, yeah, give it a bit. There. We go close… and then click on add step and do the action. Yeah, drop down, scroll down… and you can, there we go add it as a note… right? And then just click on variable, that button that says variable. Yeah, and then say, pin this note. Just check that box as well, save and enable and that's about it. So now, every time there's an order number on the subject of the body, this one's going to get that added as a note. And that's going to be straightforward. Now, if you click on custom fields for me, real quick… add a custom field… text… okay, name this order number?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Save field. Okay. We go back to that automation. I just want to double check if we've got this where you can add it to the custom field. So three dots on the right side and edit. Okay, scroll down again to the action piece, and then say, add a step again… action, just select action, scroll down. There we go. So order number, click on that and then click on variable. Yeah. So you can scroll up and delete the one that says, add a note, just hover over it on the right side. Yeah. So the reason I brought you to do this instead of the notice, this one's going to be right under the tag. So it's more above easier to spot as opposed to having to scroll down… right? So if you save this and we go back to the support inbox, you can see where this will show up.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Can we go back to Gmail real quick?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hello?

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Go back to what?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. Sorry, just had a bit of a.

Tylon Blas (tylon@ohmmu.com):
  Did you say?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, I just got you back. I lost you for like a good 15 seconds back there, but, yeah, let's open one. Okay. Excuse me. Let's open an email from the same mailbox. I think we did it in contact. So you pick one from contact. Yeah, pop something open. Just any email is fine. And there you go. So, do you see order number there on the right side, right at the top… right? So going forward, any new email you receive it'll, have the order number fetched and populated. It doesn't do a historical backfill. But going forward from this point onwards, that field will get filled if the order number is there. Got it. Cool. Yeah, the purpose of that is just to help me. It's just an additional summarization of what the conversation is about. Yeah, at this point, that's effectively what we have rather we are looking at including that in future builds just to give you that full AI experience as it stands today. It's just surfacing the most… Cool. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'll try to find other ways to use that. Well, let me do one thing here. So, yeah, Tylon, so, what was the last thing you said? We were cutting out again? Oh, sorry. My bad. Is it better now? Yeah. All right. No, I was just saying I'll follow up the call with that, the slide deck that I'd mentioned. So you have that for reference? You know, how we're doing it and we'll move on towards. And what I'll also do is have you added as a person of interest for the AI, QA and AI suggested responses. So you get updates the moment they're launched, you can check it out and we can look at commercials on that point down the line. Bye. Awesome. Yeah, that's a good place for us to get started. I think I, yeah, it's just going to be, you know, doing the steps to start training and seeing how it can best suit us. And if I had questions about like, you know, how to use the AI features, like what would be… like my next step to asking questions. Oh, you can just write me an email and if I'm around, I'll definitely have the details found out gathered and sent over. If not, I'll just loop in my support team and they should be able to like give you more specifics on that front.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. And then, so this is your email right here? Yeah. Looks like I don't have your personal email. Let me just send that over to you. I've just put it on zoom chat.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay, perfect. Okay. All right, brilliant. Tylon. Hey, anything else for today?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that's it. Thank you so much. All right. Pleasure. Chatting. Look forward to more questions as you start using AI, hope you have a great day, Tylon. Awesome. Thank, you too. Bye bye bye.
