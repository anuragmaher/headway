================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Helen. Can you hear me?

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yes. Hi. How are you? Doing fine. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. We've got Jesse and Donna as well. Hey, folks. How's everybody doing this Friday? Good? How are you? All good, just dealing with a bit of the flu. So I'm going to keep video off if that's okay with everybody, but otherwise, good to go for today's. Call.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Awesome. Hope you feel better soon.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Thank you so much. Well, pleasure meeting everybody again folks. It's been a while since we spoke last time and looks like you're all interested in the AI features on hiver. Yeah. So, yeah. So before we, yeah, sorry, go ahead.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yes, we spoke about AI last time too.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Yes. Yeah, Jesse. Yeah, because I saw on the meeting that the co pilot was like the primary piece of interest. So I wanted to like pass it back to the team initially to kick things off, understand what the reactions are like and effectively go from there in terms of working ahead?

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Was that thing co pilot? Let me see. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. The co pilot ask AI?

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Co pilot, okay? From the one that we from knowledgebase, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. The one that shows up on the right panel, you can type out, get a response, the assistant piece?

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yeah, I see it. Yes, I did not know that piece was additional cost. So I want to learn a bit more about that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, brilliant. Okay. So, I mean, before I kick off with like a boilerplate demo on how that works and walk you through that. Has anybody in the room had a chance to check it out so far?

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  No, go ahead.

Donna Cura (donna@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yeah. All of us are using it right now.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And what's the reactions like?

Donna Cura (donna@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yeah, it's been great. It's getting all the information from our knowledgebase. I actually have one concern though, I check it from time to time and I noticed that the settings changes from time to time. I don't know if that's… an error on your end. But if I check on leasing on our inbox, leasing department, general inquiries, it does change the setting. Just like yesterday, I'm pretty sure that I turned on or I enable it, the copilot because I've been using it for a couple of days. And then yesterday, I was trying it out. I was trying to make a training video but then I noticed that it doesn't pull up the information. Then I checked the setting and, it wasn't it was disabled for some reason. So I don't know why.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. That's weird. I mean, on that front, one thing is we have been making a few updates in terms of the whole AI layout and things. We recently revamped our entire automations as well. So it's no longer like it was before it's more free flowing. It's more block oriented as well. I'm assuming that one of those changes might have maybe disabled the AI, but going forward, none of that would happen. We've got like the foundation in the right place and none of your settings in effect for the AI as a whole would be changed or modified going forward. Yeah.

Donna Cura (donna@theearnesthomes.com):
  Okay. Perfect. If anything happens again, I'll let you know.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Definitely. All right. So, I mean, considering that you've had some time to use, the ask AI or the copilot in itself team, what would you like to do for today's? Call, would you want to discuss commercials? Would you want to learn about the other AI features that you might not have checked out? Or would you want to just dive deep into copilot and get like a five minute overview in terms of its full capabilities?

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Okay. Well, first of all, I would like to know pricing.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. And.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Second of all, I would like to check if our faqs that we created is working as is intended because I think Helen you can do a screen share for him, how you create your faq to see if AI is going to read that?

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Okay. Just a moment.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And I'm sorry if I'm not fully tracking conversations over the last two weeks, I've been on pto for like four days out sick. And additionally, I wanted to give you a heads up that Garima has decided to part ways with hiver, which means I'm going to be kind of your primary point of contact for the time being. And I'll introduce the new success manager as soon as we have the new person allocated for your account as well. Yeah.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Awesome. Okay. No problem.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Oh, here we go share… you know.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Okay. So what we did is we added our frequently asked questions… to KB. Okay. I left our link if we're going to go and check something that we might have changed, but here is all the questions that are on our website regarding owners.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  And I understand that the AI would read this, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm sorry, the AI will read this, yes, yes, yes.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Okay. But it won't go to any links, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, the AI would be able to read the entire knowledge base that's on hiver and it would be able to extract information from that on the URL perspective. I don't think it's going to be able to like go further into the URL inside from here. Yeah. So just for my curiosity, outside of all of the detailed information you put on the knowledge base here, does the link have any additional data that's probably not on the article?

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yeah. In this particular case, it's the pricing. Okay. We wanted it to check on the pricing, and I believe that in the tenant questions, let me check.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  It would be the online application and rental criteria. But other than that, no.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. All right.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Maybe what we do for our vendors and utility connect, but no.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's it… understood. No, that makes total sense. So, from what I'm seeing and from the way we've got the co pilot built out or the ascii built out, it should be able to extract all of this information that's on your knowledge base article. And if you'd like we can run a quick check to see if it's able to get the pricing based on the link as well.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  All right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Now, I was going to say if we can run a quick check on your end, can you just open any email on hiver? Just real quick, right? Like within the inbox where you've got co pilot enabled?

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  First of all, I'm not sure if I have it enabled, but I've been using the.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  All right. So that's co?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Pilot that's the one? Yes. All right. Can you click on that? And Helen, do you have admin access on hiver? By any chance? I do? All right. Perfect. Okay. Can you just like type out there an information that you think will be available on the pricing link? Not on the document? Like, can you ask it a question? Hey, can you give me pricing for the tenant or something like that? You know, something that's on the link within the article, not on the article in itself. Okay?

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Let's try the rental criteria for sure. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Let's scroll up… and, yeah, we'll give the AI a bit to see and what I'd basically like for you to do is just double check the information and see if it's accurate. Is that the right one?

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Donna, could you help me out?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes.

Donna Cura (donna@theearnesthomes.com):
  That is correct.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  And,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  this is information that's not within the article, in itself, right? It's part of a link on the article.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  That is correct.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Looks like it's able to fetch everything including stuff on the article and the links as well. Can you click on the four sources as you scroll all the way to the bottom?

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Sure. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm just double checking if the copilot's performing like it should, there we go, it's got applicant faqs from your website, and then the hiver faq articles as well. Oh.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  I see.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. There we go.

Helen Del Cid (helen@theearnesthomes.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. Perfect. So, it looks like copilot's working the way it should, and it's able to like read through all the data including the stuff on hyperlinks as well. Jessie, you said you wanted to check on a general sense about the knowledge base. Were there any specific questions that you wanted to like check or were there any outstanding issues that you wanted to like talk about?

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  No, I don't use them as much, this one, my team using them because obviously, I'm the one creating all this knowledge base. So I never really use them. Got it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  right. I just want to make sure that the format that we put in is reading correctly?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, Donna.

Donna Cura (donna@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yeah, I have a question for, I noticed that the copilot only applies for if you're going to reply to a certain email, but if you're going to use it like the first time, you know, compose an email, it doesn't show up.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Show me an example. If you don't mind?

Donna Cura (donna@theearnesthomes.com):
  I mean, if I'm going to compose an email… sure. Let me share my screen.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. So for compose, the copilot isn't meant for composing an email, could you give me like an example of what you'd like to do with the copilot when it comes to composing?

Donna Cura (donna@theearnesthomes.com):
  Well, let's say, for example, I want to like get all the information from our knowledge base, create a draft from there. So I don't know if you, if that makes sense?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I mean, quite honestly, it's the first time, you know, people have asked for like something on compose directly that's not just like, you know, a summarizer or like a better way of grammar and formatting. How frequently do you see this happening where you'd want to like get the information and start a new thread instead of dropping a reply to an existing question?

Donna Cura (donna@theearnesthomes.com):
  So let's say, okay, I want to like compose an email for… what you call it. I want to let them know that this property is available. And here are the rental criteria. Here are the links that they can use and it's available on our KB. Can I use it or can a copilot start from creating an email or it doesn't.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  no, it doesn't so the copilot is primarily more for writing assistant when it comes to replies as a whole for existing questions and conversations that you receive, it's, not necessarily meant for like new conversations. At least as it stands right now, in the way we're looking at it, what I can do is maybe take that as a feature request. And like I said, you know, we don't have a lot of people requesting for a copilot on composing an email. So I'll have to check with the team and circle back if that's something that we will be picking up in that sense of things as a suggestion. What I can recommend is maybe having the KB article filled out as an email template, you know, a standard email template, and then just use the KB article link. Now that you've got it on the KB on hiver, right? So that way when you're sending it out, you can have the properties or the location based templates just with the relevant KB article links. And that should just make it easier for you to search the template, use it and initiate the conversation. When you do get a reply from an applicant based on that, the copilot can pretty much kick in and help, you know, refine that answer, keep the conversation going with less effort.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Understood for sure. For sure. Donna. All right. I mean if those are all the questions, then Jesse, to your point about the commercials in itself, the entire AI add on suite on hiver including the copilot, the AI tagging, AI sentiment analysis, the small little emojis you see, and we've got AI QA that's going to launch on the… AI insights is going to be coming pretty soon as well before the end of this quarter. And we're also going to have AI tasks. So all of these and any other AI features we'll be launching are all bundled into a single add on. It's going to be in addition to your entire subscription and it's at usd per person per month as a whole, cool.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yep. That's a lot because we don't use all that we only need. The sentiment is not good for our type of business. Like it's seven percent negative because it's like work order. They complain about work orders like nothing to do with us. You know, the only thing we're using for is the AI assist that's all we're using the rest. We're not using anything.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. But I mean, the way we've got the whole AI suite structured is, you know, unlike the other businesses or tools out there, we didn't want to do like a piecemeal approach. We don't want to break it up and it's not charged based on usage so, for instance, you can have as many responses generated across the board and everything. And so considering all of that, we've kept it as a single package. What I can do, Jesse, again given our relationship over the past few years, especially, you know, over the last year or so since you joined hiver and how closely we've worked together, I can check if there's like a small discount. I can work in, right? See if there's any incremental or marginal discount I can add to the price to make it a little easier. Yeah.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yeah, because I think you're essentially charging double for one feature.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, I mean, as it stands, it's one feature, but I'm sure like once QA is out, once insights are out, all of those things will definitely add to the total. And that's effectively why we've kept it consciously at 20, not higher or not lower.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Those are not tested. So I don't know if I want to pay before it even came out. Nah, there's even better.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Mode, I get it. Jesse. But even then, all said and done at the end of the day, you know, it's still like about a 10 dollar lesser than a typical chat gpt or a gemini in itself. So, yeah, Jesse, I mean, I understand where you're coming from in terms of the price at 20 in itself being a little too steep compared to your existing subscription cost as well. If you're you know, if the pricing makes sense, what I can do is I can work with obviously like a time based discount and see if I can get the pricing dropped a bit more. Would you be open to sort of confirming in the next two weeks? If that makes sense? I can work with that. Okay? Yeah.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Send me your pricing.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Definitely. So I'll be tying it to a November 20 first deadline for confirmation and, you know, moving on or enabling the add on.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And based on that, I'll have a discussion with my leadership team to see what I can unlock and, you know, that way I can send you options and you can let me know if that makes sense and we can continue from there.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Okay. You got it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. Anything else you would want to do? All right. Cool. Well, hey, folks. Thanks so much for hopping on sharing the feedback. I'll be sure to like check if there's anything additional that might be useful for your team. And before I let you all go, I did want to see if you had the chance to check out the new automations on hiver.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  New automation. No, I have not been able to check that out yet. I don't know what it does.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Let me just give you folks a quick two minute rundown of what that does and, you know, especially considering the space here and I feel like there's one AI feature within the automation that could be useful, right? I just want to let you know what that's like and you can explore it. So with the new automations on hiver, what we've done is effectively revamped, the way the whole thing works. Now, you get like things like you get a whole automation summary as you start creating it's, more of a free flowing creator. And that has given us the option to sort of additionally include other elements sentiment. For instance, I know it's not necessarily relative to you but if you'd want to do something with it that's a supportive trigger in a general sense of the automation. Though what you do have is an AI extract piece very specifically here. And this would effectively let you extract elements like in your case, things like rental id or applicant id or anything on that front by giving it like three examples, training it again, just with three and it should be good to go. But effectively, what you'll do is you'll be able to use this extracted id, alphanumeric pure numbers, whatever be the case and use that to update a custom field to then kick off an automation for example, or have that information flow into hiver. So that whenever you open an email, it's data that you see on the right panel, just like that, like for example, one of the things we've got is a ticket summary and that would effectively tell the team. Hey, this is a summary of the conversation so far, just a quick write up, right? So these.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  are on Gmail. There's summary on Gmail already?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. There's like I'm sure like Jesse to be fully transparent with you. You're gonna see a lot of similarities, not just Gmail and hiver, whatever tools you use as well. It's gonna be a lot of similarities on the AI front. The way we've looking at the whole AI chapter over here at hiver, is we wanna make it more contextual. Gmail has the summarizer, but as far as we've tested it, I've got a couple of screenshots I can send you after the call as well, where this is as overall as it gets. It's great when you just wanna get a general sense of things. On the other hand, the hiver way of building it out especially with the AI is with your knowledge pieces and everything fully built out. Now, the summarizer we've got is not just gonna tell you, hey here's what happened so far? But it's actually gonna give you actions taken on the threat. So far. What the actual issue was. It's gonna give you isolated information on the current status and next steps depending on your process. So that's how we're reworking the AI to make sure that there's a differentiation from what you typically get with gemini versus where hiver stands out in the AI development cycle, right?

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yeah. So I just noticed one thing.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, please, from.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Hiver, you guys are using British English, not American English. Am I right? Because I saw earlier, you said summarized with the S, not with the Z.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, no, I think summarizes S, on both British and American English. I don't think we have a preference to be very transparent with you.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Because earlier when I saw it said summarizing, right? We said summarize… oh, yeah, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I see what you mean. I see what you mean.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  So, I don't know when you generate a response on, yeah, right there. So I don't know when you generate a response on hyper. Are you using American English or are you using British English or is there an option to like select.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Again, quite honestly, nobody's asked me that question so far. So I give you kudos on the it detail. Is there a certain preference because, you know, it's all built on an AI model as such, and it's pretty adaptive. So, if you'd like what I can do is just do a quick test. For example. Is there a preference for you? Like would you prefer the American English or British English in specific?

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  I mean, we obviously prefer American because it's the most used.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let me just as straightforward as it gets, right? Let me just type something in and, yeah, oh, wait sorry.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No. The whole AI model though from what we've checked and tested with our customers is that it does full multilingual capabilities. So it's going to be able to like give you any language that you want. And if you have like a certain preference, it's going to be able to like give you that information in the selected dialect that you want as well. Although again, let me just check with the team to see if there's a default preference on the language in itself or like the type of language in itself. Yeah?

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Yes, yes. All right. Let me.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely do that. And I'll have that over to you as well. But, yeah, folks, that was the one other smaller element of AI based outcomes that I think or rather wanted to highlight for the team for today. Well, that said again, everybody, thank you so much for your time on the call. Jesse. Let me follow up with you in terms of commercials, we can work out what that looks like and pretty much take it from there in terms of next steps and getting it enabled for your account.

Jesse Sasomsup (jesse@theearnesthomes.com):
  Awesome. Thank you so much.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. Thank you everybody for hopping on. Have a good day. Bye bye.
