================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, Richard. Hello, you? Alright. Hi, how are you doing, sir?

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Yeah, not too bad, sir.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good. Thank you for joining. I guess we have got a couple of more folks invited to the meeting. So I'll wait until they join in.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Yeah, hopefully. Alright. I'll try and make sure they're joining if you bear with me two minutes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. Take your time in the meanwhile. Notice that you are head of it services at the college. And yeah, we would love to understand a bit more about what prompted you on hiver before that. I'll definitely introduce myself. Look at how we've been helping a lot of other colleges and universities across the globe. So let's wait until everybody join in and then we'll kick start that off.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Yeah, fantastic. As I said, I'm really hoping the head of marketing joins because it was him that initially… wanted to investigate this product. So he'll be joining. I'll just message him now and see. Okay?

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Okay. Hopefully they are on route… just bear with them a couple of minutes if they're getting.

Philip Laskowski (philip.laskowski@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Hello… I can't hear anybody.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hey, Philip. Thank you for joining in.

Philip Laskowski (philip.laskowski@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Oh, I can hear people. Hello.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Alright. I think we're waiting for a couple of more folks to join in. Yeah, we've got Richard here from the it.

Philip Laskowski (philip.laskowski@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  I'm the other person from it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Alright. Great. Nice to meet you.

Philip Laskowski (philip.laskowski@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Hello?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Alright. I think we'll wait for Dan.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Okay. Yeah, Dan's, not going to be able to make it, but Jaeson's on route. My mistake. I spelt his name incorrectly in the invite. So I've forwarded him the invite now, so it'll be a couple of minutes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. No worries.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Just curious, Richard. You said this request came in from your marketing team?

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Yeah. So Jaeson who is now on route, he came to me Friday and said that he was looking to use hiver. So I'll be totally honest. I'm a little bit in the dark as to what the usage requirement would be so, really keen for him to drive that piece. Obviously, we'll have to facilitate as it and make sure that it's compliant with all our policies which I'm probably certain it will be. But obviously we have to do that due diligence when we sign up for any user. But, yeah. So once he's you know, given his kind of use case, then it'll be a case of understanding what it does and what else it can do, maybe that we haven't thought about if that makes sense?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we'll wait until Jaeson joins in, try and understand his needs, use cases and establish if this is a good platform.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Exactly.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And just so that I'm well prepared for the demonstration. Do you want to tell me if you guys are a Google workspace company or do you use?

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Microsoft? No, we're Microsoft. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. Thank you.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Now say he's in a meeting, but I don't see him in this meeting yet.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. There we see. I see him in the far area. I'll let him in.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Okay, perfect.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Apologies, Jaeson, I spelt your name wrong when I signed you up for the demonstration. So hence why you didn't.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  yeah, no, really.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  So, my apologies.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Jaeson, thank you for joining in. Let me introduce. I've got, I spoke with Richard already. My name is Rakesh and I take care of sales at hiver for the european and the UK territory. I've been with the company for over four years, personally onboarded more than 500 teams onto the platform today. We're going to be talking about your needs in specific, understand if this is a good solution towards the end of the call and obviously give you a quick presentation, the walkthrough of the platform. Does this sound like a good agenda for today?

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Yes, great for me?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Thank you.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  To begin with, can I please understand what made you look at hiver? How did you hear about us?

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Shall I answer rich?

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Yeah, absolutely. I did state that you came to me last week and, you know, we want to look to facilitate, but obviously, you'd be best placed to answer that question.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Yeah. So Rakesh, we have a number of shared inboxes in our business. My own team, our marketing team run one and we basically all look at it. We all answer it. Sometimes when we respond to those inboxes, we copy it back to the inbox, so we know it's been answered but it's not always that clear. I think in our team, I think sometimes we over answer so two of us might answer it at the same time. But in some of the other areas of the business, we've got shared ones. And I'm not sure where their roles are not necessarily about answering an email. They're out teaching students or whatever. I think that there are a few emails that go astray that just don't get covered. So predominantly coming from a bit of a call center background myself. It seems very strange that we don't have a method to understand what comes into our business, report on it and report on how successfully we update and respond… to things and how quickly we do it. And any method to make sure that we do follow up the slightly more complicated things that are not just a quick response. And so across the business, we have a range of these emails, the shared inbox emails. And so I started thinking, well, maybe there's a tool we could use to put on top of this. So I did a bit of research and I found you guys that sort of looked like we were thinking and just suggested it. So it's really it would be him sort of looking at this in terms of whether we can make it work with our technical solutions. But from mine, you know, it's the end of the customer service journey that I look after from a marketing perspective. So I don't own all these things, but it seems like a pretty important one. If we generate queries from our open days or other things, then I want to make, be very confident that we actually follow them up and deliver on them. So I think that's sort of where we are, why we rich approached you guys last week.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Yeah, yeah. And I'll just finish that. There's discussions came to me last week from basically… the senior manager saying that, you know, asking me for what the best way to approach this would be. And Jason's kind of alluded to that there isn't necessarily a best practice way for this because you can have a shared mailbox in one department that's really actively monitored and is fantastic. And then another, as Jason said, you know, it might not be their core function to manage emails. So they don't check very often, but of course, you could have the complacency come in. Then if you've got four people, it's you know, between them, they're supposed to manage the mailbox. So, you know, hopefully one of them has looked in there this week or something but then transpires actually in some cases, people haven't looked at them for a couple of months or something. And yeah, distribution groups don't really work because then they could end up getting multiple responses because there's no way of telling if somebody else has responded to that email. So, yeah, I'd like to see how you, what… you're offering is really around this space?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. I mean you've landed at the right place. I've helped a number of customers and this is not the first time I'm hearing. I mean we are all, every day, almost every conversation is around the current processes of keeping a lot of carbon copies, forwarding emails, manually, double answering the customers at the end of the day, missing conversations because we don't have analytics. We have got no reports. All of those systems are, very traditional way of working on the shared inboxes. And I hear that I get your point here now to be more specific to your question and your use cases, Jaeson. Do you mind telling me what different mailboxes do you have today? Which one is the most concerning for you? How do you currently work out of that inbox today? Any information on those typical inboxes will really help me visualize the current scenario?

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Okay. I can tell you a couple of different ones. The one that's really raised the question here is that following one of our open days in the last few weeks, we had a number of queries into our course… inboxes. So for each of our course types, we do land based things, so agriculture or etc, so that people who are interested in our courses, they can actually talk to the curriculum teams. And so they ask agriculture or ask, and it's sort of clear that the way they've been managed is inconsistent, some really do answer them very well and answer them very quickly and some they've sort of somehow fallen into disuse. And so there's questions going into those following on from an open day where they're just not getting answered. So there's that's… you know, that's the one that's driven this. And there's six or seven of those, I think from memory. Then we have our big shared inboxes, which is the ones to our admissions team. Our courses. Now, they do answer those. And I know that team answer all of them. But what they don't really have any reporting on any of them. They don't really, you know, they have no methodology for closing that query off. Etc. So that's so I know they're answered some like I say are unanswered. And the other one, you know, there are for transport and admissions and accommodation. All those kind of, I think that's what traditionally what we've done is every time we've got a place where someone might ask us a number of similar questions. We've set up an inbox. So we probably, I guess rich, we may have 20 kicking around. I guess I don't know exactly how many. Yeah, quite a lot especially.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  When you include the it service desk and your marketing, you know, inbox and everything else. Yeah, that's correct?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  And we may want to consolidate those if we had a more sort of sensible, I mean, so, for example, the courses which is our admissions team, the accommodation at, and the transport at email are essentially answered by a group of people who all sit in a room together. So, in principle, you know, you might not need all three of those if we had a better way to manage it, but that is how we've traditionally managed it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  I suppose I would say Rakesh, the other thing to, I don't perceive we get lots of criticism about not answering our customers. So I think the team worked really hard to do it. It's just, I don't think it's not efficient at all. And I think we probably put individuals managing an inbox under quite a lot of pressure to get through a big inbox when there will probably be better ways to do that. So, And certainly, these course ones in the last few weeks where we've had things that are definitely not being answered which doesn't look great on us. I think.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. Yeah, that's fair. Not necessarily that we are missing on the conversations but this has more to do with, is that the best way or the efficient way to work on those or can we save a lot of time and obviously have to have reports on top of it? Okay? I hear that now, apart from that, when the top management did bring this to your notice that there should be a better way to deal with these inboxes courses at the rate inbox for admissions team. And then we may have transport at the rate or accommodations at the rate inbox for those general inquiries about X y Z, any timelines that we're looking at to fix these problems or to make this process more efficient? Or are we more into a discovery that we're trying to look at the solutions but things are still okay. The way they're moving ahead. I mean, it's not a, very, you know, urgent need at the moment.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  There is a level of urgency to it, but it is a process where things do work. So, I think we don't kind of suddenly put things on overnight. You know, something we'd put into our project plan and say, right? We're going to change this, but I think there's a recognition that this is something we do want, to really seriously change if we can find the right solution and it's something that rich and team can manage within our portfolio.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But there is as such no timeline, right? I mean, as long as we find a solution, we validate that we put that across to the management, there'll be a decision around it however, it's not that, hey, by quarter fours next year, we have to have a solution or there's as such, no timeline. Is that the right understanding?

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Is that your understanding rich?

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  I mean, yeah, I haven't been given a strict deadline but at the same time, I have been asked to do this piece of work because obviously, it's become sensitive that we've been getting queries about courses and they've not been being answered or, you know, capital. And so, yeah, I think sooner rather than later, but of course, I understand that if it's the right product, it might take a while to implement. I do understand that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And a,

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  change of culture also potentially.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. And Richard, since you head the it services, can I understand from the past experience when there has been a procurement of a new software? How does that typically work? I mean, does that follow through a procurement process followed by the it or legal? How does that typically take? What duration of time?

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  Depends on the cost really as to, okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  But yeah, there'll be a supplier onboarding process to ensure that, you know, credit checks are undertaken. And then, you know, really, it's only a couple of weeks for that process to take place. And then, yeah, we move forward to procure. Of course, it does also depend on where fitting in the installation of said product, which will depend on how much input it takes from us. We can sit in our current work schedule. Obviously, Phil's on this call, I don't need to speak for him to say that he's incredibly busy at the moment. We'd be key in installing this. So obviously currently working on exams and some software implementation, but yeah, we try and fit it in our timeline, probably early next year, would, you know, or spring term next year? At least I would suggest.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. All right. I think I have pretty much good understanding of the current workflow. What I'm going to do is maybe if you guys don't mind share my screen and give you guys a quick walkthrough on hiver, and of course, answer all of those questions with regards to management of multiple inboxes, the courses, one in particular, and see if this is a good product. I mean, Jaeson, I'll appreciate a lot of your questions, but let me first of all, give you a quick walkthrough on the product.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right, guys. Please confirm. If you're able to see my screen. I'm logged in into app hiver web interface. I can. Yeah. Okay, great. Now, if you notice hiver is an AI powered customer support solution. I mean in your case, it could be a student support solution which look like an outlook interface. All we need to do is once we set up hiver, we go to app hiverhq as a web interface. I am logged in using my outlook credentials. So this is my outlook logins for test account. And I'm assuming your admissions team typically have their own sort of logins into outlook. So everybody like seven, eight people they're managing the admissions inbox today or maybe courses at the rate inbox, they've got their own logins in outlook. Is that the right understanding that's.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  correct. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So they would simply log in into hiver, authenticating just one time activity using their own logins. We're not creating any new login for their account. And the very first thing that you would notice here is the personal inbox on the top under conversations. Now, this is personal inbox, which is any email coming into Rakesh at hiver. And then in your case, if Richard personally gets an email, I would manage all of those in the personal inbox. And these personal emails are private to myself. I'm not sharing these emails with anybody else in the team at the same time. If you notice I'm a part of these multiple inboxes. Now, these are going to be the shared inboxes in hiver. Now, the actual connection is still going to be the same ecosystem in your outlook interface, like you have accommodations at the rate inbox today or you've got courses at the rate inbox today. All of that would still remain intact in your outlook. We are simply going to be using hiver to connect to those inboxes, which meaning your existing outlook account, it could be a user account or a distribution list, or even if it is maybe an assured mail type inbox, we would simply use that email address and connect it. Let me give you a quick example on maybe courses inbox. Now, when we connect the shared inbox from your outlook into hiver, you would have all the new emails coming into the unassigned hiver automatically understands and assigns the conversation to the right representative in your team. The slas would start to trigger, when is the earliest that we need to reply to this customer? Open the conversation. And from the activity panel, you decide which representative has to work on it. If it is not auto assigned by hiver, or if we manually need to read the question and understand the context about it, that's where I'll go ahead and own the conversation. So this is where I own the ownership of the ticket and then status by default is open. So we have got pending and closed looking at what the context is, how soon I'm progressing on this request about the tags. Hiver tags can be utilized in multiple fashions. Where for an example, if this query is about an admission, I can go ahead and use a tag called admission. And I would say, okay, this looks like an admission to a specific course. I can go ahead and tag this conversation under admission. Or I would say this has more to do with the billing query, or if it's something to do with the claims email priority by default. These are actually the custom fields. So you could say what course type? Is this, I mean, is this a course type a BC? And then I got to choose, is this a high priority? All of those could help you to organize the data? Better. Also when I need to talk to my other colleagues, I need to get some approval. Let's say I needed to say, hey, Cole, can you help me with this one? I would simply go ahead and add, mention them in the notes section without having to forward these emails or when I'm replying to a query from a student, I don't have to keep my entire team in CC because I want them to be aware of it. Now with hiver when you own the conversation and you talk to your colleagues with the at mentioning dropping them, the notes and comments that's where I could just simply go ahead and collaborate internally and replying to emails. Now, before I do that, if you notice, when I assigned a conversation to myself, you would have noticed that the unassigned dropped down. And now mine section says that these are the two emails Rakesh is working on. Now, this is first response overdue. This is resolution overdue. Both of them are delayed response. I open this one up, look at what the context is about. And then apart from that, when I'm replying, the replies can actually go from the actual shared email address, which could be our courses at the rate email address. Your users can have their own signatures at the bottom. Then you can make use of templates because these nature of queries keep popping up every now and then. So I can use these templates to write to these customer questions or the student questions or with regards to their repetitive nature of queries. And then with the AI compose, I can simply go ahead and, you know, make it more professional short. However you want to do that and let's see if this is a typical query which is a long email chain. You could always summarize the conversation. Now, this is very handy when I have maybe, you know, a cumbersome situation, either I have to go through the entire email chain. Hiver can actually help you decode that. You can save this as a note, share this conversation with anybody else in the team. If somebody else has to work on it or if I am new, let's say if I'm not very sure if this is the right response, I could make use of a template for an example. This one and I can save this template and draft it with my colleagues. Now, this is saving and sharing a draft with other folks in the same courses team that can actually go ahead, make further changes to the draft. Maybe. Help me improvise on the answer and that's when I can go ahead and, you know, simply reply to the client, send a query, close the conversation. And I'm done with the conversation. So all the closed tickets would actually move into the closed bucket for your team. Any questions on a typical journey of a conversation that starts from unassigned, automatically assignment would happen, mine would see all the tickets that I need to work on. And from team section, I would see how many other folks are working on what sort of requests I see. Cole is not in today, but he still has three questions. These are the three queries he's working on. One of them is on ad hoc request. Another is escalation about account payables, maybe something to do with recourses. Other tags are right there. I can go ahead and choose the ownership to myself because Cole is unavailable. And now I can go into the mine section, start work on those. So that's how you could go ahead and have a complete visibility and a team collaboration in one interface.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any thoughts, Richard and Jaeson?

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  It makes perfect sense to me. If I send that response, I close it off, it goes into the close. Then the person then replies to me with a further question. Would it bring all that data back up? And.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  put it absolutely. That email chain will be threaded and hiver automatically opens that case and puts it into the mine section because you're still the owner of the conversation. Let's say you are going to take a day off and you're not online, then the next conversation will move to the unassigned and the next best representative from your team can still look at the entire context, summarize, the conversation, own that up and reply to the customer. But you're right? Whenever there's a new reply on a conversation which is ongoing which was closed because you resolved it. If there is a new question, it will again open up in the mine section for you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I don't have any.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Questions at this stage.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Under all the tags, you want to find out how many urgent tickets do you have? Jason? You don't have to go talk to your entire team. You would just simply search for a tag. Urgent. It will pull up these many conversations and you would see which representative is working on it and why is this urgent? Similarly? You want to find out anything to do with the admission? There is no such conversation which is happening on the admission for now. So these tags will help you categorize and pull on all the escalations, just in one click. Okay. These are the six escalations emails of your working as a team. You notice that couple of them are already been assigned to folks and these are already, you know, owned by these multiple team members in your team. So it is very easy for you to go run any sort of conversation through your entire team and would have to have like a complete visibility under all views except open pending, mine, team, closed conversations. You particularly want to work on a level of tickets which are assigned to just yourself. You would say all the emails which are either open or pending because Rakesh is working on it. You will find out the ones which are urgent. I can go ahead and say these are Rakesh's urgent emails, meaning I can go ahead and save such views, customize these views without moving into all of these. I can particularly find. These are the Rakesh's urgent tickets in one quick view and I can go ahead and sort my emails accordingly. And these could be different transportation inquiries. You could have multiple views with regards to different accommodation type request, what courses are they inquiring the most about? Is that information technologies that agree culture, all of those could happen through the tags and on the basis of different views, we can help you sort those emails in a much better fashion for your team.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any questions? Any doubts by far?

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  No. The only thing for me is I do have to leave when the meeting ends at half past.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. I.

Richard Lynn (richard.lynn@sparsholt.ac.uk):
  don't know if Jaeson and Phil can stay on a bit longer. I don't know.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Yeah, I can stay on a bit longer. Rakesh. It makes perfect sense to me. Yeah, it's a pretty logical sort of process and seems very slick. I'm interested to know. Do other customers, do they limit the amount of these shared inboxes? I know you've got five here because there's that level of categorizing, you may not need to have 20 different ones or.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yep. I recently onboarded New York university Abu Dhabi and I'll tell you they've been using hiver for over six months now. I think we started back in March or April from the implementation standpoint, they guys use it for operations. They use it for customer. I'm sorry, the student exchange requests, then the general inquiries with regards to again, you know, accommodation transport, their different, you know, expenses with regards to monetary reimbursements and things like it. Now, Jaeson, it is very subjective on what category of emails do we receive today? Number two in the existing ecosystem in your outlook, what different mailboxes do we have now, it makes perfect sense to accommodate, maybe, you know, merge in couple of mailboxes and have one of those like a major inbox, which talks about general inquiries. Because in hiver, you can still go ahead and categorize these requests under the administrative control panel. Let's say if these requests do come into your courses inbox with regards to multiple such courses. So you can go ahead and under the custom field, you can create these different courses. And you can just say, you know, this is course number one, two, three four, five. Similarly under the automations, workflow, let's say, if any conversation come into your general support inbox, you can go ahead and say, because these emails do talk about a specific subject that contains anything to do with the accommodation, I can go ahead and tag that as accommodation, right? So you don't have to create these different mailboxes, you would say, because these emails do talk about such, just simply say, you know, this is admission request or accommodation request. And then you move this request, assign it to a specific representative without having to have a lot of manual back and forth. So you could club multiple inboxes into one main support, generic ones with regards to different courses. Courses inbox is important. Maybe you can have all the admissions and courses related emails go into one inbox. And there is as such no limitation in hiver. So if you look at the setup at the backend, you can create an inbox, whether it's a user account or it's a shared mailbox or a distribution list, it does not matter and you can have multiple such inboxes in hiver. The point is to what extent you want to minimize the effort of having to have multiple inboxes depending upon what different teams do we have? Do we have common users who can overlap into the multiple inboxes? Yes. Absolutely. It's possible. Again, looking at your current scenario, I could always recommend what should be the best support system in terms of. Setup.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  okay. That makes sense. I think from my point of view, when I look at how we do things on a, I guess a strategic level, customer communication, it gives us an opportunity to reconsider all of these comms channels and how we best do it from a customer point of view, which, you know, say, you know, to rich's point earlier, there's two elements to any project. One is the technical side of things and the other is the cultural side of things. So I can imagine that will be something that needs a bit of work from our point of view because we aren't an organization that changes quickly should we say absolutely. But I think there'd generally be a very positive thought process towards this as it would, it only seems to me to make a lot of people's jobs easier.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Indeed. And with the auto assignment, let's say you say all your members in accommodation inbox or admissions or courses inbox are pretty much trained in everything. You could just simply turn on the round Robin, get done with manual assignment of conversations. You don't even have to have one person who would typically, you know, route or triage these conversations, let's say, I would take care of it. If you have specific set of people specialized in working just on the billing escalation matters, you could go ahead and create all of those automation workflows not only from where this email is coming in from, but you can think of the different subject content of the email. What is it about? Automatically tag the email, put that into a different bucket, assign that all of that is under the workflows in the automations. Then is the aliases. If you've got multiple aliases, but you still want to manage just one inbox. The rest of these emails are still treated as aliases for the outside world. These emails can still be routed to the one mail inbox. And then you can have your team members right there. I mean that's where you could go ahead and use the slas, what should be the first response time? The resolution time you might want to say, any email which is with regards to the admission request should be given, maybe, you know, two hours. But other than that, the general requests which are none of the admissions or any urgency can still wait for, you know, eight hours for the first response. That's how you can have multiple slas. And all of that does make a lot of sense when you look at the analytics and that's where the exact magic is like where you see, what conversations are we dealing with from accommodations inbox? How many active new result conversations do we have? Can I sort it for the last 30 days and see the trend in last month? Yes, you can look at the result conversations. You can look at how many active, what is the performance for the entire team in the accommodation inbox? Now, what I also want to care about is let's say in the courses inbox. Can I see what my users are doing? So you've got emails assigned versus emails sent out of these individual inboxes and see what Rakesh is up to into the courses, admission inbox. He got 16 conversations only worked upon six. His average post response time is concerning. And that gives you some data to definitely look at. Are we dealing with certain emails which are definitely harder? Or do we need more trainings? Or do we need more maybe self help collaterals online and then it gives you an opportunity to understand what these emails are about. I mean active new results. These are account payables emails. This is email coming in from our vendor abc, that helps us with xyz. These are the escalation emails. These are the new admission requests. And that's how you would be able to back that up with by far. When we receive these emails in our courses and admissions inbox. How much is the first response violations? What these violations are all about? Can I further analyze the data and understand what these emails are all about? You've? Got everything inside the analytics and reports. You can customize the reports as per your choice. You can go ahead and export the reports in CSV with regards to these multiple filters. And that is happening from one interface. The best part is it's easy to learn. There is a zero learning curve I would say, and it's one of those systems which… I personally have onboarded my customers in no more than two weeks if I were to be very honest.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Right. Yeah. I mean, it seems like you're connecting to a current system and it seems like the onboard would be quite. I think the cultural change for us would probably be harder than the technical one. But again, like I say, I am a naturally optimistic person, but I think that… most people would look at this and think actually this would make things more organized and better. And, you know, as you say, I think the hiver… automatically assigning would probably be quite accurate because I think people are, it's very obvious that someone's asking about accommodation or a course request or I don't think it's particularly complicated to do that assignment pretty correctly across the board. And certainly with our stuff, we get into my inbox. So, you know, can I just change my event booking for the open day? Can I, it's a lot of that sort of things that we get. So, okay, no, it's you know, it is what I look like from your website. Does a pretty good job to tell me about it because I'm you've shown me no surprises and it's very slick the way it works?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  So, what's the next step if it was something we wanted to put a proposal to our senior leadership team to, what do we need to do, Rakesh, and what sort of, you know, we should look at pricing and what else we need to do technically, et cetera. Sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Now, I've got a couple of steps here again looking at how it works and what are the different, you know, approaches that you happen to follow on? Number one could be, of course, go straight off with the pricing. And I can share a quick deck on hiver and the value proposition because I've anyways recorded this conversation. But trust me nobody's going to go watch a 30 minutes recording. So I would go ahead and put that in a snippet like say around two or three minutes of a quick video and a product deck. Now, with regards to the commercials and pricing, does that make sense? That we set up a test account, help you test the platform, you bring in a couple of your folks from admissions and banks or your courses and banks. And with the complete use cases, we go back to the management or do you think we first need to go ahead, get the approvals, get the it and security vetting done only then it makes sense for us to kind of, you know, test a platform.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Honestly, don't know. It's a shame that rich isn't here, Phil. Do you have a view on that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Richard did drop it, but yeah, I look forward to Phil.

Philip Laskowski (philip.laskowski@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  I mean quick… from a technical point of view, does this sit in the cloud or does it sit likely on my machine as an app that I need to install or does it sit in the cloud?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It is a cloud solution and I've got security privacy documents. Everything, everything remain on your outlook servers. By the way, with regards to the hiver setup, I can share all the information that's needed on security standpoint. One thing for sure, we are GDPR compliant. We are soc one two, we take security parameters, very, seriously. And number two, we don't access customer data at all unless it is, it has been escalated to technical team and our team wants to maybe troubleshoot something. Otherwise, the data remains on your outlook. The idea is Philip that the master account that's there on your outlook is not touched at all. Everything still routes through your outlook servers.

Philip Laskowski (philip.laskowski@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Okay. So it's like a simplified email interface? Is that how I understand?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. We are simply helping your teams to better view, manage, organize your emails and the account still remains on your outlook. You still have the control to it.

Philip Laskowski (philip.laskowski@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Okay. Any user data that you do store, where would that get stored?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We have got Aws servers. I think we located in the us. I'm not very particular about the locations. I can check that for you, but that's certainly not in european continent for sure. I mean, is that a no, no for you?

Philip Laskowski (philip.laskowski@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  I wouldn't say it's a no, no. It's more of a, I'd have to basically ask you to send us over the… information like the GDPR, the privacy and all that stuff that you have. I will definitely because I need to sort of run that past our GDPR manager.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. I'll go ahead and send all the security documents, terms of services, privacy documents with you guys. All right. And Jaeson. I believe once we internally wet, this should be the first step to see if this all tick all the boxes with regards to having to have a solution like hiver into the premise that's number one. And once we get some fair idea, I think we can always catch up in about two, three days from now to see what the next steps would look like. I think these are two parallel conversations we can run in my understanding, Jaeson, let's run the it security wedding with the documents that I'm going to be sharing with you guys. And in parallel, you can talk to your top management and say this is what hiver has to offer as a product. And this is a value proposition. We're looking at, let us know what all different teams and how many members are we looking at for now? Because the next step is once it says, yes, everything looks good, we're going to be going ahead with a quick test and implementation, which is more like testing on a shared inbox. Inviting people. I can invite one of my onboarding managers to assist us with the setup. And then we look at the progress on hiver.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  That seems to make sense. I think, yeah, we, there is a parallel process so, you know, we can't do anything until our colleagues in it say, yes, this all works from a compliance and everything as I'm sure every client is like that. And I'm more than happy, I think my team would be happy enough to test this in our shared inbox, which is one of the less critical ones. And I know we manage really well, but it's certainly I have a diverse group of people in my team who are, would be a good sample of, our whole college as it were. So there'd, be a good representative of people and how they took to it and managed it. So more than happy at that, I think, yeah, and understanding that, you know, the proposition and the cost base would be very valuable because I think until we, I know I sit down with rich and I share a boss and the first question should be okay, I trust that you guys know this is what we want. How much does it cost?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Understood. Yeah, that would.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Be where it comes down to in, you know, is this something we can afford to do? And that makes sense for us financially?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely, absolutely. Just for the sake of conversation. So I can internally hold that we offer different plans by the way.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And it totally depends upon how many shared mailboxes we're looking to manage. Now, let's say if you're looking to manage three inboxes, we're looking at a growth plan that still does slas, different custom fields, different base of automations, workflow, like a standard platform product, which is a growth product and it's a per user login pricing. So let's say if you're looking at admissions inbox courses inbox with a, with say around six to 10 people, then we're going to be looking at this plan. But for an example, you're looking at multiple mailboxes, say five inboxes or beyond five inboxes. So this plan allows you to create up to five inboxes, you can have beyond 10 people. And this is again, per login. We do annual. We also do month on month should you just want to, you know, continue with monthly for now and then move on to the annual that's also possible. This plan only comes into picture when you say there are inboxes but that's that are infinite say around you have got 20 mailboxes and you want advanced skill based routing, you want hipaa compliance right there. I don't think that is needed because we work with universities and all of that. So I would say choosing between these two plans and still starting with this plan and moving on to this plan is also very much easy. You don't really need anybody's assistance. It's just like right from the billing dashboard, you can choose to do that. So on top of it, I would say we offer 20 percent straight off discount to universities and educational institutions. So think about like a promotion that we can do on top of this, you know, listed pricing, this is just for your reference.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  So, for my clarity, so let's say we were just doing this for my marketing team. So we have one marketing inbox, and I have seven people in my team who may look at that. So I'd be looking at seven times 25 per month. Is that right? Is that how I'm understanding it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  OK. Yes. Now, since the pricing is going to be in the buckets for users. So we start with two users, five users, 10 15. So you're looking at 10 licenses for growth, essentially no more than 250 dollars a month, which includes the entire setup, no onboarding cost, nothing as such. So essentially 250 dollars a month, if I were to put that.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Right. I've got it. OK. Yeah. So, so because I don't have any sense as to how many people and how many shared inboxes across the business in detail. I mean, I think as I say, my team, there's seven in my team and we all look after our marketing inbox, but actually the admissions team there's actually, I guess there's only five or six of them that would do that. So, you know, it's that sort of. So what I probably need to do Rakesh is try and assess… all of those inboxes and users.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Yeah. So would let's say I've got let's say I have someone in my team that would also look at the admissions inboxes. They count as one. In that context. They're just one. Yeah. OK.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  He'll be an overlapping user. He can, he can be a part of marketing as well as the admissions, but these are not two logins. It's one user at the end of the day. So the,

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  pricing essentially then is the number of users that use shared inboxes across the business? Is the, is where we get to our pricing number? OK, that's cool to know. So I'll I think we probably can make a bit of an estimate of that because I think we've got a few of our inboxes have got lots. But yes. OK. That's good. From my point of view.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Can I go ahead and maybe do a 10, 15 minutes quick check in with you on Friday? Maybe? Yeah.

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Let's give that a go. Let's give that a go. Rakesh. Unfortunately, I have to jump off. I've got something else just coming up. This is good. But let's do a catch up on… Friday?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I had a quick invite on Friday already, Jason. You should have that in your inbox already?

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  OK, lovely. And I will, I'll catch up and see, where we are from there and get a sense, see if I can make any progress on those others.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Let me go ahead and send all the information needed that you could, that you could use, to refer for internal discussions. Thank you for your time, Jason and Philip. I would look forward to talking to you again should there be anything else that you require you've. Got my email address. I'm going to be dropping a thank you note after this meeting. Feel free to write back please?

Jaeson Middleton (jaeson.middleton@sparsholtservices.ac.uk):
  Brilliant. Thanks, Rakesh. It's really good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you. Bye. Awesome. Thank you.
