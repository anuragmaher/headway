================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hi, Erin. Good morning.

EXACT Sports:
  Good morning. How are you very?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Well, thank you. How are you doing?

EXACT Sports:
  I'm doing, very well. Thanks for jumping on this call and letting me know about hiver. I'll just let you know. My sort of my marching orders were to buy my bosses who are very, they're very techie people. They're very, I work, I'm head of customer service. So I'm not really in the world of tech. I don't really, they're much more and they sort of just want me to go window shopping and sort of see any tools that we can use for exact sports and how we can make life easier for our customers as well as for my customer support team. Cause right now, we're kind of in the process of growing but I don't think the technology we have is helping us out that much. We're getting a bit overwhelmed by the amount of emails and questions. So, just excited to learn about what your guys' platform does and how it can help us.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Definitely, definitely. And thank you so much for joining again. And let me quickly introduce myself before we begin discuss about business. My name is Rakesh and I take care of sales at hiver. I've been with the company for over four years, have personally onboarded more than five other teams. You're in good hands. The exact request that you mentioned about overwhelming with customer queries, be it, these are phone calls or coming in from different web forms which have been filled on your website or these emails do come directly to your shared inboxes. We've got that covered for you as well as, you know, the chats on the website or maybe the bots, chatbots, and the self help knowledge base, which is very prominent through an AI where these users, whether these parents do contact you or if coaches contacted you, how can they self help themselves before they even, you know, submit a ticket? So we've got all of that and I'll let you know about it before we begin. Can I understand, I mean, I won't just be double short about it. All the emails are been routed to your Google workspace. I mean, that's the email provider we.

EXACT Sports:
  use today. Yeah, yeah, we have two, we have two gmails that I think are we primarily would probably start on the one Gmail that's our like main director inbox, which is we have sort of two brands. The one brand has the physically most amount of emails, just sheer volume of emails that we get, but it is on Gmail. And the other one that's also on Gmail is a smaller brand, but still gets a lot of emails that… we sort of operate out of.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Now. Let me go back and understand your exact workflow today. Let's say if I'm a coach and I want to contact you for any sort of support that I require for one of my tennis teams for perhaps, where do I reach out to? I mean, is there a common inbox email address like something like support at the rate or how do I contact you folks?

EXACT Sports:
  So we, I would say I'm more on the athlete side than I am on the coach side. So, the coaches are we have people who are coach relations, they have, you know, biz dev and building those relationships and all of that. And they're usually what we do is if we get an email in our support inbox from anything from a coach that gets forwarded to our coach specialists, that is, I sort of I wipe my hands of the, if you can believe it. College coaches are sometimes our big personalities. So I wipe my hands clean. They go over there. We actually mostly deal with. And what this inbox would mostly deal with is customers. So people who are signing up for our camps, signing up to attend our trips on the customer facing side as opposed to with the coaches.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. So these are the customers by the way that you deal with setting up on camps trips and everything. And what's the common inbox email address that they reach out to?

EXACT Sports:
  It would be an inbox. It's a director at exact sports.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, director at the rate inbox very clear and how big is the team that manages the entire inbox? And you lead that one?

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah, we've got including myself, I'd say about four, four or five people. I think we're onboarding somebody right now. So about four or five people.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. And when I'm trying to understand how overwhelming it becomes today, what are the volume that we deal with today? I'm just trying to find out how do we deal with these emails currently? What volume do we deal with today?

EXACT Sports:
  I think the volume depends on because this director inbox is also used by the marketing team. So they send out invitations. And then people respond to those invitations and it'll come back into the director inbox. Pretty much everything is routed through the director inbox. So volume wise, it's not only prospective customers but it's also people who have already registered. So it's like this. It's both it's like people who are interested in the camp and want basic questions as well as people who are already signed up and have more sort of intricate questions. I'd say upwards of maybe 200 emails. I would say, that's a safe number around 200 emails. And as of right now, I think one of the issues is we don't really have a ticketing system.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  which could be a difficult stance for you to kind of go into reports analytics and understand what volume do we deal with? Fair enough? Hundreds of emails in a day? Does sound like a little too much for a team of four to five folks. And as long as if you look at a solution and it does help you with the operational efficiencies, I would say should there be a system in place that can deflect certain tickets which are automatic in nature? We don't really require people to brainstorm, but these are repetitive nature of tickets should be used on templates or AI, should be able to resolve all of that. And second set of emails that actually require a lot of man strength. You go ahead and allocate these tickets to the right set of people. Let's say, Rakesh takes care of the trips organized by the company versus erdin looks at anything with regards to the campaigning requests and all of that like anything to do with the camps and all. So we have got ways to efficiently triage those emails without having to have a lot of manual intervention. Now, looking at your current workflow, do you want to tell me like all four or five folks that you have got today, do they all log in into director inbox with a common password or do you personally log in and you forward emails to these folks? And then they manually look at it? Yeah.

EXACT Sports:
  We're in the business of password sharing, we sort of right now have like a vague schedule so that there aren't just four people in the inbox at the same time. People are on at different times and sort of we have one who she logs on. She logs off. She comes in, she cranks out like 50 emails and then she logs off. So we kind of have people with different schedules. But, yeah, password sharing right now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. And does that even create a confusion on understanding who is already working on the tickets versus already done with it? Or do you also face challenges when systems sometimes blocks and say, hey, you cannot have a concurrent way of logging together like all four or five of us sharing a password, which goes against the Google policy.

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah, we've we have right now, I think well, it actually was a big scare. One of our, one of our employees, not one of our customer support specialists but another employee in the customer got hacked. Their email got like cybersecurity wise. So we had to bolster up those passwords a little bit more, which was a bit of a headache, but, you know, that's all in the past now, which is another thing of like, yeah, we've right now that our big solution was just making a more complicated password, which is, I think that's naive to think that that's gonna protect us. But the other thing that like you said like consistency right now, something that really our system doesn't really help is if I respond to an email at say I work from this hour to this hour, and then you take the shift after me. If I respond to an email and then somebody asks a question I respond. And then when you're on shift, they respond to an email and then you respond to that email. I don't like how people will have like four or five different customer support specialists at the same time. And we've tried to figure out a system of like maybe we just lie and say, even though it's you answering, you say that you're me just because people are like having three different people respond.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And I'm thinking out loud because this is not the first time I'm hearing this. How about we all have an access to the team inbox from our individual logins in Gmail. Now, Aaron replies goes out of the login logout shift, Rakesh joins in. There is a customer request. I pull that email up and I also reply using the same directors at their email address with a common team signature. But still in the backend, we know that Rakesh owned this reply versus Aaron replied in the very first go in. Should there be a complete transparency? Because let's say third day we both are on a day off, somebody else has to step in, should have a clear visibility on what different conversations did we already go through? And for customer, it's no confusion that these are the different individuals but still hail from a common team, which is support at the rate or directors at the rate inbox. Email? Yeah.

EXACT Sports:
  That's something we've looked at. The thing is right now, are they, I shouldn't say we don't track their emails but we've just, you know, in theory, somebody could say you were a not so stellar employee and you decided to just you log in, you clock your hours, but then you just don't respond to any emails like over the course of a few weeks, I could see my God, he's not responding to any emails but he's clocking six hour work days that's.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  just, you know?

EXACT Sports:
  Performance wise. But if, yeah, if there is a way that, you know, it's still said that you were responding to emails even though I was the one answering just for consistency wise, but there is still a way to track that. I sent this email. You sent that email. I don't really care about the numbers more of, I just care about that. People aren't trying to skim us off the top.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Which, yeah.

EXACT Sports:
  I love my team, but again, this is something we have to as a manager you have to have.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. I couldn't agree any more with this. I mean, of course, as long as you have got analytics, you have got certain reporting at the backend which tells you whether or not Rakesh is responding to these emails assigned to him, if they are responding. And if these are important requests, is there a time that we can trigger or run on top of those emails? We call it SLA in a typical technical language which is a service level agreements. I know these emails cannot be or might not be very time sensitive, but there should be a science behind it to understand. If an email comes in, we have got an SLA of replying to these emails in four hours. If this ticket is assigned to Rakesh, is there a specific reason he's unable to reply to these emails in less than four hours? If not, then of course, we can find out the ones which are already flagged to you, Aaron. So we have got a way to deal with it and it's obviously, I mean, it's not about pinpointing on fingers and somebody in the team, but it's more to do with the operational efficiencies. And of course, when we place everything in your workflows, I would automatically try and see, you know, these are the tasks which are assigned to me. Why don't? I just simply reply to all of those emails. There's no way I can escape on logging in every day but not replying or working on the tickets. Because there'll be a couple of clear dashboard you'll have an access to and you'll quickly see how many and what emails have been done? How many of them are still open pending closed. You could see all of that now, apart from the email management that's happening in your directors at the written box. What are the different other ways or modes of communication that you care the most to manage?

EXACT Sports:
  In terms of communication right now, we don't have, we have, I have a company phone. And right now one of our biggest brands is our international trips where we, you know, kids who have attended our camps before and, you know, we're good athletes and we felt could be good in traveling abroad with us. We have a trip that we go abroad and those trips athletes I'll talk to on the or those parents mostly I like to talk to on the phone. I give them this phone number. It's not a phone number that's available on our website. It's something that I have to schedule a call and we're working through the process of maybe having a Google meet under or like a, something that we can make it so that I can talk to people these, I mean these kids are being sent abroad, the parents want to know that there's a person to talk to for the camps, their day camps. I have no problem with those being more email based because you have the day camp, it's not as big of a commitment. So right now, it's just email and I think it would be something maybe down the line, but we might have like another system in terms of this might just be me setting up phone calls on my own personal calendar that doesn't really have much to do with hiver, that being said though these requests would be coming in through the director inbox. So there could be some sort of setup there.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. Yeah, I mean something which is absolutely not important at this point in time, but hiver does support phone calls. So as long as we establish a process and we have your call as a service provider from within the same interface that you're managing your directors at the right inbox emails, your team can pretty much manage the phone calls. Now, that becomes a point where we have so many calls happening. But today, you're okay to deal with it on your mobile phone, which I completely get it now. Given that Erin, if we happen to solve all of these problems, do you want to tell me when soon do you want to fix them? I mean, are there certain timelines that you're looking at today?

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah. Right now, we're sort of ramping up the fall and winter seasons are in comparison to the summer. Our summer season is like, it's like our version of tax season. What tax season is to an accountant, the summer is to our camps because we just summer's our huge month. We have a bunch of camps coming up but summer's kind of our hail Mary. So we'd like to have a fully fleshed out system by summer where my team can be onboarded, understand it. We also can, I know there's growing pains and sort of like we have to kind of like shift and see if, you know, if we go with hiver. Okay. We've got you. How do we then make it work? It's best for us both on your end, on our end, what we need to do what needs to get changed. But this is sort of something where my bosses gave me like this is like my quarterly project is to check out all this technology, see what can be provided and kind of figure it out from there. So I'd say quarterly within the next few weeks or so.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. Yeah, I mean, and if there's a solution which is easy to use, that requires zero learning curve, we don't even really need to, you know, totally, you know, interfere with your existing workflows where we are not changing the way you guys are working today. We're just implementing something on top of it without requiring a lot of learning curves and everything. Then probably we're even looking at sooner. So all I wanted to know is that we are open for it. We are open to testing it. It's not a project for, you know, 20 26 or so because by then we are probably looking at a solution a little too early for something which is as simple as hiver. And then by 26, you would see there's so much that we have already developed. So fair enough. All right. And apart from your side, is there anybody else who will help you make a decision? Who will be the final authority to sign this project off?

EXACT Sports:
  I believe the final would probably be my direct manager and then the two, both the founder of exact. And then I think, I don't I think he started calling himself CEO. I don't know what he, I think he calls himself the national director. He changes it up all the time, but probably, those three would be sort of the three people and like they're very techie, they're very, he, I mean, my boss Barry, he would have a field day on these demo calls. He loves this kind of stuff. So any, like I guess from your end, any materials that you can provide in terms of like just your best, even just like or your best just like technology deck of like here's what it is here's, how it works, flashy images. The whole nine would be great for me to show him because, you know, that's kind of what I want to say.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I get it. I get it. Fair enough. Now. I have pretty much everything that I needed to know before I could actually present hiver because I've got so much to show. I'm not fond of showing all 100 things which may not really make any sense. I would rather stick to the ones which are absolutely needed in your use cases now. And also regarding the collateral, the actual deck, I would share that with you so that you can present this internally to your MD. And obviously the decision makers post our meeting. I can also trim the recording of our conversation just for the product demo and we'll just avoid the actual discovery conversation because they don't have time to kind of go over our 30 minutes recording. Now, if you notice I am logged in into my Gmail account. And I'm hoping all your customer support folks that their individual emails like you've got Erin at the rate exact support. Is that the right understanding that everybody has their own logins on Gmail?

EXACT Sports:
  No, I have my own login the other, they are freelance. So we set them up. They use the director inbox, password and username but it'll just when you're on Gmail, there's something at the bottom saying there's two people on this account right now. They, they're all using that one.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So in hiver, it's a prerequisite that everybody has their individual logins only then the system would work. So that's one thing to note that we need to have all four or five logins created apart from yourself. And the reason is because when I'm logging into my Gmail, I have this hiver extension running. It's a Chrome extension. And anything that you see in yellow on top of my Gmail screen is hiver here. So I manage my personal inbox emails right from the top. So anything sent to Erin at the rate inbox or a cash out, I see these emails in the personal inbox. The way I pretty much manage my own private emails and we are not sharing with anybody in the team at the same time. If you notice this inbox, the director support. So this is going to be the shared inbox for all the users logging into their individual Gmail accounts. Manage the common inbox, which is a team inbox in a collaborative space. Here. Now, this inbox, we will actually connect with your existing email address that is already present in your Google workspace called directors at the rate your exact sports. Com. Now we will not change anything with regards to our exact setup in the Google workspace. We would rather simply use the email address and connect it in hiver so that you have new requests coming into the unassigned view. Here. Now, when all five users are also added to the same director support, shared inbox. Everybody has a complete visibility on how many requests are there with regards to any customer… requests which are not attended at the moment. So these are the brand new emails. I open the email. I look at what the context is, and this activity panel will help me decide if I need to assign it to myself or anybody in my team or we can simply go ahead and turn on the auto assignment at the backend, which ensures as long as I log in into my Gmail and I keep myself online, hiver automatically routes the email to me as a first time login. The second email goes to Aaron, third goes to John, fourth goes to Mary, and that's how hiver can allocate these emails in a round Robin fashion on automatic basis. Given that you are not available and you don't want to take care of so much of manual intervention to assign tickets to each other. You would see that automatically emails will be assigned into the mind section for that representative.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So in the mind section, I would see all the emails.

EXACT Sports:
  Oh, sorry. I was just saying, yeah, one of the big issues we have is sometimes we'll… have our two customer support specialists that are both eager beavers. We've had times where two people have responded to the same email and saying that this would ensure that like only you received this email or only I received this email and we both can't respond to the same email.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely, because that's where the ownership is for now. Once I assign it to myself, this actually moves out of unassigned folder. And immediately this email moves to the mind section here. Now, if I notice, I would simply care about what's happening in my inbox because that's the one which was assigned to me as a shared email.

EXACT Sports:
  Gotcha.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And from the team section, Aaron, you would have a complete visibility on how many total requests are opened up for your team. So, if you look at the team section right here, you would notice how many total requests are opened up, and what is the complete distribution of workloads? So amongst all your folks in your customer support, how many of them are working on? What sort of open ticket requests at this point in time? Now, this gives me a clear visibility. If Cole is actually working on three tickets and he is on a day off today, you've got an option to simply pick these emails up and reassign it to Rakesh without forwarding these emails to me manually. I could go ahead and simply go ahead and say, you know, Rakesh, you're online, let me just forward these emails. Let me assign these emails to you. Now, Rakesh in the mind section, if you notice I've got these five requests that I need to work on?

EXACT Sports:
  Gotcha. So, is there a way that we can have like… yeah, say you have the day off and it's assigned a bunch of emails to you. Is there a way we can even avoid that of like, oh,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  yeah, you?

EXACT Sports:
  Would say I'm off today and it wouldn't even touch.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  If you notice I have a way option, so if I keep myself away, I can go ahead and unassign the conversations and these conversations can land into the unassigned bucket so that anybody who's online can pick these emails up or hiver's round Robin automations can really assign these emails to the agents online. So I can choose to say, when I'm away, hiver doesn't need to assign tickets to me.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right now, as a manager, you have the availability to control your team here. So under the team section availability here, you could even get to see how many folks are online on tickets today, how many of them are actually taking care of chats. So even you can go ahead and manage their availability as an administrator or the manager of the team inbox. Apart from that, any email that we deliberately keep in pending, I'll show that to you, we'll move to the pending, the ones which are already done. We have resolved the queries, we'll move to the closed bucket. So none of these emails are actually going to be lost at all. You have these multiple views to manage the data better. And then as long as you see these number of emails in the team section, this clearly tells you that there are 23 tickets that we need to work as a team tickets which are assigned to Rakesh, and the one request which has not been assigned to anybody. And that's what gives you a complete visibility for the entire day as to what's happening at any point in time. Now, for an example, I open this one up, I look at what the ticket request is all about. If this is a complicated long email request, I can go ahead and summarize the conversation with one click, hiver will actually generate the entire decode of it. We'll tell you what the email is actually about. And on basis of it, you assign ticket to your colleague or hiver automatically assigns an email for an example, somebody asking for a new camp request. So all the camp requests should go to Rakesh. So assign it to him and it can automatically be tagged also that it is a campaigning based request. So I can go ahead and use the tags and I can tell hiver, AI tagging any request that talks about camp booking or about any location. Xyz, whatever those, you know, parameters could be because you guys have been dealing with these emails, you would know what fashion this email does follow. So I can give an, you know, a quick way to let hiver create those tags and tag those emails particularly. And all of this, you also have an option to triage emails, whether it's a high priority email or if it is an email type about camps or is that a type two email? Which is more to do with the different trips? So you go ahead and triage the data and organize it better, right from here.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect. Yeah, we've got some right now, we have in Gmail, just we're just using labels and I just when I log on.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah, we would. So I'll tell you one thing these labels are personal for you, right? I mean, you're going to be using these labels, you're triaging it into multiple folders. But these tags are shared with all four of you, five of you guys. And the best way to use it, how I look at it every day, let's say, I want to find out how many escalations am I dealing with? I'll go to the tag label called escalation, and it'll tell me this is one escalation which is unresolved already been assigned to Rakesh, something to do with the billing query. Otherwise, how many requests are urgent? I don't have any urgent unresolved at the moment. So I can go ahead and, you know, search for all of these requests just under the tags.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, apart from that, looking at these emails, actually working on these emails are going to be straightforward, very simple. All the Gmail functionalities will remain as it is. Apart from that, you want to find a way to collaborate with your team. For an example, you want to talk to your colleagues. You can just simply without forwarding an email at mention, your colleague, Cole and say, hey, Cole, can you get this one solved? And this is how you can go ahead and, you know, talk to your colleagues without forwarding emails to each other. So this is basically just like at mentioning each other, dropping them, the notes or comments and having to have multiple people talk to each other while you reply to a customer request.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Apart from that, if you want to find out any workflow with regards to the approvals. Maybe trip is coming on and you need to get some approvals from your MD who doesn't need to be a part of this inbox, but you can always choose to create an approval flow. For an example, a discount approval flow, you would just route the email through the approval flow. This will actually send an email to the person in question that, hey, there is an email where Erin is asking for an approval, they will approve of it. And you would see that right here instead of pending, it would show approved.

EXACT Sports:
  Gotcha.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Apart from that, not only you can talk to your other four colleagues in the customer support. If you even want to talk to your finance Guy, you can just at mention their complete email address at mention them, drop them the note. They will get an email in the inbox for the collaboration on this specific ticket. They would not have the access to the entire inbox as such, but they can still coordinate. Think about maybe MD needs to do off or you want to just coordinate with the managing director or the technical director as such.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, you've got open pending closed ticket statuses. Once I'm done with the ticket request, let's say I'm working on it and I receive so many requests with regards to the refund. So all I do is just simply use the template. I know we joined on the fourteenth of January and that's how you can go ahead and use these regular repetitive nature of queries. If you also want to just simply summarize the conversation, you want to make it more professional empathetic, you've got everything right there to improvise the conversation just like chatgpt, right? Built inside your Gmail. And right from here, you can choose to do that. And while replying, we can always make sure that these emails go out of support inbox. And there is no way to probably in a situation where at the time your colleagues are on day off, nobody else should be able to work. I mean you could absolutely route these emails from your personal. I mean, your directors at the rate inbox email address with the signatures at the bottom.

EXACT Sports:
  Gotcha. Yeah. Right now, we're using streak that's another Chrome tool that we're using. And we've got like a snippet library and we have sort of we're continually adding to it and making you know because there are some questions that we answer over and it's and our team knows those snippets and can crank them out. Would streak also be compatible with this? Or would it be something where we could, we would have to re upload our snippet library. We can.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Help you. Yeah, we can absolutely look into how we could import those into hiver. You don't have to literally then use multiple solutions as such because hiver templates can literally replace the same need. And also, if there is a way we could help using hiver copilot, which is more like finding or drafting responses on behalf of your colleague. And this is where, you know, it would actually be very handy. Let me take you to the admin panel just once. And under hiver AI, you could even say the knowledge sources could be anything to do with those documents. When you upload those documents, any email with regards to those context of those documents, hiver should be able to help you draft those automatic responses. And your teams should be able to simply deflect those responses and use those templates or automatically reply on behalf of your colleagues. So, from here itself, you can just say, hey, can you summarize the conversation or can you help me understand what is the pricing? So I can go ahead and, you know, talk anything to my AI copilot and the data would be on basis of your, you know, repository. So that's how you would, you will be able to kind of generate all the responses.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect. Yeah, we're trying to, our, like our agents can, can handle a lot of, a lot of the, inquiries. And I think I'm usually the one who's handling the escalated circumstances, whether it be like this is something where, yeah, again, you would have to tag to our tech Guy, you would have to go to a director, it would have to, see something. If there was, yeah, a finance issue, I've sort of would act as the liaison for all of that. But it's good to know that, my team could also help me out and flag stuff so that I don't have to go through, and,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  absolutely, as long as you use these functionalities, and your team can actually go ahead and use a tag called escalation, it can actually go ahead and trigger a quick note to you, you'll be able to see all the escalations right in the bell notification here, that will be automatically populated for your review.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Perfect. Apart from that, when I'm done with the response, let's say, I'm going to be going ahead sending this response and closing the ticket. Meaning I'm just resolving all of that. And all the closed emails will actually move into the closed bucket. Now, if your customer chooses to reply, probably in two days down the line, it would again open up in the mind section because remember, we talked about the ownership of the ticket. So I'm still the owner of the ticket. And if I am on a scheduled day off, I keep myself offline only then you would see these new requests coming into the unassigned bucket right? From there.

EXACT Sports:
  Gotcha. Okay. That sounds good. Yeah, we've tried to get into a system of not having like back and forth conversations, with a customer. So if you ask a question, we're hoping that, our responses can be a one and done so that, you know, obviously sometimes people have more complicated situations, but it's good to know there's there can be a consistency.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And all of those situations where a lot of back and forth is happening, you don't have to close the ticket. You would rather keep them in pending because, you know, you're not absolutely resolving it, but you would need some more time on the pending requests can be tracked, right? In the pending section, you would have a complete visibility on which representative is actually keeping these requests in pending, and for what reason because of these tags also.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect. Gotcha. All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, apart from that, you have got so much to do with regards to the basic setup at the back end. Like you can have automations, you can workflow the emails in a way that you don't have to manually assign and triage these emails. For an example, when I go into the director report support inbox, you can turn on the automations here and it would tell you the first email can land into the first Guy's inbox, second could go to the second Guy, third can go to third Guy. All of this could be automated. Otherwise, if you don't want this, you want a very targeted way to reply to those emails and assign these emails, you can create automations. And these automations could be something like as long as new emails coming into your director's inbox. And what you want to do is if the condition talks about specific email that has a specific domain to it, or if it does talk about the subject of the emails, let's say it's a test or then the body of the email also talks about X y Z does contain say, you know, escalation, you want to have refund, any of those as such can be assigned. Okay, let me just go ahead and say, and then add the next step that you need to assign it to a specific representative, say assign it to Rakesh immediately and add a tag also that these are the escalations emails. So it could be just like this is how you could just go ahead and this is an escalation. So this can be all automated. Think about just not subject and test, even imagine if these emails are created past your working hours, outside your working hours. Do you want to then trigger a quick reply to these emails? Like something like, hey, thank you for replying. I, okay, I can just go ahead and say, you know, thank you for replying. This is your ticket number. We are, we are away for the moment and this is how you're going to, you know, go ahead and make sure that these emails are not unattended at any point in time. Gotcha. Yeah, you automatically assign emails to delegate the right people to these emails. And then you add the right set of tags and everything within the automation workflows as such.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect. Yeah, I think we've found that even if we don't answer a question right away, people just like to get an email knowing that they didn't just go into a blackboard.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. These are the autoresponders, thank you note and then conversation id, which is a ticket id for your team. You can have as for the business hours, if you're logging in nine to five, or even if these emails are coming in outside your business hours or during business hours, you can generate these requests for your customers and they're well updated that somebody is actually looking into your requests at the moment.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect. Yeah. And I think maybe this is something you were going to get to later in the demo. So let me know if this is something you're working towards, but we've been looking into the idea of like having an automated response that our agents could go in or our specialists could go in and AI already responded to them. I don't know if we're quite comfortable with AI sending them out without our sort of us approving them. So, is there sort of a tool where you ask a question? The AI provides an answer, and then our agent would go in and go read it and go, that looks good and send it off?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely.

EXACT Sports:
  We've tested with AI tools in the past and that sort of was the process. It was less it was sending the emails but rather it would bank all of them and I would go in and, read it, send, read it, send, make sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It's absolutely. Yeah, there are two ways to look at it. One could be what is the knowledge source through which AI is actually reading the content of the asked email and drafting a response for you? Like I just showed you, if I'm working on this email as a ticket, then I'm actually looking into this hiver co pilot and asking hiver to draft a reply. I'm not manually doing it, not even sending this automatically, but hiver is actually generating this for me. Secondly because hiver understand that this nature of email keeps coming so much while replying, hiver generates or recommends the right set of template. And these templates are going to be the same data resource that you already have in your existing system streak. So hiver can suggest you the automated template which absolutely, you know, resonates with the query of the email because these are repetitive or you could make sure that you ask hiver AI, and on basis of the actual knowledge base, which source we want to refer to with regards to it, hiver can help you generate the response for this. But in all the cases you are deliberately choosing to reply an email, it's not automatically sending responses without you approve it because I understand it's not something to do with, you know, Amazon order like where is my order? Okay. Amazon checks, it says it's been delivered on your doorstep. It's not that transactional. You're still looking into the requests and your team requires intervention. Your team requires a careful edit of drafts or maybe making sure that no two people are responding at the same time and we still need intervention there.

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah, we've especially when we have where we run live events. So any question you can think of for a live event? Yeah. Rarely rarely are two questions about an event the same. We get a lot of the same ones. But rarely, so it would be something where I wouldn't want AI responding. And then for that person to respond annoyed because their question wasn't answered because we were unable to vet it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah. And here on the top here, if you notice these are the slas, like what is the first response? It's already overdue. We haven't been able to respond to this ticket and resolution has been paused because this email is kept in pending. So you have the ways to set it up as per the escalation hours. Also like if I'm into the director's inbox, let me check you through just one more time here in the SLA. I create a policy that all the emails that are coming into my inbox should be responded, no more than four hours in a day and these should be closed in no matter in no more than 24 hours in a day or maybe, you know, it could be eight hours or how many hours you define. So this is where you would trigger a notification to your team that you have got four more hours to reply to these tickets. You've got two hours to reply to these tickets and you need to close this request in no more than eight hours. And that's how you could track the response of these emails. And then we have got analytics where you could absolutely see what category of emails are taking longer than four hours. That's where you could probably, you know, emphasis more, maybe write knowledge based articles, try and understand if these are complicated requests that require more attention.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect. And again, stop me if this is something you were already going to talk about. But one thing that we have is, which is maybe a pro of the system that we're using now, which the system we're using now is just a bunch of people in one inbox. But it's been easier to have a bunch of emails that were say our website is down or our like some something is technically not working. We flagged it to the tech team because our team knew that because we were just receiving a bunch of emails about it, that's usually half the time we find out about a tech issue is because a bunch of people are reaching out to tell us. Is there a way we could get like a summary or a way we could get like sort of a flag that like, well, there's a bunch of emails coming in about this specific thing. And then we can act accordingly because like I said, we do live events. If something happens at a live event, we usually receive a lot of emails about it. And it would be good to know like this is happening. Because if the emails are getting delegated to different people, you could see how maybe like communication could get split. Is there sort of a summary tool?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I would, I can give you the reports on those emails which are coming on during those hours where the systems were down or the systems have been flagged. There are multiple ways to look at it. One could be, we simply use the tag here and we call it downtime. Like however you find comfortable using the tag, right? I can call it downtime. I would say it's a downtime. And then any email that comes in a specific hour, if it does talk about X y Z in the content of the email because these emails would talk about something in very specific, right? Something like, hey, your app is not working or there is a downtime or can you help me with this? So one way we could automatically tag the email and in the reports analytics, I could let you run the entire analytics about those emails in the downtime tagging option. Let me show that to you in the analytics section here. I… have the reports on the tags here. So when I go ahead and analyze any of those reports with a specific tag, I can go ahead and find how many of them are billing AI extract cancellation. And here, I would also see as a downtime request. Now, in order to look at the conversation reports, the active new resolve tickets for your entire team, how long we've been taking to respond, assign, resolve these emails. Now, this is a holistic view of everything like workload report and the performance report by the team. Now, can I simply go ahead and analyze it further? That out of all the resolved ones, how many of them were very much specific to a tag called downtime? So I can go ahead and find out the reporting on the resolved conversations when you want to talk about your team, out of all the four five folks, what are they exactly doing in a specific day or time? Let's say in last 30 days, what have they been so far up to? You could see the emails assigned to these agents in your team versus emails they've already worked upon. Now, if I particularly want to know because I always knew Rakesh does get so many emails that he hasn't been working. This is where you would see how long he has been taking to respond to these emails and out of them, out of these 30 conversations, how many of them has he already worked upon? So this clearly gives me an idea that there's something wrong with this Guy.

EXACT Sports:
  And.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  then you've got reports on slas, like how many of them are the first response violations versus tickets? Where we haven't been able to resolve in time, the first response in time, the resolution in time, the ones which are already violated. Can we find out and understand if these emails were violated with a specific tag called downtime? So, I would know because the system was down, there was nothing much we could do hence the delay of the response. So you would get an option that out of these 27 violated emails, billing requests were the majority of it. And then I can absolutely go ahead and understand what these billing emails are all about.

EXACT Sports:
  Gotcha. Yeah, yeah, that's sort of pretty much tech has told us that or like we've been the ones flagging issues to tech. And right now our system is, we respond and we mark it as unread and I'm like this seems and then it just sits there in the inbox. And then we have, then it looks like we have 70 emails in the inbox, but in reality, we maybe only have 10, but the 60 of them are unread emails that we just sort of have to sit and wait around until 10 can fix it. So, I'm like if there's a better system of flagging them, moving them to different areas or like downtime, that could?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's what I would recommend. We don't have to keep sitting with those emails. We rather move those into the pending section, add a tag onto it, which is a tech escalation. If you want to trigger that and send this email to another inbox apart from directors at the inbox. If there is a tech inbox, we could automatically choose to move these emails to their purview because there's nothing left from our team to work on it, but it's still piling up the work and it's probably a dilemma at the end of the day. Now under the dashboards here, let's say Erin wants to create a dashboard and wants to see how many emails that are coming into the director inbox. And we want to group by status every day on live basis, you would be able to see how many open pending requests, close requests. Do you have at any point in time. Now? She also wants to care about the emails which are coming today, been resolved by the team into the director inbox. Can we find out which representative has been working and resolving these emails? Now, if you notice resolved emails by the different conversations, contact, you'll… be able to run report at these other customer agents who've been working on all of these requests into your inbox. So you can create these dashboards, customize these dashboards absolutely possible. And this gives you a very good way to look at what do we currently deal with? How many emails are floating through? How many of them are open pending closed at any point in time? And all of that is happening from right within the Gmail interface. I would say it is one of those solutions which is plugin and use you don't really require a lot of time to set this up. I've had teams set up on hiver in no more than 15 to 20 minutes, 30 minutes, quick training with the team, and no more than five to seven working days to onboard fully go live in a full swing. So that's how simple the solution is right inside the interface here.

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah. I think we were looking at another brand or another tech solution that it's compatible with Google, but it would be its own complete interface. And I'm like that makes me nervous to like our system. That kind of works. I'm nervous about moving it all over to a system that if it doesn't work, we've completely changed everything that's I don't know as a manager that wouldn't be good to tell my specialists like, okay, we messed up, go back to the old system that was also not great. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And also, you know, what, the biggest advantage with hiver is that your existing Gmail functionalities would remain as it is. We are not changing anything with regards to your directives at the right inbox. The beauty here is that the emails are still routing on your Gmail inbox, which is happening through your servers. Hiver has got no control to it, neither we are reading data. And anything all we are doing is simply helping you manage and sort this email better from within your ecosystem. So you're not erupting anything with regards to your existing setup that remains untouched at all. Gotcha.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, do you see this is a solution that you're looking at? I mean, how confident do you feel about this?

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah, I think this is sort of it checks all the boxes of the big concerns we were having, which was, yeah, like emails, more than one specialist responding to an email at the same time. And then like the inconsistency of multiple, people get very frustrated if it's yeah, if it's you me, John, Mary, like it's they don't like that seven different people are helping them as opposed to one streamlined person as well as, yeah, like there's one of our issues has definitely been like, yeah, multiple people in the inbox. And yeah, they're not being sort of a good way to have a workflow because as they're reading the emails, they have to mark them as unread and then label them. And then I come in and I, you know, we're trying to figure out the best way for the specialists to answer the emails they can answer. And if they can't bump it up the ladder. And right now the system we have isn't good at bumping stuff up the.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Ladder. Absolutely. Yeah, fair enough. And with regards to the trial setup and everything like you said, because at the moment, you don't have individual logins, I think, did I get this right notion that you're open to creating the inbox email addresses for these users?

EXACT Sports:
  Oh, yeah. Yeah. And, we could, I think the reason we have the setup we have now is because it's the easiest, but if it was something where we would you, yeah, even if we just make a few email addresses and, those girls never look in their Gmail inbox because nothing's coming into that address, but it's just a way to feed into hiver that's something, we would look into know.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yep. That's that's what is needed. And other than that, the pricing, you know, looks straightforward or we start with a growth plan, 25 dollars, pro plan is more advanced, which has advanced reporting, advanced analytics, customer satisfaction surveys and all of that. So this is pro, we can always determine which plan works out really well once we go ahead and, you know, set this up as a test environment like we offer a seven day trial where you could test the team, bring in your couple of folks, test the actual emails coming into your director's inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then we can maybe build a case study, for your management to kind of look at it and approve the hiver way of email management versus the traditional way of sharing the passwords. So, yeah, I mean you can always look into which system product plan works well for you. I don't find challenges with this plan unless we require advanced automations and advanced sort of reporting and download those extract and reports. This could still really work for us, which is a.

EXACT Sports:
  and could also be something where, if we're using that and it's not quite right? And, or we love hiver so much. We want to go to the pro plan. Yeah, that's something we could work. I guess a question I would have is, yeah, like testing wise. How would, what's what would you say communication between say if we do a trial or we do sort of like a test and we sort of AB it and, we see like what works? What doesn't it communication wise with hiver? It's would we have an agent? We would have a re, account representative that would sort of work with us, in figuring this out?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I'll be the point of contact. And like I said, I, we will have a complete onboarding support for you from the day one to understand your exact setup to assist you trial, setting up your trial account, invite those users, give them a quick training, and then perhaps seven days of good testing would actually give you a better confidence if this is a good platform. So you won't be let alone by the way. I mean, I'll be there to handhold, and of course, I'll bring one of the, onboarding managers to completely support this evaluation. And only then at the end of the seven or tenth day, we will be able to present this use case internally to the management. But I still wanted to make sure that we are looking at either this or this plan because we don't want to come as a surprise at the end of the day. Hey, that we have, we are not even budgeted for this project. Hence, I wanted to just test based on the pricing. But yeah, I don't find any other support challenge with the support or onboard or even to set it up. We provide exactly the same dedicated support for even trialing our customers.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect. And in terms of, because one of the things we have, is, you, if I send an email, we have send an archive and it's a great way for us to obviously, somebody I've even just yesterday, somebody said, you know, could you look up this email? Did they say X y or Z? And I was able to go in, find that email, get the information for them quickly in terms of like storing data. I don't know if that could count as data, the emails, what would you say hiver does in the sense of if we were to want to go find another email?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's exactly the same way you search. I mean, the search functionality is exactly the same how you use that, on current Gmail. Even if you have your personal emails which are been archived or any of those emails in the director common inbox that you have been archiving, you can simply go ahead and search for the information just the way you search for anything else. So I should be able to go ahead and search anything that I really require. Hiver. Does not, interfere with the existing Gmail workflows or functionalities. It would remain as it is for you. Perfect.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect. Yeah, that's that is good to hear.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Now, can, I know when can we help you set up your trial, maybe test it for the team? And then, help you make a decision and we, maybe, you know, push this internally to your directors?

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah, I think I like the, I like how this, how compatible it is, with Gmail. And it also does seem like if it's not as big, of a point in like getting us from what we're at now to hiver, it would just sort of be readjusting. And, and everything I would say, I'm meeting, I have a meeting today, about this as well as, I have another demo on, I think tomorrow actually.

EXACT Sports:
  So, I think end of week, definitely, I'll I can, reach out, like I said, if you can send me any materials, any, anything to, you know, anything to play with? Any, anything to look at? Anything with bright colors, that I can use. I think definitely, we would want to do a trial of this. Yeah, I think even like a seven, yeah, seven day trial would be perfect to, even if day one and day two are a bit of growing pains. I feel like this is easy enough where we can get, a good system in. So, definitely, by end of week, I'd like to sort of get that rolling.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, no worries. In that case, what I'm going to do is, maybe send you a quick placeholder for about 10 minutes on Friday. You take your time, of course, discuss hiver internally for that. I'm going to be sending you a supporting document also, by tomorrow, I think you're scheduled to catch up with another competitor, which is absolutely fine. You can always tell me later. Who are you going to talk to? Because then I can even be in a good situation to help you with the comparison charts or if you all, if you don't mind me telling, you can even tell me if you're going to be meeting, you know, somebody from the same space, I can even help you with the comparison documents as well. Now, can I go ahead and say about 10, your time we book about for about just 10 minutes meet on Friday and then decide, if we're going to go ahead with a quick testing set up next week onward. And then, yeah.

EXACT Sports:
  Can we actually do, would you be able to do like 10 on Monday?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Let me check that.

EXACT Sports:
  Or 10 or even nine on Monday, whatever works best to.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you, I can do nine on Monday that'll give us sufficient time for you to look at both the solutions and propositions internally. So give me one minute please.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And call it hiver feedback sync. And I'm going to be inviting you. And should there be anybody else who needs to be a participant in the meeting? Maybe if your boss would like to join because they have got first hand questions?

EXACT Sports:
  I'll reach out to him and would I be able to if I, if he has the zoom link, he should be able to join as well?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, I'm giving you the edit access by the way you can edit and invite them also.

EXACT Sports:
  Yeah, I think there, might be two people. It might just be my one manager, but like I said, my one boss, is huge into tech, so he might just come because he loves it so much. So, yeah, I can invite them.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. I've already sent you an invite for nine for on Monday. I mean you might want to check that quickly. And then, we are all good to go.

EXACT Sports:
  Perfect. Yeah. Well, thank you. Thank you so much, for taking the time, to explain this to me. It's it is, it's crazy how you sort of checked all of our boxes, and I think it could be a good, it could be a good tool going forward.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. I'm glad and thank you so very much for your time. I look forward to talking to you again on Monday. In the meanwhile, I'm going to be processing the required meeting today and send you collaterals which are absolutely in line with what we just discussed today. So you could just refer to those helpful resources and discuss hiver internally.

EXACT Sports:
  Amazing.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day. And yeah, thank you so much. I look forward to talking to you again next week.

EXACT Sports:
  Bye. Thank you. Bye.
