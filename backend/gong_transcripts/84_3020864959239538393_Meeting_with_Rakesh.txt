================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  here we go.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yeah. Hi, Rakesh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi. Thank you for joining whenever you're doing so.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Do we have Krunal joining us?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yes. Just wait for one minute. I'm calling to him.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Absolutely. Do you and Krunal work in the same team? Just curious?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Let's just wait until he joins in. Okay, thank you.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yeah, Rakesh Krunal also joining within two minutes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Sure. Absolutely. Okay.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Before he joins, I will give you a little like a short introduction about me and about my company.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Go ahead please.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yeah, yeah. I am the customer care head in the TCL India, and the TCL India is basically the consumer durable company. It's a China based company.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, TCL needs no introduction, sir. Of course, I know.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  About TCL, yes, yes. Yeah. So I'm adding the TCL customer care for the India support the products. And currently, actually, what is our requirement that we have the India on the email business? The, where we are getting the, all the customer query, post sales, right? So we have a channel like one email support where the, all the customer, they are sharing their inquiry through the our like support email. So we are currently using the outlook to manage all those queries through email. So we do not have any, the email management tool. So we are facing currently the issues like every day, we are getting more than 400 emails from the ad users. And currently, we are facing that we are not able to monitor the email volume, that, how many emails we are getting per day? How many emails we are replying? What is the email resolution rate? What is the customer inquiries, resolution rate? What is the response time? And the, in that email process, the around 10, the agents, they are working on that. So, I mean, same time the 10 agents are working and they are replying to the customer query. So, we are not able to monitor the, even our team like performance and we do not have any, the dashboard where we can see all the email process KPIs. So we are looking the email management tool where we can get all the insights and all the monitoring part, and where we can like improve the customer. Like this email channel performance. So that's why we are connected with you any?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Specific reason you require the reporting the KPIs in place because that has not been the case for a long time. I guess you guys have been working in a traditional way manually managing these emails?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yes, yes. Yes. Yeah. Now, gradually, the email volume is increasing. Previously, we were at, we had only the three to four agents who were handling this process. But now the team size is increasing and the volume also is scaling. So once the volume is gradually scaling, we are facing the difficulty to manage it to monitor the, all the entries.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now that you're a team of 10 people, you said earlier, it was just.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Three to four people? Yes, three to four people. Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Any, any reason you haven't had a solution until now? Like even for the three to four people, I'm sure the volume was still enough, right? But did you not think of having to have a tool in place, for the communication management?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Actually, we were not facing the, any like issue previously, we were able to manage it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Even.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Though we do not, we were not able to monitor the performance and dashboard and the response time, but yes, still, we were able to manage all the queries manually, but now it is becoming very difficult to us.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, if I were to, also we.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Are we are also upgrading, the, like the customer case, the systems like in other channels? Also, we have a plan to upgrade the systems where we can see, the transparent, the volume and, the performance. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  But the management also pushing for this part?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So this is a, this is, a project that has come to you guys from your management. So basically, your management wants to go out and look at a solution like this. Yes. Also, I noticed one of my colleagues did speak with Krunal and understood that your team in Australia is already using a tool called helpscout. Yes.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is, do you want to tell me a little bit more about this team in Australia? Like how is it different than the team in India?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Actually, Australia is a different business group actually.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So Australian entity is a different entity altogether? Yes.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yes, it's not like the combined business group. It's a separate business group.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, this project is basically for your India entity, and this has got nothing to do with the Australian entity exactly. I mean, even in terms of making a decision, it has got nothing to do with what Australia entity is working on in order to work for the customer care support part.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Exactly.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Now, since that, they're using help scout, have you not thought of using help scout? Because that's already there bought for the company? Yes.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  So, for help scout, actually, we've seen a demo, but we didn't like that much. It is very user friendly. First of all. But second thing, we required some detailed reporting over.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The tool. Okay. So reporting is the main part.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  Reporting is the main part and user friendliness is another one.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. Okay. Yeah, there.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Was some drawbacks of that tool like the reporting part, and there's some other like features also not available with them. So we are looking at a solution where we can get all these, all the features in the reporting. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. Krunal, if I were to ask you what all different reporting functionalities were missing in help scout? Do you mind telling me what is it that you require and the ones which were missing in help scout? I'll put that in our presentation and I'll help you decide if this is a good tool over the other ones that you're looking at today?

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  Yeah, sure. That is, Vikash will let you know better in a way because I know only the overall kind of a thing. Vikash is the concerned person who is handling total operation of call center over India.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Vikash told me response time resolution time.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yes. In terms of the report, like we are looking the team performance, actually, they have the team performance, but we are not able to extract the data. If we can extract the data, we can see where our team is lacking and we can provide them the coaching and training and the feedback from our quality department. So they have the report on the dashboard also, but we are not able to extract those data.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I see. So basically, you want to download these reports, extract those reports and further do whatever you want to do with those analytics.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Okay, very clear. And apart from that, what timelines we're looking at? I mean, how urgent is this project? Are you more into discovery or?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  No, no. This project is very urgent to us and it depends on the vendors how soon they can provide the solution to us?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I mean, if you look at hiver, it's an easy to use software in no more than one week? I have onboarded teams made them work on hiver with minimal training, very easy to go. But all I'm trying to say is, are you open for testing the tool? If this happens to be a good platform after our discussion, and your management must have asked you.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yes, yes, of course, we will do the testing first. And after that, we will take.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  Care of that. So down the line, you can just keep in mind it is very urgent for us. We will go ahead as soon as we get the demo, and then we will present that with the posting part to the management. We will go ahead in like a very shorter time with the hiver, if it will be get finalized.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So as such, there is no timeline but it's urgent and you want to present it to the management. If this solves your problems. I mean, if it does tick the boxes, you are just readily available to go ahead and discuss it internally with your team. Yes. Okay. All right. What I would love to do is maybe if I could just share my screen and give you a quick product walkthrough and then of course, take all your questions towards the end of the call, if that's okay, sure.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, do you see my inbox here? I'm logged into app hiver, it's a web interface.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  All right. Yes, we can see all.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. All right. Now, here, this is an application running on the web. Once we set up your hiver account, everybody in your team, all 10 people would simply log in into app hiver. They will log in using their existing outlook credentials. So, this is my test credentials from outlook. We don't have to create new accounts for them. The user credentials that they currently use for the outlook is going to be the same to authenticate. Once they log in the top screen here on the conversation will show the personal inbox. Meaning if I send an email to Vikash or Krunal, you personally, you would see those emails in the inbox that's your private emails. These emails are not shared with anybody in the team. And if you notice these shared inboxes, this is going to be a shared inbox for support. For an example, when we set up your care inbox, or your sales inbox, or operations inbox, maybe if you could let me know how many such inboxes do you have for your customer care in India?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  I think it's around four to five, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So imagine all four to five mailboxes are set up here. And then you choose to add right set of people to the right set of inboxes. It could be a possibility that one person, one agent is overlapping multiple departments, but you have the choice to add the right set of people. Now, I'm taking care of the support inbox for today's, demo. Now, if you notice you would have all the brand new requests coming into the unassigned hiver automatically is able to tell you what this client is about. It's a client number one, it's an escalation request is already overdue. It has come on September the seventeenth. Nobody actually replied. It is already an overdue ticket. It is not even assigned to anybody. This all can be done automatically. But I'm just showing you that you have the ability to assign conversations. This is status by default. Email is an open because we need to work on the customer request. And then if it is an escalation ticket, is that a medium escalation? What type of email is this? Is that a warranty refund or is that a complaint? What vendor are we talking about? And then you have the notes here, which is you add, mention your colleagues and you talk to them internally without forwarding emails to each other, or when you're replying to the customers, you have got these email templates and everything. You don't have to keep your entire team in CC if they need to know what's happening, right? So all you do is just the collaboration right here in this panel. And when you assign a conversation to a user agent, you would see the emails in the support team undermine the ones that I need to work as a request. So I have all mine tickets here automatically assigned to me. This is the first response overdue. The SLA is running. These little tags are about the different category of emails. And then from the team section, you want to find out how many total emails are opened up in your post sales support team, which representative is working on, what sort of email. So you have a complete distribution of workload. So you could just say, hey, can I see Yukta in my team is dealing with two emails. And these are the two, if she takes a day off, you have the option to move these emails to somebody else and say, hey, Rakesh. Can you work on these ones? Now, if I go to the Rakesh's dashboard, he has got these six emails. So this number will also update. So I'm now working on these six to seven emails. All in all… any questions by far?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  No, no, I have only the question that how this email will auto assign to the particular team members or particular folder?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We'll come to the automation workflows also. And before that, even if you ask me, can I find out how many warranty emails do we have that are opened up? You go ahead, type a tag called warranty. It tells you there's one email response is overdue late email and there is already an agent working on the email. If you want to find out what this email is about, you open the request and under summarize conversation, hiver can help you summarize it, decode the request and tell you this is exactly what must have happened. It could be a case that there are multiple chain of threads. Now, in that case, hiver can help you summarize the email in one quick second. Now, how many refund requests?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  In this AI, also, the AI will suggest the email reply responses.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, absolutely. Even for the replies, when I'm actually into the admin panel, I have the co pilot here, ask AI will help me draft the responses and these responses can be drafted using the actual knowledge source. So when I go into the hiver AI and I go to the knowledge sources, this is where I can upload my cancellation policy. I can just upload the documents. I can connect with the notion. So whatever knowledge sources you have, whatever the cancellation refund policies that you have got, hiver, can rely on these sources of information, help your agent draft the responses from the ask AI. Okay. Yeah. All right now, apart from that, when I go to the tags and I ask you, hey, these are the number of refund requests that I've got. I can just search for these four email requests that are refund requests right here, right? So no more actually talking to the team, understanding what emails are there, and who is working. You just simply search for a tag and it literally helps you figure out where do we stand in terms of managing these emails? Now, when you asked for, how can we allocate emails automatically? That's where I go into the admin console? And if you look at the auto assignment, all I do is just simply turn this on. And this literally helps me allocate the emails in a fashion that the first email goes to the first person who is online, second goes to the second person as per the availability. And apart from that, let's say, if Krunal happens to be the manager, you can just simply say manager does not need to get these emails assigned because I'm just going to be overlooking all of that. But apart from it, you have the rules on automation workflows. And this could be something like, hey, because we receive all of these emails from a very specific manufacturer. For an example, we talk with abc limited, or we talk with hiver. Any email coming from these domains, the email should get assigned to rekash, no matter what. So that's how you can even go ahead and do the automation workflows even on the basis of subject, if it contains anything to do with the warranty or if it is refund request, then you go ahead and say assign it to a specific agent like you assign it to Siddhant, or you assign it to somebody else in your team. So that's also possible like you're automatically routed. Not only that, but you can always say, because these are the warranty emails. Can I just simply add a tag to these emails? Because we want to label these emails as escalation, somebody asking for the refunds. I could do all of that. The content of the body of the email says anything to do with like, however you receive emails like, okay, I want to cancel what's your shipping policy. Can I just change the address? All of that can be automatically assigned add tags. And even in case you want to send notifications or send replies to the customers, you can automatically do all of that. All right. Is this in line with what you're looking at guys?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yes, yes. And I have one more query here. So this system will also create the ticket for each emails. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So by default, yeah, by default, when you're looking at the conversations, these are actually the tickets only. So a lot of people call it conversations, we call it emails, but these are tickets only because when you're looking at any of those, this is a functionality of a classic ticketing system, right? I mean, you have the ownership, you have the statuses, then you have these custom fields. Then on top of it, you can save the draft with people. You have the email templates for all of those repetitive nature of queries, where you want to just simply use the templates for the team and then customer satisfaction. If you want to ask your customers how happy they are with the level of support. So all of the functionalities are a ticketing functionality. We just don't call ourselves like a traditional ticketing system. Ours is more of a modern way of solving customer problems. So this is exactly the ticketing.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  I mean, in this system, is there any ticket number also where we can see the?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood ticket number to refer to? Yes. Okay. That is in progress. We are building that up. It is already out for our Gmail. I mean, if you notice my Gmail interface, we pretty much do exactly the same for our Gmail customers as well. But for the Gmail, if you look at this, let me just quickly share an example. Okay. Let me just go to my support inbox. And I pull up this email. Now, if somebody asks me what is the ticket number for this? I have the option to just quickly create a ticket number from here itself, right? I mean, if you notice this conversation id is the ticket number? Or when I'm replying to the, customer asks me, okay, what's the ticket number? I have the option here to do the conversation id, which is a ticket number. This is exactly how it would actually look for your outlook part as well. So you will have a ticket number option right here at the bottom which we are already working on.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Okay. So you have that, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We will have it. Yes, we will have it launched very soon. It's already in the beta testing phase. Yes. Okay. All right. Apart from that, if we move forward towards the analytics, so all you do is just go to the reporting part here in the analytics screen. And from here, you will be able to see exactly what you're looking at, right? I mean, how many emails you received today? What's the team performance? You select the shared inbox, first of all, let's say, I'm looking at the support team and I'm looking at the data for last 30 days and I have a complete analytics on the workload. How many active new result conversations do we have as a team? What is the team performance? First response time? How long we assign two emails to each other, response and resolution time for all the tickets by all our agents. So this is like a holistic view of everything that's happening on conversations as well as your performance. But when you dig deeper, one step and you want to find out what your users are doing. That's where you see emails assigned versus emails sent out of these users inboxes, and you want to find out what Rakesh is up to in last 30 days, you see he got 10 emails, only worked upon three. This is his average response time, customer satisfaction. All of that is possible. Now, if you also want to understand, hey, can I get what category of emails we received today? That's where you get to see the reports on tagging, like the escalations, cancellations, refunds, new customers onboardings, right? All of those warranty problems. So you could just go ahead and see all of those right here as well. Slas, on what are the first response violations? How long have we been taking to resolve these emails? Are we violating the resolutions? What is the first response compliance? The resolution compliance? All of that is possible. Like wherever we are able to not respond to those emails in time, it will tell you all of those emails right here and you can further group it by SLA policy or the tags and everything. Now, the reporting on customer satisfaction is how happy your customers are with the level of support you're doing so, you could get to see the reports on the customer satisfaction. Now, this is a dummy account for my test which is why you don't see that any of those. But in real scenario, you would see your customer sending okay, not satisfied. Happy. And then feedback also by individual users who have been working on your tickets. You could just see all of that and ask AI would be more or less on, you know, automatic responses by the hiver. AI, and then to what extent you are able to retrieve the conversation reviewed. And then all of that. Now, this is what I believe was missing in your hubscout. You mentioned see in hiver, you can filter the conversation. You can run the reports. You can search for it as to what you want. And then you can export it and exports can happen in CSV?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Are you with me, guys?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yes, yes. Yes. So all the reporting is also based on the team wise. What is the team performance?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can. I mean if you're just looking at the team performance, you can just simply see any emails assigned to the multiple team members, the status. However, I mean, you want to just look at open pending and resolved emails, you can just simply say, can I get the reporting? So for that, you can just customize the reporting for yourself, the ones which are resolved, conversations assigned to anybody in your team and has a specific tag? Or maybe I mean, it totally depends upon what sort of customizations you want. So you can just simply go ahead and, you know, do it team wise. So this is a support team. This is your operations team. Similarly for operations team, you can customize the report and run it or maybe, you know, export the new reports. You can do that. So, yes. Okay. Any further questions? Is this in line with what you're looking at from reporting from email management, conversation, assigning of emails to each other, tagging each other, automations on, you know, responding to those emails automatically tag? Is this in line Vikash, or are you looking at something else?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yes, from this presentation, yes, I can see that. But for the more deeper side, I need some demo accounts where we can see all these features along with the team, the.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Real scenarios where you could just invite your teammates and we help you set up your account on test and you test it with your real scenarios, right?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Okay. So real scenario also, we can test, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can set up your care at the rate or support at the rate TCL. And then we can help you test all of those in your real time. Like your customers sending emails, you invite your teammates, and they reply to hiver, you know, to these customers on hiver, so that you can literally test as to how hiver is going to be working on your real customer use cases. That is absolutely possible.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Okay. So can you create the demo account for us? So we can also test that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. For that, you give me some time, let me know when are you available and I want to bring one of my onboarding managers to assist you with the setup. So we don't have to just create it and give it to you. We would rather bring you on to the call, understand the different use cases and how different mailboxes you want to create in hiver. We'll help you set it up, invite your teammates, and then do a training for your team. And then you use the solution. So let me know when do you want to set it up? And I'll bring my onboarding manager to help you with the setup. Are you available tomorrow?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Let.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  me, check my calendar. Give me one second. What time are we looking at tomorrow, sir?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  You are in India?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, I'm located in India. My onboarding manager is also looking at the India standard times. Maybe we can do at five P. M, if that's okay. No.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  It's not, it's at three and four, okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Three or four. I've got a meeting at three three 30, but I can do slightly. Let me just check. Okay, two 30. Okay. How about two 30? Can we set it up at two 30 or 245? If that's okay?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  245? Yes, 245 is okay. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All I do is do need is like time for about, I mean.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  But I just want to remind one thing initially, we will not integrate the whole customer like support email with your system, but maybe you can create just demo account to us and we will check the internally, all the functions in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That case, I would require Krunal to maybe just create a dummy inbox, like maybe a group inbox? In outlook and then we test hiver onto it.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Okay. No worries. Or you can even take my email address?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Also… you can, but then do you receive emails into your inbox? Like, I mean, that's a personal inbox, right? It still does not make any difference but for.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  A demo use, I need to create one email id, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. It could be a group inbox. Also, you don't have to create it like a proper password related one. I mean, you could just simply say it's a group inbox, and we can send a couple of test emails to that group inbox and you test it, but is there any reason you don't want to test it for your real scenario? Like a customer email inbox?

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  So, basically, we have one email id for customer inbox currently in India. Okay? And that id have received a lot of requests on that, and we are working live on that same thing. Okay? But,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  you said you have got three to four inboxes?

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  Yeah, that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  three to four inboxes is like we have created a rule in a one mail id only, that is only a, you can say a folder. Okay? That is not a separate mail id? Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  So, you,

Vikash Lekhwar:
  just check that. If you can provide any like dummy email account?

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  No, without our dummy email, I think they can't give you the demo, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I mean, we assist customers to set up hiver.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  And package, yeah. Is this possible? If we will provide?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You an email?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Is this possible? If we will provide you any email?

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  Email account will work?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, I think Vikash is saying something. Go ahead. Vikash.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  Gmail account is, Gmail account is work. Yes, we.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  will provide any Gmail account?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, but then I am not sure how would you make a decision on outlook? Because your ecosystem is on outlook? I mean, Gmail has a different, I mean, of course, the functionalities are similar, but then you, it will be like I am looking at a denim, but I am buying a.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  Coat, right? Rakesh, one thing when you required the id tomorrow.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You take your time. You let me know if you?

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  No, no, no. If we, if we suppose we schedule a meeting by tomorrow 245, you required id?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Tomorrow, then we have to have a account. Yes. Okay.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  You will get it. I'll share out of share of it. I'll you will get it out there.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then I will say we do the hiver test account setup. And I am sending you both an invite tomorrow. Okay? All right. Right. I don't have your email, Vikash, do you want to just send your email on to the chat? Please? Okay. On zoom chat, and I'll invite you as well, along with, Krunal, just make sure that your company does not have any restriction on setting up hiver, like any third party tool that's just one thing or otherwise, if you are setting up a new account, like dummy test account at TCL, or maybe, you know, hiver test at TCL, you can just simply create a group account like outlook group inbox, that.

Krunal Solanki (krunal.s@tcl.com):
  Should also do. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then I'm bringing one of my onboarding managers sending you an invite for 245 tomorrow. Let's connect guys. Should there be any change or you require any further assistance, just simply feel free to write back to me and we'll otherwise connect tomorrow. May I know?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Why do you require the group account? Actually? Great. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The reason is with group inbox, you would realize that this is going to be a common inbox for the number of people. Now, if you even want to add other folks into the group inbox for testing, you could see this is exact replica of your support inbox. Right? Like instead your customer sending an email to hiver demo at the rate TCL, they're just simply sending emails or you're getting tickets at care or support at the rate TCL, may I know what is that? TCL's common inbox email address?

Vikash Lekhwar:
  It's a India support email. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, it's basically the same, right? India support at TCL instead of we would just test it on hiver demo account at TCL, but the difference would be zero. You can even invite your customer support representatives into hiver demo test and they can see emails been assigned to each other, respond to those emails, use certain workflow automations. You could run reports as well, tag those emails. But if that is connected to one of your personal email inboxes, then number one, you're sharing your personal inbox with the team. Maybe you would hesitate, you would be hesitant to invite the team also to work on those personal emails.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So that's why the best is to have a demo account running on a shared email inbox. Okay. All right. There is an invite already sent out to you. Please accept it whenever you have a moment and we will reconnect tomorrow.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Okay. Rakesh. Yeah. All right. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. Thank you so much for your time again and look forward to talking to you. We'll help you set up your account and we'll take it up from there.

Vikash Lekhwar:
  Yeah, thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You take care. Goodbye, bye.
