Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  I'm so sorry, I'm late.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. I'm.

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  having some technical difficulties.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No problem at all. How are you doing now?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  I'm doing well. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'm doing okay. Thank you for asking. Shall we get started with the discussion?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. And so in regards to our previous conversation wherein we did explore how hiver could be the tool that you could implement for your workflow. We also had certain discussions in regards to how you could achieve the search panel or sort that or make it a lot easier than how you're doing it today. So I did share the workflow for that as well. Did you get a chance to look at those collaterals that I shared with you? Any feedback? I did. Okay, great. Any feedback on that? Like did you get a chance to discuss this internally?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Yeah. So I've had an opportunity to obviously, you know, being full transparent, fully transparent, you know, we've been trying to vet different companies to see what product is going to work for us. So I have had an opportunity to provide, you… know, some information on all of the vendors with my executive leadership team.

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  And so they are in the process of vetting all the options. The only thing that I would ask, is the pricing on your website, the pricing we should go by?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I mean, it depends on, you know, how many users we are looking at as well as the number of shared mailbox. Of course, the pricing that you see on the website is the standard price, but we can be flexible depending on your budget and other things as well that I mentioned? So there could be a scope of negotiation or like, you know, having customized pricing for you, so we can do that?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Yeah. So what I would ask is if you, so if I give you the amount of people, would you be able to give me a quote? Because I do have another meeting here in the next couple of weeks with my executive leadership team to talk pricing and kind of have hopefully some sort of final decision on where we want to go with this, but I will need a quote if you can provide that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I could help you with that. I just want to make sure because to go to my deal desk team and then, you know, get the quote that I could share with you, of course, that will come with its own validity. And usually that happens at the advanced stages of, you know, the discussion wherein there is nothing else left in terms of the evaluation. So, is pricing the only factor that you're considering at this point in order to make the final decision?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Yeah, pricing is where we're at with some of this stuff, right? Like I think, you know, your resolution for the archiving and the searching is mostly in line with some of the other stuff that we were looking at. So at the end of the day, unfortunately, I'm not the final decision maker and I have to present to my executive leadership team and right? Obviously they won't make a final decision until pricing is involved.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Understood. And how many like we discussed the pro plan last time with five shared mailboxes that you were looking for? Is that the same for now? Or would you be starting with less mailboxes and with any specific number of users?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  So it would be 16 users to start. Okay, and let me get you a count for customers. Give me one moment.

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  And it would be about 30 mailboxes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  30 mailboxes. Okay. Let me share my screen with you. Let's go through the pricing. So these are the plans that we have. Each plan will have its own set of shared mailboxes that you can create. If you're looking at 30, that would come in the elite plan because pro has a limit to create five at max. And then with elite, everything gets unlimited. You'll be at the highest tiered plan that we have. So this is the plan that we look at about 75 dollars per user per month. So if we are looking at 15, so we said in bucket of five, and so it would be the 510, 15, 20 users. So if you're looking between 15 to 20, then we'll be looking at 20. Okay, if it's under 15, then we can look at 15. So you mentioned there would be 16 to 17 users in total. Is it?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  That's correct?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So we'll be looking at total 20 licenses at elite, right? So any budget that you have in mind already, what are the other tools that you're evaluating at this point? Would you mind sharing that?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Yeah. So there are just a lot of other comparable companies that, but your pricing seems to be in line. So, I mean your pricing is doable. So definitely would like to get like a final quote, but so far from the look of it, you know, 75 per user per month under the elite program is actually really great. So that would be within our budget.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And with this, I also want to confirm, would you also be requiring any of the AI functionalities that we went through the other day in terms of the AI co pilot that we have here wherein the agents, can you can upload any of the, anything in the knowledge source and that will help you drafting the response asking any question to AI and auto tagging. And all of that, would you be requiring those functionalities as well or not at this point?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Is that part of the elite package or is that an add on?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's an add on that's why I'm asking. So hiver AI comes as an add on for 20 dollars per user per month. So if you want this as well, then I would share a quote including it, which would be at 95 dollars then per user per month. And then give you what's the price that we could do, or if you think that this is not something that you would want to implement at this point, then we can just stick to the elite without the AI functionalities.

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Yeah. I mean, I still think that it's comparable. So, yeah, I would say let's get a quote with the AI included.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  OK. Got it. Cool. Then I will be sharing the proposal with you with the email and writing. I might not be able to share our official quote at this point because we are still not sure in terms of the timelines and all. And you need to sort of present this internally to your leadership, which I completely understand in order to move forward or probably shortlist this tool as well. So let me do that on email. Will that work for you to give you a fair idea?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Yeah, that's fine.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  OK. And from there, what do you suggest as the next steps in terms of what should we be doing? What would be your next steps from your side?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Yeah. Like I said, I will need to bring some sort of at least pricing idea or quote to my leadership team. That meeting is really not to take place for the next couple of weeks. It being so close to our thanksgiving holiday at that point, we're probably looking at the first week of December before we even meet. And I know that that's an extent of time that I'll be honest with you. My company is very conservative when it comes to these things. So, yeah, I just want to be transparent. So I mean if you could give me some sort of a quote idea of what we would be looking at, that would really help me. And then I can be in touch with you after our meeting in the first week of December.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let's do that. And in terms of the product overall, your own impression in terms of, do you like it as compared to the other tools that you have seen, where do you place hiver at this point in your pool of choices that you currently have?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  I mean, like I said, it's pretty comparable, y'all, pretty much have similar setups in that it's looks like outlook and functions somewhat like outlook but has a CRM type functionality to it as well, which I really like. I'm more of a CRM person like my experience is more with CRMS like Salesforce and C for C. So the fact that all of these products seem to have a CRM type functionality to it, I really like with the ticketing and all that. I mean, it's pretty comparable. So, you know, I think it'll just boil down to right? Like how efficiently it'll really search. And then pricing, of course, right is a factor for everyone. Business is business. But yeah, I mean it's pretty comparable to some of the other tools we're vetting.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. Yeah, that really helps.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Thanks for sharing that. Okay. Then let's do this. Let me share the proposal with you over the email. And is it okay if we just put a placeholder for some time in first week of December or around eleventh or twelfth? Because in the first week, so if either we could connect on either second December or third or we can connect any day after eleventh?

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Yeah. Why don't we put the latter part of that week. So somewhere either Thursday or Friday, the fourth or the fifth?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, fourth or fifth. I won't be available here and so either we then connect on eleventh or twelfth because I'll be back on tenth, so we could connect on eleventh, if that works.

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Yep. Eleventh is great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Then let me share the invite with you and we can be in touch. Let me know what your thoughts are in terms of the proposal and then we can take it forward from there.

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Okay. That sounds perfect. Thank you so much for your time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. And thank you so much. Take care. Bye bye. All.

Ann Rackoff (arackoff@nixonpower.com):
  Right. You too. Bye bye.
