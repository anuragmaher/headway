Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hi angeles. Hello?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Can you hear me okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I cannot hear you, angeles, can you hear me?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. You seem to be on mute. Actually, I mean, do you want to just unmute? Maybe?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  I fixed it hello.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hey, thank you for joining. How are you doing?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  I'm fine and you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well. Thank you so much. Let me quickly introduce. This is the very first time we're catching up. My name is Rakesh and I take care of sales for the european territory. I've been with the company for over four years, personally onboarded more than 500 teams and I'll be your point of contact today to run the show.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Okay. Sorry. Did you ask me a question or something?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, I just simply introduced myself and I wanted to make sure that, hey, we know each other before we begin. And yeah, let me know what made you look at hiver. Tell me a little bit more about yourself, your company, what exactly you're looking to achieve? And I'll make sure to tell if this is a good tool for your needs.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Okay. We are looking for a platform for a very specific, how do we say it? Reason? So I contacted you from credit Fama, where I'm the manager in marketing and the team is less than 10 people. Credit Fama is a company from Uruguay. It works like a fintech, but we do not give loans or any money. The only thing we do is we have this platform online and free that the people from our country register there, so they can see the options they have in the credits. I don't know who are got it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, basically, you do the credit validations and credit card checks and eligibility for what all offers they are eligible for, right?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Yes, it's okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Now, could you tell me what is that very specific need for which you're looking at hiver?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Yes. So now we have, we don't have, I don't know how you say it like attention… for the people for the customers. We don't have that because we are very few people, but we have many people that writes us to our email contact and we cannot answer them because we don't have the resources and we need something with AI that nothing… that can take the task to answer them. Like we don't want to use someone from our team to be reading those emails and answering them because we cannot do that now. And we need something automatized that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Does it? Oh, okay. But you said you have a team of less than 10 people already?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Yes, but we have like half of them is on the it team. Okay? And the other, I mean, we don't have the time to.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So basically, you need a solution that can read the emails automatically and respond to those customer emails without having to have your team intervene. So you don't want your team to log in into a tool, you don't want any human intervention, but a solution or maybe an AI based tool that can read the emails, respond to your customers as soon as possible. You receive those exactly. Okay. All right. Well, I can be very transparent at this point in time. Let me tell you with hiver, we need to have agents log in although we will help my tool. The AI functionality will certainly assist you to maybe, you know, look at those emails, automatically, draft responses to those emails. If these emails are so repetitive and recurring in nature, tool can even answer those, but it cannot just happen without a human intervention. So I would say, let's say, you know, if you receive 80 percent queries, which are, hey, can I check my status? Could you check my credit score? Can you tell me if this is offered? This offer is valid? All of those are queries which are repetitive like you always get it. Like almost every day you receive it, we can, you know, we can triage those emails and respond automatically. But the remainder of emails say around 20 30 percent that needs human intervention. For an example, an irate customer writes to you saying, hey, can I get to speak to your boss? Now that's an escalation? Now that needs to be routed to a human individual in your team. So what our tool would do is we would still need the workforce. We cannot just eliminate the workforce. Are you open for it or are you looking for something which should not have a human workforce at all?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  No, we are open to it. It's more a what's more, we had some experience with ais to do this task and we know that the AI has to learn and understand the messages we receive so that it can answer correctly. Nowadays. We have a base. I don't know if you call it of knowledge because it wouldn't be for the AI, but we have the answers already written. So you only copy and paste them on the emails. They are very repetitive. So it's possible that option. And I know from my experience that I read those emails that very, a lot of them are the same that you can answer extremely easily and, but also many of them has to be written for a person like AI can't answer them. And also, I don't know the customer asks for something that we have to modify on their profile. So that has to be manual.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, absolutely. And that's doable with hiver. Now, can I know how many total users would be using hiver?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Not more than three.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. No more than three. Now, we do a bucket licensing. We do either two user licenses or we go for a five user licenses. So for three user, we have to go for a five like a bucket tier of five. Are you open for discussion on all of those?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  I think now our idea is to spend the less money possible. So we can see if it works for us. So we can cut that users to two. No.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Worries. Yeah, absolutely. All right. And what timelines are you looking at? Like, is that an urgent project for you? Are you more into discovery that, hey, I'm just into market to see what all tools and applications are available. So, how urgent is this for you? What are the timelines?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  I mean, we are now looking for the options on the market. It's not the only call I have today but I just want to understand if these platforms because I never used them before are able to do what we want. And I see this can. So I just going to have the other calls and take the decision. So I don't know next week or the other, we can start using it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Are you going to be the decision maker or somebody else in your team along with you?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  I am.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Do you mind if I share my screen quickly, give you a walkthrough on how hiver functions?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Of course, all.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. And just one last thing, do you host emails on Microsoft outlook or Google workspace? Gmail?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Google space?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Then I'll show you a product that simply works on top of Gmail, so that you have better clarity on how we support this use case. And there is a, I mean, just wanted to get one more clarity. I mean, you said there is one common inbox where you receive customer queries today, like something like support at the rate or some emails?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Yes, exactly. There is.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Now, if you notice I am simply logged in into my Gmail account, this is my hiver test account, and I have a Chrome extension. So all the two users who would work on these emails, you know, maybe the automatic assignments and everything, automatic responses on these emails. They simply need to log in into their Gmail have hiver extension running on the top and they would see anything yellow on top of Gmail is hiver on the top inbox. This is the private emails, like I receive emails in my inbox, and you have your personal emails in the inbox not shared with the team. But we would create an inbox for you. Just like you see these multiple trays here. Like, so these are the different shared email inboxes, something like support at the rate inbox would be your email account, where we will connect it to your common inbox, and you will have all the brand new requests in the unassigned which are not been answered by hiver AI, or by your agents. But when agents receive emails to their, you know, bucket, you see that in the mind section. So hiver will tell you if this is a neutral customer. If this is an angry sad customer, queries about a feedback or billing, if the email is already delayed response, then on basis of it, you could see what this email is about. Hiver agent can literally summarize the conversation and it can help your agents draft a response on the base of the knowledge base. Like you said right now, let's say customer is asking for a pricing now, even on basis of the email, I could even say this is a pricing query. All right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And if it is a pricing query, I mean, all hiver would do is just simply pull the information from the knowledge base. And if I were to show you the knowledge base going into the copilot, I can host all my documents here so I can upload the knowledge base for the repetitive queries. And then I can even turn on the hiver knowledge base. And you can use this, both of these platforms. And on basis of it, your agents should be able to respond to these chats, emails, draft responses. And also when you reply, you have the repetitive queries. Also like every time somebody respond to you with a question on refund, you have templates also.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Okay. That's great. So, so on the repetitive emails, you have to do that manually, but AI is able to do that or is that correct?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Correct. And also whenever you receive emails, hiver can automatically look at the actual context of the email, learn to say this is a refund email. So it tags the email refund for you. Okay. All right now, let's say when I'm replying and I'm doing a test reply, let's say even if your agent is automatically typing all of that through hiver, AI, responding back, sending an email, closing it, meaning you're just resolving the query and all the closed emails will move to the closed bucket. Apart from that, how many total tickets are assigned to the different agents? You would have these two agents and they would have their sort of tickets opened up. And this is helpful when I know my colleague Aditya is on a day off. So I know these are the ticket requests. Two of them are important. Three of them are extremely important. So I would say, okay, let me work on this one. And then I just reassign it to me so that's how I have a complete visibility as well.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Okay. So the integration is entirely on Gmail. It doesn't use a platform aside or a panel on hiver or something like that. It's all on Google is.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That like a concern, like do you want a tool which can be more of a web interface and not Gmail?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  No, I just want to understand it. We.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Offer both the solutions by the way, a lot of our customers love it right inside Gmail because they're a small team and they don't want to maybe, you know, learn a new system or go log in somewhere else. But if you want, there is another interface which is app hiver, which again is a very simple to use system where people would log in using their emails, the Gmail email credentials available for themselves for the tickets, personal emails on the top and support email inbox right here. Mind tickets. All of these are the ones which are customer tickets, open the ticket, look at what the ticket is assigned to, what the status is, whatever the tag of the ticket is, meaning, it is a refund email. And then hiver automatically tag this email for you. And then from here, you add mention, drop each other, the notes, talk to your teammates and all of that. And it also lets you do the same through the copilot draft, the responses, summarize the conversation. All of that is pretty much possible. So this is exactly the same, but it is running on app, hiver, a web interface. Whereas this is more inside the Gmail interface.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  OK. Now, inside the Gmail interface, it's OK, I have a question there. If we choose this option, would we be able to have like a first guide call or something like that teach us to use this platform?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, yes. Absolutely. If you, if you look at the help center here, this is a knowledge based guide that we offer to our customers. And again, you could go to get started. It has exact step by step on how to set up on Gmail. Setting up the complete, you know, onboarding guide. Whatever the requirement is, you install the hiver, everything is pretty much possible with exact step by step guide. And on top of it, if you require help with the onboarding, you can start with our support chart as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Our engineers are available 24 or seven. So you can even ask for any assistance as well so that we can get you set up your account and get started.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  OK. That's great. And could we talk about prices? I see, I saw, the well, I think it's under the 100 dollars.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, if you look at the co pilot, the one for the AI drafts, the AI agents, I don't think you have to look at this plan. This is actually a plan which is extremely important for bigger teams and teams that require, you know, more of a skill based or hipaa compliance for medical companies, Okta, integration. So I don't think you require this one. This plan should still suffice your needs. The pro plan to begin with. That could do the AI agent of writing emails, triaging emails, co pilot to draft automatic responses. It also integrates with your surveys, SLA replies to the customer workload. So this should do for you. And even if you say we want to just start small, we just simply need the, you know, growth plan without AI, even just the little bit of composition or summarization of emails. You can even look at this one as well. But this gives you the AI drafts and everything.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Okay. And this can be bought for a month. And if we, I don't know if I understand it does work for us, we can shut it down.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. If it works well, then you can go for annual, but you can also try month on month.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Yes. Okay. So it's very clear for me. I don't have any other questions. I really liked it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. And should you want to start with hiver, just let me know. I can even assist you with the setup or even if you require, you know, any sort of discount, maybe, you know, I can do annual cost for monthly as well for you. Maybe, you know, you want to try it for a month or two. I can still make it 65 dollars for you. So that you are just startup, you're looking at you're a small team, you're not spending 85 per login. So maybe you can just spend 65 into two on month also. So I will make that happen for about 20 percent discount for you.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Okay. That's great for us. I, thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Any more questions at this point in time?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  I don't think I have a, so it's able to answer emails with AI without supervision and it's able to categorize the emails and generate.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  responses, draft responses. The emails which are repetitive in nature can be triggered on the workflow to automatically send emails like, hey, what's your cancellation policy? So this answer is absolutely same. So hiver will read the email. AI will triage saying this is a cancellation policy. And on cancellation, we can trigger a template for you.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Okay, perfect. And it's everything, last question, everything is in English or does it have the option in Spanish? Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, the tagging can happen in Spanish. The notes comments, the templates, the email responses can also go in Spanish because we are ultimately going to be using the Spanish keyboard, so that's not a problem. We can even respond and templatize those emails in Spanish.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Oh, great. That's great. Lovely. Okay. What?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Are the timelines we're looking at?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Wow. Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is there, is there a timeline like what timelines are we looking at to make a decision?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  So, this week, I'll be seeing other prices and platforms. Okay? And I think on Wednesday, I can have all that information and take the decision so we can put.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Our, maybe I can give you a call on next Wednesday.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Okay. Yes, of.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Course. Can I get your phone number so that I could give you a quick call?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Yes, you have to use the original code that is five nine, eight, nine, five, three… five, two… one eight.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me quickly check that on zoom with you that I have the right phone number. Is this the good one?

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Yes, that's the right code that's the right number.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, plus nine five nine eight is the country code.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  It is exactly.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And where are you located? I'm just curious.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  In Uruguay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, you're in Uruguay. Okay. All right. Lovely. All right. Thank you for your time and I will connect with you on Wednesday next week and I will send you the recording of our meeting so that you can make a decision. If there are any more questions, you can write back to me on the same email. We'll be more than happy to take all your questions.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Okay, perfect. Thank you for your time.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You're welcome. You. Take care. Goodbye.

Angeles Eiris (angeles.eiris@credifama.com):
  Take care bye.
