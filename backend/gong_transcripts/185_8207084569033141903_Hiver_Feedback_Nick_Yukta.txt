Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Nick. How are you?

Nick M:
  Hi, Yukta. Well, thank you and yourself.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you. How has it been going in terms of the trial? The testing? All good?

Nick M:
  Yeah, it's been fine from what I gather, we just are adjusting to the new chat system. It's a little different to what we were using. So, I've been traveling as, you know, this week. So I haven't had a good opportunity to keep an eye on things closely, but I have just set up the woocommerce integration right before our call, and I've done an initial test right now and I'm actually not seeing the… order information. I'll share my screen with you to.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Begin with, yeah, I'll just help you.

Nick M:
  Okay. Can you see my screen here?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can.

Nick M:
  So, in this case, as you can see under the apps, the customer email is not found.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes. Is it there in the woocommerce under this email address? No way.

Nick M:
  I don't use zoom often. I don't know how to, ah… the top bar. I need to shrink it to go to the next tab.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can, yeah, you have to, also, can you share your entire screen? Because if you're comfortable sharing the woocommerce page as well, so that I can see?

Nick M:
  That's exactly what I'm going to do. So, can you see now my?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Woocommerce? Yeah. Now, I can see, yes, yes.

Nick M:
  Okay. So if you see here this email address?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Nick M:
  It's from an existing order that we have. Now, if we go back to?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It doesn't show you the order details. Okay? Can you click on the email address info there? Like on that little?

Nick M:
  Pardon, which one?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Where you see all the email addresses like to, from the details, ah, yes. Yeah. Can you click on that? So it's coming from this email address to support. And when did you, when did you do the setup of woocommerce? Ah.

Nick M:
  Right now, so I've done the setup. That is, that might be the reason. So the setup.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Was, yeah, that would be, yeah, yeah, yeah, because it really takes some time.

Nick M:
  Right. But because when it's looking now, it just says, no customer found, I'll keep an eye on it for new orders if you think that's what it is for new emails, can?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You try refreshing this page once and see if it's working, sure because it will work. Eventually. There should not be a problem as long as there is a history or details in the platform. It could be because it's just syncing and taking some time. Okay? Can you go to the details apps? Okay? For email?

Nick M:
  So, it is searching for the correct email?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Can you check for any other lead? Any other email with any other email address?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let me get someone from the.

Nick M:
  Okay. This is a contact form, so that's not.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It has to be coming from a customer email address, sure. And then it should show you.

Nick M:
  Ah, this one seems to be working actually.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It is right. This is also Gmail. Com. So this is fine. This is also coming from this customer. Maybe give it some time. Maybe it could be a one off case. It might take some time to reload and show you the complete data there, but I'm sure it will come up as long as you have that in your application. Sure. Yeah, if it doesn't.

Nick M:
  so, if I click this, let me just, does that actually open the order record? Does it?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let's see. I don't think so.

Nick M:
  Yeah. Okay. Good. All right. Casey, Cleland. Yeah, that's correct. All right. So that is actually working. All right. It would be better if we could see products here, but that's okay. At least it opens the order record that's useful.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can open the record. Yeah.

Nick M:
  Yeah, that's fine. All right. Well, it is working in this case, so I'll keep an eye on it. The only thing I haven't set up is the phone yet because I'm traveling this week. I won't have a chance till next week, but the trial is ending. I have got my team using the system.

Nick M:
  So I'd like to proceed and purchase the license now or today, but on a monthly basis, please, without a contract?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's fine. Can you click on the hiver icon and click on upgrade, we can look at different plans that we had. So for the monthly, can you click on the monthly button? So monthly?

Nick M:
  We.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  are looking at the growth plan, right? To begin with? Yeah.

Nick M:
  What's the difference here between the pro?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I mean, there are differences for the functionality. Pro has a chatbot it has, which you don't want, right? It has csat and all of those things. But I think based on the conversation that I've been having growth will suffice, your need. It has woocommerce, it has live chat. It has certain automations that you can set and other stuff as well. So, I think you can start with growth plan for three users. You're looking, right? So, since we sell in bucket of five, so it'll be for five users? Okay?

Nick M:
  Oh, I see. So you don't sell per user? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it starts at minimum two. Yeah, right.

Nick M:
  I see, can I get to, does that include administrator?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Like myself? Yeah, everyone, of course.

Nick M:
  Because I don't actually do any customer service. So we have to get five.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Nick M:
  Okay. All right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So that'll cost you 175 dollars per user, so.

Nick M:
  You mean for all users, 175?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, yeah. Sorry, for months? Yeah, yes. Okay.

Nick M:
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Does that work for you?

Nick M:
  Yeah. I mean, it's okay. As long as it provides sufficient value for my business. To be honest, I haven't had enough time to, like I said, just test your chat system, et cetera. If it works fine with the existing workflows with my chat as… compared to the old system.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Nick M:
  Because the organizational email system's fine. That's we don't have a problem with that. It's really just the chat and I haven't had a chance to test the telephone yet, as mentioned, but I mean, this is on a monthly basis, right? So we can cancel if it doesn't work for any reason.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's not contract you can, and I hope that you don't have to cancel. It should work smoothly for you. But yeah, for now, you could go ahead with monthly because of course, going annual is more, you… know, you'll get a 20 percent off straight. So you can then next month decide if you want to, you know, implement that.

Nick M:
  Yeah, it's going to be several months.

Nick M:
  I want to test workflows first. And then I can decide on annual, all right. So I can proceed now. So if I click buy now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you just have to put in the details and it'll be upgraded.

Nick M:
  Okay. All right. Is it card payment?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. It's going to be taking credit card details, yes.

Nick M:
  Right. Okay. All right. So I'll do that at the close of our call then, and yeah, see how that goes. And if I need additional assistance from yourself or, from hiver, do I reach out to you or how do we do this?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can reach out to me. You can also connect with the hiver support team as they are available 24 seven. So, like I've mentioned, you click on the hiver icon. From there, you can just start the chat right away if you want. I can offer you an onboarding call wherein you can invite your team members.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  If you are out, they can just join in this week and I can give them sort of a overview of how they can use hiver so that they don't find any difficulty. Do you want me to schedule that?

Nick M:
  Yes, please.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. When do you want me to do this?

Nick M:
  You know what? Let's do it next week? Okay? Because then, I'm back home and I can join effectively and we can collaborate. So I'm on the same page.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let's do that next week when, or should we do it on Tuesday around the same time? No?

Nick M:
  Not Tuesday. No, I'm getting off a 20 hour flight. So, let's see.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Not Tuesday. Sure then.

Nick M:
  Let's let's say later in the week would be ideal. I would say.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  How about Thursday then? Because Friday, I'll be off next week. Yeah.

Nick M:
  Okay. Thursday and I'm on Cyprus time zone. I can't remember what time we collaborated or met up last time when I was in Cyprus, but around that same time. So, after lunchtime Cyprus time or somewhere there is usually ideal.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. I.

Nick M:
  think it's GMT plus two at this time morning time. Okay? Last.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We connected it. So on Friday we connected the same time works for you. Is it? Yeah.

Nick M:
  Yeah, I believe. So. Yeah, what time that?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Was four PM ist?

Nick M:
  Four PM istc is time in Cyprus, is it plus GMT plus two?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Nick M:
  Okay. Let's do that. I'll just double check my calendar.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And you can invite the other team members as well?

Nick M:
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. You're in Cyprus? It says Singapore for some reason. Okay?

Nick M:
  Yeah, my company's in Singapore.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. Makes sense. Got it. Cool.

Nick M:
  Yeah. So I've got, so… I'm in a different time zone. So all my appointments are a bit on this time zone. So it's a bit confusing, but I think the afternoon is free. I,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  think there'll be 12 30 for you on Thursday next week. Does that work? 12 30?

Nick M:
  12 30 Cyprus lunchtime? Yeah, that's.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  going to be fine. Okay. Let me share the invite then. And in the meantime, you can complete the payment so that your account is transferred. And then I'll take any questions and help you with the onboarding next week.

Nick M:
  All right, perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  All right. Anything else that I could help you with and let me know about that lead that you were not getting the details on. If you still don't get it, just let me know so that I can get it checked.

Nick M:
  I'll have the team work, you know, on through their workflow, day to day, monitor it and let me know if it continues.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Sounds good.

Nick M:
  All right. Thank you. Yukta, we'll speak next week then, bye.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
