Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Asaph.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Hey, Cole. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  How's your day so far?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It's good. It's been like crazy. It's been back to back all day, but always a good thing.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Definitely, sorry to keep you busy.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, no, of course. It's only, you know, only two, 245 here on the east coast. So it's not too late.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Where are you based at?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  New York City?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay. Same, same, where in the city are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm in park slope Brooklyn.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay. I'm right next to Columbus circle.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, nice. I love that area.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  It's a very old people area, but it's nice.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Can't beat central park?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Definitely.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I appreciate, you know, you hopping on the call here today.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So just to set a quick agenda, would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role, what got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Yeah, for sure. So, just a very brief introduction about myself and the company. So, I'm one of the founders and the CEO of, parter is a database and data AI company for hardware manufacturing. We basically help with observability for any risk for supply chain and procurement and compliance. We are in the process of evaluating software solutions and specifically for support currently have like our own automations based on notion. And we were thinking about moving to intercom. But then hiver popped up and linked into me to be honest, I wasn't really familiar with you guys up until a few days ago, and we are looking like for a support that includes like ticketing and chat and really covering all emails from our customers. Something that would be very easy to implement. We have like dozens of customers and hundreds of different users. Most of them are based in the us and in Europe. Yeah. And that's about it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, and is it primarily email support that you're looking to provide today? What are the channels that you're gonna offer or you're offering to your clients?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  No, so definitely, not just email. We have like two ways. The first one is from email and then we have like automation that goes from email to notion and then to our own internal tool, but we also have like through the platform so users can open tickets today, and we want to have the ability to chat with them on our interface at real time.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And are people reaching out to that info at parter, AI email? Is that the primary email where people are writing in support?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  No, we have like we have a different email address?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many total are you managing within the organization?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  How many, what I'm sorry?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Emails?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Say, like up to… active users that like need support. I would say like north to a 1,000 users.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So I can hop into a product demonstration here, give you a rundown of hiver, how we can help you better manage, you know, your email support queries. But just to understand further as well, are you using Gmail or outlook today?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Gmail.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You're using Gmail? Okay, cool. So let me just share my screen… and we'll just hop into this demonstration… and how many people are the business today? Asaph, and I'm saying that correctly, right? Asaph.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Yeah. Okay. About say, 20.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  20 people at the company total? Okay. So let me share my screen here. And, okay, perfect. So, what's nice about hiver and a key differentiator from other support tools off the bat is that we are native to Gmail. So we're a certified Google partner and you can log into Gmail with your normal company login. And then you'll have access to hiver as a solution. And hiver has, you know, a couple different ways that we can engage with clients and manage communications. We have email management, chat management, whatsapp, voice knowledge base, and a customer portal. So, these are the different ways that we can engage. And then this is the admin panel where we're going to set up our integrations, our AI capabilities, and other parts of the platform.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But going back to the front end, so on the left hand side, you're going to see a couple different things. You're going to see these shared inboxes. So, customer success, mailbox, a finance share, mailbox, healthcare, info, operations, support. And then we have those other multi channels that we also offer, whatsapp, our website chat. So, these different folders are how you're going to manage those different channels of communication… and then clicking on the support share mailbox, right? Since you're pretty much just focused on email, we'll focus on this one section and we do email very well. It's definitely our bread and butter. Once you click into the support share mailbox, it's going to open up sub views beneath it, that's going to help us manage the intake of communications. So, the first is the unassigned section, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be distributed. The next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me. And then there's the team view. So, just understanding what everyone on the team is currently working on in real time, what's outstanding and what needs to be completed… want to pause here? Any questions so far?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Just, I'm thinking out loud here. Do you guys, I'm seeing most of the interfaces based, on the gmo, front end or UI?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Is.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  there a way to integrate you guys to slack? Let's say that if there's a new ticket or a new request that is opening, it could also notify the team over slack.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's exactly correct. So, we have an integration where, if, you know, you're assigned something, a new email comes in. Your app mentioned, you can choose where the notifications get sent out into slack and to who?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay, perfect. Yeah. So that, that's a requirement in our end? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent, we, a lot of people, a lot of our customers use that integration heavily. And then we also have, so, going into the unassigned, right? Let me just click into this like an email for example. So, when I click into this email, a hiver tab is going to open up on the right hand side that can be opened or closed to help us manage the intake of those, communications and just manage the overall communication in general. So, the first thing we can do is assign a conversation. In this case, I'll assign it to myself. The next way we can assign work is a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the emails and tickets amongst the team. And then the last way is skill based routing. So, identifying keywords in the subject line, identifying keywords in the body of text, and then routing according based on those identifiers that we looked at, and then, making sure it gets to the right person.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay, perfect.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So there's, three different ways we can route, we can track the status, whether it's open pending or closed, making sure nothing slips between the cracks, adding those tags for organizational and analytical purposes on the backend. And then tracking custom fields. So we can create dropdown fields, date range fields, text, box, fields, and value fields to further organize information, track data and report on it on the backend. Okay? We want to take a quick temperature check. Any questions on the statuses, tags, custom fields?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  No, just maybe another question on the organization. Do you guys inherit? Like, do you parse customers by their email domain and then grouping them together for companies or how does it work?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we, by domain. So we like create, and organize the customer queries by domain. Okay?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Perfect. And then some of our customers, are within large organizations that have multiple domains. Is there a way to link those together?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, not currently, because we're more of like an intake or more of like an intake ticketing support tool versus like, a CRM, if you know what I mean?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  For sure. Yeah, I'm just, you know, I'm just asking whatever I have in mind, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, of course. And then the last thing over here is the collaboration aspect. So we can collaborate internally with other people. This will live on the side of the conversation, you know, throughout the history of it, and you can always come back and see these notes later, but I'll send this notification to matt, he'll, receive that notification, up, top, click on it, take him right to this thread where we can keep chatting back and forth. We have an AI sentiment analysis that can review all of the conversations and see how the client's feeling AI summarizers to get up to speed on the conversation quickly. And then a co pilot to draft replies, so we can feed our co pilot information. We can pull information from notion. Actually, we just released that integration today, to help your team respond to tickets by leveraging your data.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay. That's, that's helpful. We are… it's good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then I just insert it into the draft, you know, instead of having to search for that information, type it out, you know, we're just leveraging our data and AI, to drive efficiencies, and accuracy.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But what are your thoughts on this so far?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  So, a few questions I have in mind, where can I see? I'm moving like towards, more like, team leads or management? Is there a dashboard or an easier way to see like all activities and so on?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. So, the team view is a good place to see workload distribution.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you can see who's working what, but in terms of analytics, this is where we can see some good, metrics as well. Let's say we want to see the last 90 days, you know, here, we can see active new, resolve conversations over that time period, what our average first response time was as a group, our average resolution time?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Per user metrics, emails assigned, per user sent out per user over that time period, and then individual performance metrics from a first response or resolution time.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Wow. And then, is there a way to define, yeah, I see the dsla is new. Is there a way to define like maximum time to response and stuff like that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. So, going to the admin panel here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. We'll create a policy so you can create slas based on tag types as well? So, different tags and different conversation types can trigger a different SLA. So let's say we have a first response goal of one hour and a resolution goal of 24 hours when, you know, an urgent issue comes in.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  If we don't if we're not able to hit these markers, then you can choose who to escalate, and notify.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay, perfect. So, I'm just thinking about, the workflow, any ticket that we are receiving, we can do a push integration through slack so everyone in the company can see it over yep.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  And then we can also use that integration to notify any exceeding, events, based on dsla?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay, great. Perfect. Let's, unless there's anything else you want me to see?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  A few questions about, onboarding pricing, and then, that one is, if you guys have a startup program or not?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, how many people would you need to start on the platform?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  We work very differently, so, we don't have like a dedicated support team, basically, 90 percent of the company, are supporting it's like,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It's all hands on deck type thing, right? Yeah.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  So we really want everyone to be part of the product, and handle, any requests. So I would say, maybe start with, 15.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  15? Okay. Yeah. So, we sell buckets of five. So, five, 10, 15, 20. So, you started with 15, we are able to give a 15 percent discount off the top, for startups. So, and for what you're doing, I'd recommend the pro version, because this gives you up to five shared mailboxes, it gives you customer satisfaction, surveys, business hours, round Robin as well as, additional analytics from SLA, and the ability to export data. So, when,

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  you're when you're saying 45, that's 45 per bucket, right? Per five?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, per you, per user. So, I could, and, would you also want the AI features that we went over? Cause that is an additional cost that would go into the proposal?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Not sure if it's like super necessary since we are, in any case, like wrapping internally, running our, some of the models is based on data. So I would say, maybe let's start without it for now or at least for the quote?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And I'll pull up the proposal. Now, it's just so we can get some… eyes on it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, for 15 users on an annual commitment, it would be 6,885 dollars, annually, and you'd be paying a little over 38 point three per user.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay. And that's and let's say that, if I'm looking a year from today, we're expecting to be like about 100 employees. Is, is the price changes when the volume is higher or it still remains the same?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, throughout the contract, this will remain your expansion rate, but, you know, if you add 100 users over a year, like come renewal, you can negotiate for a better price for sure.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Got it. Okay. Great. And then, like last question, on our end, onboarding… time and resources, from you guys like implementation or whatever.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, we will provide you a dedicated customer success manager and I think that's honestly, you know, there's a lot of tools out there, but I think where we really shine is, our dedicated customer success team. So they'll provide implementation team training. It's going to be a completely white glove experience, to create a hiver environment that's mapped out to your business.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay, perfect. I think, oh, you know what? I have a, another, maybe a good question. Obviously, you guys are different than, than intercom, in some use cases, what makes you guys better, or differentiate the solution?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'd say for us, one, if you're a very email heavy company, which it sounds like you are. We are best in breed for email because we're native out of the Gmail client. So, we're just keeping that native email functionality while providing these additional, advanced customer support features in that Google workspace. So, which also just, in general, one less platform, you know, it's less technical overhead. We can get you up and running really quickly. It's it's not a tough tool to implement. So, speed time to value is very fast. And then in terms of just the level of support that you're going to get from us, you just wouldn't get from intercom?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay, perfect. Right. Yeah. So, I think that's all the questions I have for now. I'd really appreciate if you can send that quote over the email. And then it's probably going to take, minimum of like two or three weeks before we make the decision. What we're basically doing is that we have like, our RD team evaluating it. So, I'll put you guys in the pipeline as well. And we'll see their, output and, we'll take it from there.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. Could we touch base, let's say, Monday on the 20 fourth, same time just to see how, you know, if there's any other questions, as we're kind of wrapping things up?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  I mean, I think it's, early on the 20 fourth, maybe we can try on the 28 or the early December like December first or second?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, you're this is a, this is something you want to start implementing in December. So, this isn't for this month?

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  No, it's, we are thinking or hoping that it would be like, mid December or early January?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, I'll send over an invite. Does the same time work for now on December first?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And I just sent that, updated invite as well for the first.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay, perfect.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We also do offer a free trial. So, if this is something like, you want to test in the meantime, like we can get you set up with a free trial, just let me know and you can always set up that call.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Okay. Yeah, I'll, well, let me get in touch with our, R, D team, early Monday and then, we'll start, evaluating it and we'll take it from there again. I'm being super transparent. At least I haven't been familiar with hiver before, and we were looking to intercom. So, maybe it's a good, it's a good opportunity, to see the differences, and understand.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, and we also do offer live chat as well like intercom. So, we do offer, that as well.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I'll follow up this information. I'll send over this proposal, some other, things you can share with the team internally, like our roadmap, as well as just a product, overview. But, it was great to meet you, and I'll, I'll touch base with you soon.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  All right. Sounds good. Appreciate it. Cole. Thank you. All right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Take care.

Asaf Israelit (asaf@parter.ai):
  Bye, bye bye.
