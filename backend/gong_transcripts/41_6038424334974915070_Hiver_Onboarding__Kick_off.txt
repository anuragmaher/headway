================================================================================

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  I think… we are waiting for Arzu as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Can.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  we give her a moment? Oh, Lara is here, right? Hi, Lara.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Fabulous. Yeah, that's a higher note.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  It's good. You use your own products?

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Mr. Rakesh is also here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hey, Lara. Hey, Anna.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Hi, hi, Rakesh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi. Nice to meet you both. How are you doing?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Good. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well. Thank you. Do we also have Arzu joining in? She will.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Be in a couple of minutes. She's just finishing another meeting.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. I've already met Anna. So, yeah, this is the very first time I'm catching up with you, Lara. My name is Rakesh and I'll be the point of contact from here itself.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Manoj will be the onboarding manager. The idea today is to kick off start with hiver. We're going to be looking at the entire setup that we have done on the trial testing so far, move your account to the paid subscription, look into your questions in specific and help you rectify the account setup. And then the remainder of time in the meeting today will be utilized to give you guys a quick training.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Very nice. Sounds good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. All right.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  I have a quick question. Sure. I would like to know if our main account, business walks in Europe that's the account we all want to share. Yeah, is if this account is a user as well, or is it not a user?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  At the moment, I see it is added as a user, but do you have anybody logging in using business at the rate email address?

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Well, I.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  think I use it. Yeah, artsu uses it as well, I think.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And does that mean that you don't have an individual logging Lara?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  I do not, I did not set myself up as an admin, which I originally did with my Lara at walks in Europe. I can change that. Well. I don't want that actually.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  No, not for Lara but for northern Italy, perhaps because you are the one managing it.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  No, I think it's an admin aren't they.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  No, it's mailbox, admin, not full admin. I'm not sure of the difference, but I can either, yeah, go on. Lara, go on the way I'm.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  set up is fine because I access the business inbox to do what I need to do. So, the way that it's set up currently is okay on our side?

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. No. My question was if it's a user because we have a five user plan.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, that's what I was actually about to come to now, Lara, when you're actually logging into your Gmail account and you have access to your personal inbox as well as business inbox with hiver. You do not need to log in into business at the rate email, which meaning we don't really need business at walks in Europe as a user in hiver because it is otherwise an unnecessarily consuming one user seat for no cost.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  I think we need to take me off because I don't need it in my personal, Lara at walks in Europe box. Yes, I just need the business one because I help… R, to organize the emails coming into that box and tagging people and assigning to people.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. So that's coming into your business inbox, right? So that's where you need to tag people and assign these emails to people. Yeah, you want to overlook the business. Okay. Now, the right way to do is not to log in into business inbox, but to be inside your personal inbox. Now, once you are always in your personal inbox, you would be the administrator to manage all the emails coming into the business inbox. From there itself, you can assign emails, tag emails, manage the inbox, look at the team, supervise everything. So, all we are saying is the right setup and the recommended way would be that you don't need business as a login user, you would log in into your Gmail, still be the owner of the inbox manager of the inbox, and you have complete visibility.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Does that make sense? Anna? Does it sound good?

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  For us, I think so. I think so, because if you log in through northern Italy, I just made you admin so you can still do all the things that you need to do in the business inbox, you can still tag and you can still do everything because I think you will be the main user for that anyway. If I'm right?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Basically, Anna, what I see is today, I see there are seven users. One is Lara herself, which is the main inbox user. We'll let it be as it is business at the rate inbox is supposed to be a shared mailbox. We would remove that email address as a user because we don't want to incur extra cost. Then is Anna at the rate your company domain, which is yourself, Anna. So we will leave that user account as it is, no, no, we will.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  be deleting that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you don't need to be a part of the inbox. I do not.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  I don't need access to that. No, no, no, okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Then we have Paris team, northern Italy, team operations, and we have Tuscany, Naples. So, these are the four different inboxes that we have today as a user logins. Okay? Are these going to be the shared inboxes or the users as such in the setup?

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  So, removing Anna? Okay. That leaves us with six, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Correct. So I can put you in the non billing for now. I don't have to remove you, but I can put you in the non billing for now. Okay? Because until we are completely done with the onboarding, I don't want you to lose the access.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. I.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  will not be using it as much, but for now, yes.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. I think we can also, so we can also do business as a user and be just a shared mailbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, or we delete Lara's personal and leave Lara access through northern Italy. What do you think, Lara? What would you prefer?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  I would prefer to remove my personal.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you would never log in into Lara, at the rate on hiver extension. You would always log in using business or northern Italy. Okay?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Business or Tuscany, Naples?

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Sorry, Tuscany, Naples. Yes, my mistake. Sorry.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So we're going to be removing Lara, individual inbox. Yeah.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Makes sense. All right. Hi, Arzu. Nice to meet you.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  You are muted. Arzu.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Hi, rakeh.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hey, nice to meet you. Thank you for joining in.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Thanks.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Now, before you join in, we would actually try to look into rectification of accounts. We're trying to see how many users do not require hiver access.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We want to finalize the final count of users and obviously look at the entire setup one more time. And then we'll take care of the entire training. Okay? We've got Manoj with us. Manoj is going to be the onboarding manager for the account to assist us with the training and onboarding. Everybody. And, yeah, so we were going look at the account and we noticed that we do not require Anna to be a part of the actual licensing. Lara mentioned that she herself does not want to log in into Lara inbox, but she would see if she could log in using Tuscany, Naples as well as the northern Italy as a user login. And then we have business email. We have got operations. We have got Paris team. All these fives are going to be the users. One business then is Naples, Paris, northern Italy, and the operations inbox?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, as a shared mailbox, we have currently set up everything on business at the rate inbox. Is there any other email address that we require? Where these emails are coming? And we want to share it amongst Naples, Paris team operations and anybody else?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  No.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So that's going to be the primary one inbox, where we will receive all the emails and the other inboxes are more of a user logins for now. Yes, very clear. All right. Fair enough.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  So, no, no, no. Okay. You know, gave me an idea. Fiverr is priced on per user.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's right? Not.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Per shared inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It's priced on per user, but your plan has access to three mailboxes. Currently, we have one business at the rate inbox, you still have access to create two more mailboxes which your Paris team, your Naples team, your operations team, your business team can still share. Very.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Nice. This is what we needed and Lara maybe to solve our Tuscany team problem too that I'm trying to solve.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  We can have hiver in that mailbox too. No. Okay. I'll ask you later.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Yeah, we can figure it out. I mean, does your Tuscany team receive so many emails or how many people are managing it or is that just one person managing the Tuscany inbox?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  At the moment, three?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. And are these three people managing the Paris team inbox as well?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  No different people?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. And these three people that are managing the Tuscany inbox today, are they part of hiver subscription already?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Tuscany team at worksineurope. Com, as a user is a user for hiver?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood, which meaning that anybody who is having a login for Tuscany user logs in into hiver and manages the emails coming into the business inbox as well as Tuscany inbox. Yes. But when you say emails which directly come into Tuscany inbox from customers, are you saying that there are three people who are managing those emails?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah, correct.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And who are these three people? If I may understand, so that I can help you with the recommended setup?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Lara, Roberta, Rebecca? Okay. Romantic Italian woman's, name? Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, basically, we have Lara as a common user, but we have removed her and put into the non billing because she is preferring to log in into business inbox. Yeah.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Correct. Yeah, because I want her to look into that instead of me. Okay. So, Lara has two personalities.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  She takes care of the business inbox. Instead of me.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  And then she takes care of the, she's a member of the Tuscany team as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  With two other people, fair enough.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And Rebecca is not yet added into hiver?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  No.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Very clear. Manoj, do you see the exact mix and match of the different users that are managing multiple inboxes today?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Just a couple of questions here, guys. So, the emails that are being sent to Tuscany team, Paris team or northern Italy, right? Do they also get delivered into business ad for the entire team to see?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  No.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  No, okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  There's one big common inbox called business. Okay. All the customer inquiries land in business. Okay. And instead of 20 people going into business, we divided it into four groups, four teams, Paris, Tuscany, venice, Athens… but Tuscany is now getting into the business inbox with their Tuscany team at walks in Europe account, which is another inbox.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  That doesn't receive customer inquiry that's an operational inbox?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Something internal that you guys use to manage they?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Talk to each other. They talk to the guides, for example, any operational thing that happens between us. So, each member of the Tuscany team, for example, Lara, Roberta and Rebecca, they log into the Tuscany team inbox, with their own emails. All right. Walks in Europe, Roberta, whatever. So, three people gets into Tuscany and then Tuscany goes to business.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  In that case, Manoj, would we recommend that we keep one business as a main inbox, yes, and operations as another main inbox, exactly?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  We can.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  still route the Tuscany emails into the operations one as an alias, correct? Which meaning Lara, Rebecca yourself and the business email. If that has been logged in by Lara, we can still log in using our individual gmails, but manage the operations inbox, business inbox, right? From within the Gmail. Yeah. So that could be one setup. And then the Naples and Paris team that you have, we can maybe manage these two separate inboxes within hiver. So, okay, let me tell you.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  The, so Rakesh, just a suggestion, right? So, you know, few cases like the emails that are being sent to Tuscany or Paris is either operational, right? Rarely a customer email right now, this can be automated or, you know, just added to the business or the operations share mailbox by the person who's actually logging into. And then the team will still be able to access those emails in either of those mailboxes,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Or otherwise, we can treat them as an alias as well, right? I mean, instead of just managing them individually.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Now, since these are actual Gmail user accounts, making… them as aliases might not work because that is a setting that we'll have to do in Google workspace as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. We'll have to change them into aliases in Google workspace. And only then you can add them as aliases. In hiver.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, the reason I'm saying is Manoj, why do we want to pay for a user inbox? When you're actually paying on hiver to manage these mailboxes, we literally don't require these accounts as users in Google workspace. If these are just the distribution lists or aliases or Google groups that will still serve the purpose in hiver? Because we are just routing the emails, right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. See that 100 percent works, right? If you are open to try out like one single account by changing them, Google settings as well as hiver settings, we can work that out, right? Otherwise, if let's say that you either way want the account and within hiver, if you want to use your, any of the user's address as users itself, you can simply set up forwarding from, oh, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, Arzu, just so, you understand, this is for your reference of what Manoj and I were discussing is about the different mailboxes that you have in your Google workspace today. These all are the user accounts, which meaning that you are paying for these users in Google workspace. Yes. Now, these emails, one of these example is the Tuscany inbox, which still does not receive emails from the external customers but is used for the internal operations. Now, instead of paying Google workspace for this user account. Now that you have a solution like hiver, we can always treat this email address as a Google workspace group address or an alias address, which meaning we don't have to pay Google to, for this user account. We would always change the settings. And in hiver, we can treat Tuscany inbox as an alias and the main emails, whichever are there in the, you know, whichever are set to the Tuscany inbox, can still be routed to your main business inbox, or it could be routed to any other inbox wherever you choose to make this as an alias to. So you no.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  No, repeat your last sentence.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, instead of making,

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  because we don't want operational Tuscany emails in the business inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Fair enough. Any other inbox where these emails can still be forwarded to as an ad hoc basis… or you want to keep operations as an operation inbox for the internal work?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Yes. Imagine like this, we have user level, every person has an account on Google… then we have team accounts like a shared inbox, for example, Tuscany team has three people log in. They use the same password. Maybe there's another setting, but I don't know I was trying to figure it out. They log into the same inbox, and they share the operational emails within the three of them.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, understood.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  That's totally separate. We use that account for the three of them to see the business account. That's why we have Tuscany team at walksineurope. Com. They log in with that one. And then they, okay. But there are two separate things to manage.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  One internal inbox and second sharing password to look at the business, operations inbox. Yes. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, in that case, Manoj, I don't think we need to change anything at the back end. I think we can keep the Tuscany inbox for the operations and whoever has to log in will always log in, use the Tuscany inbox credentials. Yeah, right. And then we can manage operations inbox. Particularly business is going to be the main inbox, which will be logged in by yourself. If you need to do that or otherwise, Rebecca, we have valara, we have got other team members, whoever need to log in. And then we have got other two Naples and Paris inbox individually. These can be still managed with these users' login. Yep. For now, I don't see that we have added Rebecca as a colleague. So we can always do that.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Exactly.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's how the setup would look like for you.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So just a question. So we will create another mailbox under operations, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, the operations mailbox is not yet created. It's a user login. So I would say create an operation inbox, and we let Lara and other folks log into their Gmail and still manage the operation inbox as well.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  I think we'll do that later. Let's only do business for now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Fair enough. It's a little bit complicated for us.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Manoj. Do you want to just quickly look at the entire settings on the account and see if there is anything that needs to be changed? We have actually restricted… the account to five users for now and we can just go through that, maybe Lara, if you could share your screen because you are the administrator at the moment. Maybe if you can just log in into your Gmail show us the screen and we'll look into the quick settings, and then we can always do a quick training for you all.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Thank you.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So right now, the five users are business at Tuscany team, Paris, team, northern Italy and operations… these are going to be the five active users each, and everybody will be logging into these five different accounts. And from within this account, they manage the business at email address, which is the chat mailbox, the primary one. They'll still have emails that are directly sent to Tuscany, northern Italy and Paris, and they can just use their own personal inbox to manage them as well, correct?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Correct in?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Case, if any of those emails need to be added to business at like by chance, if they receive a customer email or something, they can just simply add it to the chat mailbox and the team can handle it.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So that's how the current setup is. I presume Lara and Anna will be removed as users… right? So, Rakesh, are we going to remove them right away or like basically after the setup?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  After the setup, I want to make sure everything is all completed and then I move the account to the paid subscription, but I want to make sure that these are the ultimate five users that we require or if we require any setup changes, we can look at it right now because the only thing that I am a little concerned about is if business at the rate inbox is already used as a shared mailbox. Is there a definite need to use a login for user as a user login for business? Or would it be better that we use Lara as an individual user to login so that she can manage Tuscany, she can manage business and she can manage even operational inboxes later. So that's just one point I would like to revisit here. So.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Let me just quickly share my screen and I'll show you what happens when you're like, you know, when you literally log into business at, and handle business at email address… screen.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Again, there is no right or wrong way. Arzu, it's just that the recommendations are the best way to manage it. I understand. But at the end of the day, if Lara is more comfortable logging into business at the rate inbox, there is no hard and fast rule. We can absolutely let her log in into business inbox, still manage business operations or whatever mailboxes that she wants to manage. We just want to make sure that you are aware about both the scenarios and choose the best one as per your choice.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, how we normally do is I log into my account and… I handle all of these mailboxes. So finance can be my internal mailbox, like your operations. And then support is your business mailbox.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  So, in your, what we're looking at is two or more than two different kinds of shared inboxes, right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, I have like, I think I have five of them.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. So you have five of them at the moment, we only have one shared, which is business? Yes. Ah, okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So normally, what happens? Let's say that Rebecca or Lara and yourself, right? You all are being users and the mailboxes can be your, you know, operations business or Tuscany team or Italy team, something like that. Yeah. Okay. Those will be like the shared inboxes and you basically log in using your address, just see what the Paris team is handling. Okay? Then you can just close it. You see what business is handling, then you can remove it. And then you,

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  can I don't think we need it? No, I don't want to see the shared inbox of Paris, for example. Okay. Got it. It's their own operational, whatever.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then for now, we can just have business and going forward, you can have operations as well as the shared mailbox, okay? And then you can have the rest of the users as it is.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. They're just going to have one shared inbox for the moment.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Got it.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  That was one thing I just wanted to show, yep, having multiple mailboxes and logging into users. Yeah. But then the current setup is fine. As I explained, now, that are going forward with the setup under… the business at account, right? Next step would be like, have you guys created the tags? Automations? Slas, yep, everything is set.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  We set up some of them. I don't think we've done everything we wanted, but we're at a good start. I think a few tags. Okay. A lot has been active as well, creating tags and users and the, yeah, some of the things.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And do you want?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Did we answer the themes on the private tours? Like wine tours, family tours, whatever?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Good.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Manoj. We want to see some analytics like how many wine tours did we run this year? If we tag it as a wine tour or how many wine tour inquiries did we receive?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yes. So that's pretty simple. Do I show it on your setup? Or should I share my screen? And I will show you how to take it.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Which is, I think, do you want us to share our screens or how do you?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. If anyone of you guys like Lara or Anna, if you guys share your screen, I'll just show you how it's.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  done for the business inbox? Yes?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah, it looks a little bit different. I don't have the same capabilities… that I had because it says the account is suspended.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Ah, okay.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  So the analytics button, for example, I know you can add. You can see it looks like this. And here it says account suspended.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Because our trial has ended.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  What?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Our trial has ended? Yeah.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  I know we have access to analytics and so we can see which emails, how many emails came in that had to do with wine experiences, for example?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And then we can take, okay. Yeah, go ahead. Just a second. Lara, can you just refresh your screen? It shouldn't get suspended. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Can you click on the hiver icon? Click on it. Which account are you logged into business?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Just a second. Rakesh, are you checking that? Because on the backend, the trial is active… that's what I want to check?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'm checking that.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  The trial is active. Rakesh. I just, can… you reload… again, Lara, your Gmail?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Say it again? Sorry?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Can you refresh your Gmail again? Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, you guys have been tagging things as Tuscany and then Paris and all of these tags, right? So, if you go into analytics?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  On the left, the reports are all predefined. So first, if you want to make like a conversation based report, you click on analyze on the graph. So we are now looking into the active conversation report on the top right? Lara, do you see filters scroll up filters? Yeah, here, you choose for what tag? Do you want to see the active conversations report for? Okay. Now, over here, you either select your winery or Paris or whatever tags that you want to check out for?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. Can we even take it one more step? For example? Can we only see we received 100 inquiries from this tag, but we were able to sell 30 of them. How can we manage that?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  You're able to sell 30 of them? And do we have any kind of identification for that? Yeah.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Can we see two filters at one report?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, you can multi select the tags.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. Good. Yes. So wine sold. Yeah. So if we do sold, for example, I think this answers Sonia's request. I think so too. Yep. Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, you can have like the wine tours as a tag and then you can have a custom field drop down saying it's pending or like, you know, it's canceled or sold something like that and you can have both in the report and you can download these reports.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Very good.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, instead of always going forward and filtering this on the left hand side, Lara, do you see custom reports?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah, you can save it. Okay?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  On the left hand side, scroll down right below sentiment. You see custom reports. Yeah, click on the plus symbol. Yeah, sure. Like now you build the report from scratch. Okay? So you basically wanted the number of conversations that you're handling under each tag or you just want like based on any of these metrics, you can start building a report for all those important tags and you can have them as separate reports. Okay. That's good. The wine tours as a report, the Paris team as a report, all of these can be individual and it gets auto populated. So every time you don't have to go into conversations to filter them, you simply expand the custom reports and see your custom report and then download them anytime.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Also, okay. They do have access to the custom dashboards as well, right?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Yep, they do.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yep. So on the top, Lara, do you see custom dashboards like the dashboards right next to reports? Yeah. Yes on it. So here, like how you see the widgets, similar… to this, you create your own dashboard. So it's just one click quick view for like how many users are working on the email, how many tags have been applied and what are the average response time? All of these can be added in as widget? Okay. So for example, like click on create new dashboard… name it.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  For example, sales sold, tours dashboard?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Next, so first under workload matrix, let's choose new conversations. Yeah… shared inbox to business… group by, do you want to group by tag? Do you want to group by tags tag?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Yes.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, this widget is added. Now, can you on the right hand side, Lara, can you go back on new conversations? Just the back arrow. Yeah. Now, choose resolved conversations… choose the mailbox and again group by. So you have these widgets appearing and you build the dashboard from here. Nice.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  What does resolved mean? Is it closed?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes. Closed.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. Good.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Similarly, you can have like, I think more than like 10 to 15 widgets in a single dashboard. So split the dashboards by as you mentioned sold tours as a dashboard, then new sales as a dashboard, new customers as a dashboard. So you can have these widgets, and it's easier for you to track them as well.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. Or by team harris? Yeah. Okay. Good.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And in the future, let's say you have two different shared mailboxes, and you want to see team emails between these two mailboxes, like Paris team, you might have emails in operations as well as in business, right? You can include both of them in a single dashboard. It still will give you a clean graph of what happened in operations and what happened in business.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Any questions on analytics? And you also have an export option. Guys like if you want to download a CSV file directly to your inbox. So, Lara, if you go to reports, the… last option on the left, scroll down exports. Yeah, there you go.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah, cool.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, basic metrics. And if you click on choose columns, the last option, you will see what all data you're going to get in the CSV. Wow.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Amazing.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, you can, you know, you can uncheck whatever is not necessary for you and just keep the ones that you require. And the CSV file will have everything basically just open it in sheets and you have it right there. Nice… and the same. Sorry, yeah, please go ahead.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  The.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  same set of details can also be filtered based on individual tags or users. So, if you want to get all of this data just for one particular user, you can get that using the filter by option. Yeah.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Can you go back to the inbox? I want to ask you something. Do you see the one, two, three? The fourth one from the top, it has a red.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  FRT. Yes, the SLA?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah. What is it?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  That is the SLA policy that you have set for the mailbox, it's basically first passport, can?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  We delete it. Yes, yes, we can.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  It is.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Because we receive customer inquiries from the us generally when it's overnight for us, and then we reply to it in a day or two?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Understood. Okay. Lara, can you click on the hiver settings icon on the top, right? Let me check your SLA settings.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Admin panel?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Oh,

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  just scroll down and you should see SLA… or in the middle of the screen. Yeah, scroll down.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah. Here we go. SLA?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  It is disabled right now. Yeah. Was that? I think it was added a while back?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Now, can you click on edit anyways over here on this SLA policy because arzul here's the thing if you have. Yeah. So right now, if you notice the operational hours is set to calendar hours right now, if you do want to have SLA, you can set it up based on your business hours… so that emails coming outside business hours, the timer will not run for those emails. It will only start from the moment that you log in and it will stop when you log out. Let's say like you're logging in at eight a. M and you're logging out at like five P. M… emails coming at five PM or after five P. M, the SLA timer?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Will not run for them. Can we do the setting? Like that? Yes, eight a. M cet until five P. M cet. And first response is 24 hours.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, we can. Yeah. Now, for that first on the left hand side Lara the settings that you have, can you go to the last option right below users and roles… the settings towards the left of that?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Below that.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Ah,

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  below? Yeah, business R templates. The second option… create business R templates.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Let's enter cet?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  There it's here.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Template name?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Template name, common cet. Let's do like that common cet. Because that's the most one we use, no.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. And the time zone is correct, right?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Correct.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, scroll down.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  So, why is it saying plus one rom? We want three rom?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  What did you want it? Eight a. M. You?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Simply drag and drop? Yeah.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Eight a. M5 P. M. Six P. M. Yeah. Does anyone work until six? I don't know?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  I don't know, I don't let's.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  make it five. I think six is too long.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  And then can we just copy and paste this all the way over? Or do we have to drag and drop for each individual?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you have to drag and drop individual because sometimes in the middle of the day or the week, you might have breaks and that's why you saw the gap in the on, like in Tuesday?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Oops, I can't move you as a whole, oh, dear.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Sunday, we can end the day at three P. M, I think.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Oh, my gosh.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  So, well.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  We're not closed on Sunday or something.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you just click on it?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah, ah.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  You can.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Just click it here, right? Does it default to nine o'clock when you click on it? Oh, no, it doesn't.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  ah, it.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Depends on why you click?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  On it. Yeah… I'm not using my mouse right now. So, it's very annoying.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  I can actually feel a lot of it. Yeah, we have given this feedback. We're planning to, you know, just have… the numbers in a drop down or copy, paste it, which will be like much more user friendly.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Very good. Do you want eight to three on Saturday or two?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Scroll.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Down.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Set holiday. All right?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  You can do that later anyways. You just say it. Yeah, now go into shared inboxes on the left, Lara. Yep, click on business. Now, scroll all the way to the bottom, the first settings that you clicked below SLA, this one, click on settings. Oh… now, set the business hours here. Ah, the second drop down.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Huh. Very nice.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Save. Yeah. Now go into SLA.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  And then activate it and.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Edit it.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, first, edit it. Okay. It's going to be for all conversations that are coming into the mailbox now, check the box, which says, consider only business hours.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Ah, now.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Set the first response time to 24 hours.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And make the 30 minutes to zero and the resolution time hours… 48 or 72 hours or do you want a resolution time? I?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Don't think we want a resolution time, it will take as long as it will take.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it, to note on the first response time on the right hand side, do you see, notify Lara? Yep. Do you want notify specific users or just the?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Assignee? We don't know who the, assignee?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can just select assignee and assigner then, so that.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Nice. So, let's say, if I see this email and I think that the Paris team has to deal with it, I assign Paris team and then we can check if it has been responded within 24 hours.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yes, yes, you can. Yeah, but,

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  you should get some, we should get some sort of alert.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you get notified, alert. Yes, you get notified.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  You Arzu, as the person who assigned it and paras', team as the one who was assigned to, will both get that.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yep. Yeah. Click apply… and then update SLA policy… done. Okay. Nice. Now, since it's 24 hours even on the first day, if you don't respond, the timer is gonna stop at five PM and then it's gonna resume from the next day, eight am nice.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. Good. And let's say if it's in the red, it will stay in the red until it's closed.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. It's gonna stay in the red forever because, yeah, because the response time has been missed. So that is a notification stating that it's response time, but for the older emails, you can go simply and remove it right now. How go back to Gmail. Yeah, open the email… on the right hand panel. Just a second, click on the drop down where it says first response overdue sins. You should see a delete option right there.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Oh, okay. That's nice. Oh, that's okay. What about all these funny tags there? It's created auto, and we don't touch them. Yes, all of these.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So for SLA policies for the tags and everything, we use Gmail labels functionality so that we'll be able to push these emails into the correct sections of the mailbox, okay? And for the syncing purposes?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Nice.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Any other question guys?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  I have a question about contacts. Okay? So we want our marketing person to have the most updated contacts, you know, like monthly, we would go, and we would send her the updated contacts, for example, so she knows to reach out to new people who have recently contacted us rather than manually go in and add contacts to our, you know, sheet that we're sending her? Is there any way that this can automatically be done where, you know, once and,

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  just a note. We use MailChimp. If we can send it to MailChimp directly? Okay?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Yeah. Can we, can this be like auto done? Where to eliminate the manual work of taking new contacts, finding new contacts that contacted us, taking them, putting them in a spreadsheet, you know what I mean? Right?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Or classify them, for example, some of them. Just reached out. Some of them. This is opportunity. Some of them is a sold customer and she wants to send them different. The marketing manager wants to send them separate newsletters, for example.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  But the.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  manual? Yeah.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. Go ahead.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, Lara here's, the thing first thing, an automation is not available, but you can export the contacts from your hiver account.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  If that works out, you have an export option in your admin panel where you can export the notes, templates and contacts. Yeah. And for the time being, you know, you can, but, yeah, I'll share the feedback with the team. But for the time being, you can use the export option to get the, what?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Do we get when we export just the names? Can we also get the tag for it? For example, Jane smith from the us. Company… owner contacted… us? Nothing happened.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So it's going to be the email address and the name, but the tags are not going to be possible.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Okay. So if… we exported, this is what's available?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  What about companies? Companies? The list of the same thing?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  So, companies are basically the domains of your contacts. Yeah. So it's anyways, going to be there in the export file?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  And the export, let me just quickly show, you go into admin panel Lara.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Can we do something like this on the AI? Somehow classify this for us?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Classify the contacts?

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Like this, we want to do two major classifications. Someone who has a Gmail, yahoo, I don't know whatever hotmail account and reached out. My name is Mary, I want to do a tour tomorrow. Can you help me a person… separate it from a company? So there's a domain name and they want to do a corporate thing. And then of course, there's another customer type. Is there a thing on the AI that can do this for us?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Okay. So the AI on the contacts is not yet there, but if you don't want free Gmail or yahoo or hotmail. Com to be registered as companies, you can exclude that in the list so that it doesn't get registered as a company, only the actual domains get registered as companies, and you can use the tags to manage those yahoo or hotmail accounts. Now go into the settings, Lara, the last option in the list… do you see contact settings… now? This is where you exclude. Okay. So as I mentioned, if you notice Gmail. Com, hotmail. Com, outlook. Com, all of these are like an exclusion.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  They're also excluded already. Okay?

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And now go into export data, Lara. And here, you can export the contacts, email templates, draft notes?

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Okay.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  I think I'm fine.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  I don't have any other questions? No.

Lara Pellegrini (lara@walksineurope.com):
  Me, neither.

Arzu Tutuk (arzu@walksineurope.com):
  Thank you, Manoj. Is there anything else you want to tell us? Do you want to finish this thing on the top? Where it says hiver setup three of six done.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Is there anything we should know there? Can you click on that? Then? What else is left? It's just demo inbox and learn.

Manoj Kiran (manoj@grexit.com):
  About hiver AI. Again, once Rakesh moves the plan on the back end, this thing goes off. So you don't have to worry about it. This is just part of the onboarding flow that we have because some customers when they are setting up or when they're starting the hiver trial, they would want to set up automations and everything like right away. So they just go through the onboarding flow and get that sorted. But apart from that, it's nothing.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Concerning… that's. All from me.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Thank you, Manoj. Thank you, everybody. Arzu, there must be an invoice from my finance. You could take your time, clear that. And once I have it is the back to us too, or do you want a monthly credit card? How does it work? Yeah, the invoice has a payment link so you can click on the link and use your credit card. So it'll be like a month on month itself.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  It's auto. Yeah, yes, it would be OK.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And apart from that, I think there's nothing much pending. But should you still need any more training?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you have any more questions? Both Manoj and I will drop my calendar after the meeting. Feel free to book a meeting with any one of us and we'll be able to reconnect again. Thanks.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  A lot. All right. And I have a question. Yes, Rakesh, just one last thing, would you like to remove me as a user? So, me and,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lara, perhaps our individual emails… sure. I'll make sure I take you to the non billing and then you're not billed for it. OK? Thank you. All right. Great. Thank you so much for everybody's time. And like I always say, if you have any more questions, please do not hesitate. Feel free to write back. We'll be right there for you.

Anna Isaeva (anna@walksineurope.com):
  Thank you. Have a great day. All right. Bye bye. Thank you so much. Bye thank you. Thank you guys. Bye bye bye bye.
