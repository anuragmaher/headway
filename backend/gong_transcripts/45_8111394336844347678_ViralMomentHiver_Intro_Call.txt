================================================================================

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, matt. Hey, Aaron, how you doing?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good, good. Appreciate you joining today.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Yeah, of course. Love the bay area background. Are you based in San Francisco?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, no, it's just one of the stock ones. I'm actually in Los Angeles. How about yourself?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I'm actually in Texas, but I'm from norcal, so I spent all my life in northern California.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Nice.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Yeah. What?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Part of Texas, are you in?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I'm in far east Texas, like basically Louisiana, so.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  So,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  you didn't want to be with the crowds in Austin?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  No, no. You know, I really like it. We're super rural. So it's nice.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, I had a brief stint where I lived in Dallas for like four months and then I drove across the state a bit. So, yeah, I can imagine it's quite rural where you are.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Yeah, and it's quite the drive to get back to California. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I believe it. I believe it. Well, perfect. Well, appreciate you joining. Like I said, agenda for the call today, just wanted to spend maybe the first minute or so learning a little bit more about you. Anything that was top of mind or maybe interested you in taking this meeting today. I don't expect you to know much about hiver. So it's completely fine. And then from there, I'll tell you a little bit about us and our product and answer the questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Yeah, it sounds great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So, yeah, just to give you some background here, you know, hiver is a help desk platform, right? So, was there anything that was top of mind that maybe interested you in taking this meeting today or?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Yeah. I mean, this was definitely a kick down to me from our CEO. So I was just, I kind of looked into you guys briefly our CS team. We are in an active scaling moment right now. So we really are looking for the best way to streamline our responses to clients, how we interact with our clients and also trying to find that sweet spot in between over managing them and kind of just letting them come to us when they need it. So a help desk is definitely something that's been on our radar as something we'll be needing as we scale.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. And then how many support team members do you have right now and how many are you looking to grow too?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Yeah, we're at about five to six right now, there's one that's part time. So we're right there right now. I think by the end of the year, we're looking at, you know, maybe a few more like two to three more, but then large scale would be like definitely in our view.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. And so you don't have a help desk platform right now, right?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  No, we don't everything is just email communications, you know, Google meet everything like that?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Email, do you have like a shared email address that they reach out to like a support ad or anything like?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  That, we do have like a help ad email that we can leverage at times, but for the most part, it's actually typically to CSM specific. So, you know, client CSM. And as you know, when people come into, you know, I'm sick for the week or I have to take emergency time off. It's really annoying to kind of lose that contact with the client for that amount of time if nobody else is looped in.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So, yeah, we could support a little bit of, you know, these emails going to individuals. But yeah, the best use case for hiver would be to be actively using that help ad email address. But yeah, we also have ways to stay up to date with personal, emails being shared with other team members as well. So, yeah, but definitely, yeah, most of hiver is built around having a shared email address like help ad that way. Like you said, nothing falls through the cracks if somebody's out of office for whatever reason, it's just really easy to pick it up with hiver. And then are you using Gmail, or are you using outlook?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  We're using Gmail. Okay… perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Sounds good. And is there any kind of like timeline in place for when you want to help desk platform?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I think we'd be looking within the next, you know, two to four months realistically, but that kind of just depends on conversations and how they go, okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah, just going to walk through a couple slides here… right? So, so, you know, right now, there's a big pivot in customer service, right? Customers today, want answers instantly. They want them across different channels and they expect every interaction to feel personal and effortless. And the shift is not about just about technology but how teams kind of serve people that matter, most? Okay. And where hiver kind of stands here is that, you know, a lot of the issues that teams are having right now is they they're the information scattered across different chats, different emails, different systems. No one really knows the single source of truth. There's constant manual work which is draining productivity and increasing stress and then leaving no time for real customer engagement. So, you know, with hiver, it's easy to use a single source of truth. You'll have visibility across all these different channels that you have. And then we can also set up rule based workflows for complex scenarios. And, you know, one of the main reasons people choose hiver over the other platforms is that hiver is really easy to use. It's easy to use. Easy to set up. We have 24 seven support. You know, there's a lot of really… big help desk platforms out there, right? You know, I'm thinking companies like Zendesk, right? That are clunky and they're for, you know, big teams, right? And for a team of five that's going to scale to 20 people, you know, you probably don't need some big clunky help desk platform. You just need a flexible tool and that's really where hiver is. And yeah, and then we also have tons of different AI features which I can show you today which is save a bunch of time for you. And just a little background about hiver. We've been around from since 2017.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We've raised over 30,000,000 dollars in funding. We have over 10,000 teams using hiver across 50 countries ranging from small businesses all the way up to some of the largest companies in the world, companies like capital one, the casa, and flexport, just to name a few. And it's really across all different sectors. So, you know, while it is easy to use easy to set up, it can also be quite powerful as we have multiple companies that have over a 1,000 licenses and are managing many different departments, not just support and some of the time saving, you know, Roi you can expect to see with hiver is like the following, flexport is a global freight company struggling with visibility and missing emails across their operational teams after switching to hiver, they achieved full visibility into issue resolution and ensured that no customer messages were ever being lost. And then within weeks, their email resolution improved by over 50 percent, saving nearly 387 hours every month. And yeah, just got visibility across it all. So perfect. Let's go ahead and hop into it. Can you see my screen? Yeah. Awesome. So hiver's another big difference with hiver is a Gmail extension.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We're a certified Google partner. So you just simply download the Gmail extension. Once you download it, you're going to see these yellow icons in the top right and then down here on the bottom left. So you're going to be able to answer your personal emails just like normal. They're not connected to hiver. And then from there, you're going to have access to the different channels that you have. So the main channel that we support is email. So how it works is you might have a folder called support and it's going to be tied to that help at email that you have.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  OK, this.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Way, you know, anybody who needs access to it just conveniently has access to this folder and they can see all the emails that come in.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Gotcha. OK?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And this is without, you know, having to open a different platform up or anything like that. It's all right here. All your notifications are up here as well. OK. So then how it works is once somebody emails that help address that you have, it's going to land in the unassigned folder. So the unassigned is basically just telling you that this hasn't been assigned to somebody yet. OK? So let's just click on one of these. And when you open an email, once you have hiver installed, you're going to see the panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can assign it to each other. So a new email comes in. We want this to go to matt. Matt is then going to get notified and it's going to be in his mind folder now.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Nice. OK.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So everyone's going to have their own mind section where they can just easily see the emails that are assigned to them. There's also tags to categorize this, right? So like what kind of support issue is this? Is this a billing issue? Is this, you know, an AI issue et cetera, and you can apply tags to it so that you can categorize, these tickets coming in. OK? So essentially, what hiver does is hiver just takes these emails for you and kind of turns them into tickets for you to work? Yeah?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Definitely. Is there anywhere where you can review like what was done this week or what was done this month? Like a good at a glance? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I'll get to that. OK?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  No, sorry.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, no, it's good. You definitely can. Yep, we have, so we have reporting and then we have different views which I'll show you, which shows that. So, yeah, I showed you how to make and then their statuses, right? So open pending closed. If this was done, right? It didn't need any work. You can just move it to close et cetera. But also, you know, I showed you how to assign it and tag it. We have automations that can do that automatically as well. OK?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  So, like if X comes in from this client, we know it's going to go to Erin because it's her client.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly exactly. So, yeah, we can set lists with accounts, right? So if that your customer emails in, we can have it automatically get assigned to you. That's one way we can do it off. We can also do it off keywords, which is a popular one too. So like, you know, if you hand, if someone on the team handles all the billing questions. So if an email comes in and it's about a billing issue, hiver can automatically recognize that and can automatically get assigned to that person as well. Awesome. So we have a lot of different automations. They can be based on domains keywords. And then we also have AI tagging as well now. So AI is basically, you tell on the back end which type… of emails get, which types of tags. So hiver can essentially recognize that the email is about a billing issue, and then can automatically categorize it as billing and then assign it to the right person. Okay? Then there's custom fields. These can be drop downs. They're all customized text fields, anything custom you're looking to track?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  And then,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  here's the notes section. So this actually is a little bit of a snapshot too. So this shows like when the email came in, what changes were made, who it went to. So all that's tracked. You can also add notes here, you hit the at mention button, everyone's name in the account pops up and it's like, hey, Cole, can you help with this? And then Cole would get notified that I've asked him to help on this email.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I love it. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And, as a 200 person company that's a big one for us too, right? Like let's just say there's a prospect I'm working with and they're emailing into support. The support team is always just going to go like, hey, matt, you know, please reference this email, you know. So I easily just get notified. I can see it. I go from there… you can also reply to the emails directly here in hiver. Of course, you can set up email templates for those kind of reoccurring emails that you get just to save time. We also have a chat gpt built into it too. So you can just conveniently fix the grammar, make it shorter et cetera. Which is actually a huge time saver. And then we have an AI copilot which can actually draft replies for you. It's going to ask a four prompt question. You choose the prompt you want just for accuracy purposes. And it will actually go ahead and draft a reply for you. It learns from the emails that you've been getting. And it can also cross reference documents, snippets… knowledge base and notion as well. If you guys use notion. Nice. Yeah. So it can provide contextual answers. You can adjust the tone. You can talk to it. It's part of gpt five which is one of the most powerful AI systems out there. So, yeah, there's a lot of things here and this could save a huge amount of time. Definitely… awesome. Any questions so far about how the emails will come into that help address or?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  No, it's making a lot of sense. Okay? Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Another thing you can do too. Let's just say you get a personal email from one of the customers, right? They email your personal address. You can see that there's an add to shared mailbox button here. So you can just simply add it to the mailbox… boom. So now, if I add it now, everybody can see that. Nice, right? So now it's here. It's in hiver… right? I can even just add it to there. Maybe I still want to work it. I could just add it to there so that, you know, other people, you know, that I'm working it.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  But they have visibility. I like it should I close it. And then.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  there's the team view, this allows you to see all the open emails across the team. Okay, right? So I can see we have 25 emails that still need to get done in our support help app. I can see who's working on those emails. I can also see which ones are late. So you can set up custom slas for certain types of emails where it's like, okay, this is a high priority email. This needs to get responded to within two hours. And if it's not, we want to be notified that it's late. We also have AI sentiment analysis which just lets you know the sentiment of the email, right? So we know that this one's late and this person's unhappy. So maybe you want to prioritize that one. Yeah. And then also, the great thing is let's just say somebody's out, right? Let's just say Cole's out today. I can just click on Cole's name. I can see all the emails that he has. I can see the back and forwards he's had. I can see the changes. I can respond to it. I can close it out for him or I can just take his stuff and just assign them to somebody else on the team.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Nice. I like that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But yeah, this is just to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. You can see what everybody on the team is working on. Awesome. And then are you guys using Salesforce or Hubspot by chance?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  We use Hubspot. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Hubspot. Okay, great. So we have a direct integration with Hubspot. So if an email comes in and that email is already in Hubspot… it can show you like if there's a deal, the deal card and everything. Yeah, deal card, contact card, company info, exactly. Awesome.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I love that. I was definitely going to ask if you guys had an integration,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then we also have with other project management tools as well. I don't know if you use like Monday or clickup or anything like that.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  We use clickup as well. Okay, great. Let.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Me just go here. This will be easier.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So here's a list of the apps that we have. So we have Hubspot, we have clickup. Nice. Yeah, awesome.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Yeah. We also use Jira, we have used others in the past as well. So, okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. Yeah. And with some of the integrations, you can create a Jira issue directly here from hiver as well. And you can also create tasks to clickup directly from hiver as well. Perfect. I'm sorry?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then to your other question there. So we also have reporting. And while that's loading there's, also one more thing I wanted to show, you can also create a knowledge base with hiver as well. Okay. Yeah. So you can.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Yeah, that's definitely a huge initiative for us this year.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Yeah, you can create a knowledge base which is searchable, right? Any types of articles, et cetera. And then another thing that hiver comes with hiver also comes with chat as well. So you can do chat that will go directly into hiver. It'll be just below the email section here. And yeah, you can assign the chat to each other, et cetera.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Lovely.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let's go to analytics. So with analytics, you select the address that you want to see, you select the timeframe, right? It could be last month, last 90 days. I'll just do last 90 days. So it has more info and you're going to be able to see like as you ask like, okay, so for that timeframe, how many new emails did we get? How many emails did we close out? Yeah, right. And you can analyze any of these views. You can slice and dice it however you want. You could group it by person by tag by custom fields. You can save these different views. You're going to be able to see the workload across the team. So, you know, in the past month, we assigned, you know, 80 emails to Rakesh, and about 60 emails to matt. The people sent out this many emails. It's also going to show the performance of each person. So how long does it take them to respond to emails? How long is it taking them to resolve emails? We can also include customer satisfaction surveys that go out on the bottom of the emails as well.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I love that. I love a good csat score,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then with the tags, you can look back and say, okay, last month, we got 100 emails about billing questions or in the past month, they, you know, we got 25 cancellation requests. So you can also just kind of track what types of emails you're getting it's. Also going to track the companies and contacts that reached out. So, you know, our Amazon customer reached out, you know, 100 times last month, etc… with the slas, you can track things like how many times they were violated, right? So, those high priority emails that we want to be responded within two hours, we violated at 65 times last month and, you know, these were the people that did it. These are the emails etc.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Csat reporting?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Sentiment analysis reporting. So you can see things like, you know, what was the average sentiment for the last month of the emails that we were getting? And then we have some like more custom AI reporting as well. You can build custom reports. This is all exportable to a CSV file. You can have it sent to you. You can choose which features you want. I mean, which fields you want to see. And there's also custom dashboards. Okay. Yeah. And that's pretty much it as far as the product goes. Any other questions? Thoughts, things that you were hoping it had? No, this.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Is pretty straightforward. It seems like you're kind of taking a bunch of pieces of other programs that work well and meshing them all into one. I really like that you can take a personal email and throw it into a group setting.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Love that. Is there?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Does each person that is included in your groups have to have access to the generic email? Does each person that's included? Like does each one, everybody have to be logged in to help that? No?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No. So that's the beauty of hiver, is that once you connected to hiver, nobody has to access that email anymore?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Lovely. Perfect. That is such a roadblock for us. So I love that. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So, yeah, once it's connected to hiver, logging into that help, you know, obviously, maybe you or somebody else will need to log in. But yeah, the whole point about hiver is no longer having, to log into a separate email?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I love it. You said there was automations that will automatically assign a CSM to an email if it comes in. Is there, are there also automations for like the company? Like tagging it immediately or something. I know there's you know, the email URL, but just for organization? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So our, so another big thing about hiver is that we have probably the most robust automation system like we bring people over from Zendesk, quite large companies specifically for our automations just because we have so many options. But yeah, you, so basically, you choose like the trigger point and just to keep it simple like when a new conversation is received here, if conditions, so a lot of different options here. So like what was your scenario again? You mentioned like if it's.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  from a certain client? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So like if it's from a certain domain or client, you can put their email or domain. I'll just do domain. So, you know, if it's Amazon com… then we wanted to automatically add urgent… or whatever, yeah, whatever tag you have set up. So, yeah. So whenever somebody comes in from Amazon com, it's going to automatically apply that tag. And then, you know, as you can imagine, you can add to this list quite extensively. We also wanted to update the status. You know, we also want to send an automatic reply to this customer. So you can have a lot of different action points based on domains, emails, et cetera.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I love the setting up an auto reply as well. That would be very useful. Yeah. Then all you.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  need to do is hit save and that's it. So it's quite easy to set up easy to make changes to it, right? As as needed.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Can every user set up their own automations or is that set up at a team level?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So you do have to be, you choose the permission levels of people and you do have to be an admin to have access to the backend. So as long as someone's an admin, then they can go into this backend here and make it. But yeah, they would have to be an admin, which is, I mean, you can add, you can decide to add everybody as an admin, or maybe just a few people totally up to you. Awesome. Yeah, cause there's a different permission roles when you add people to the account.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Right. Oh, this is great. Yeah. And the other?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Huge thing too especially, you know, as a, you know, probably as a little bit of a smaller team that's it, that would be getting started, right?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  We have.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  24 seven support chat directly in your account, goes to a real human here at hiver. They can hop on the phone with you as well, right? Like if you were having an issue like you literally like you can talk to somebody within a minute. So people are super impressed with our support, you know, especially where the smaller companies, right? Smaller companies, they go to these larger companies and sign up and it can take days for them to hear back from support. And with hiver, you can literally talk to somebody in minutes. So there's that. And then I'll email everything to you. Our pricing is online as well. We also offer a free seven day trial. Okay? So you could even test it out for seven days if you wanted to. We have an annual subscription, which, you know, you can save some money for paying for the year upfront when we also have a month to month option as well.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Awesome. No, this is great. Definitely send me over the information. Are you going to send this recording over as well?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can do that as well that.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Would be great. I want to show her share it with my lead of growth as well, cause I think that she would definitely want to see this also. Great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, I can share all this to you. And then as far as next steps go here, what makes the most sense for you? Yeah.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I mean, I want to touch base with my CEO and my head of growth and just see where both of them are at. As far as next steps, I don't know if maybe head of growth would also want to take a call with you in order to get a quick demo, but I'll kind of check in with them and get their pulse check today. Okay? Great. Awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So… yeah. So I'll email everything to you and you're are you saying that you might let me know like this week as far as next steps go? Yeah.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  I'll try to, I'll definitely try to connect with them and get you something within the next couple of days. Definitely don't want to keep you hanging either way. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Cool. Yeah. And yeah, like you said, if it makes sense, we could schedule another like 30 minute demo for them, which would probably make the most sense. So, yeah, just let me know that then we can figure out the availability via email.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Definitely. Yeah. If you haven't heard from me by Friday, definitely hit me up. It's not because I don't care. I promise.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, awesome. Erin. Well, hey, really appreciate the time we'll go via email here and you came from our auto campaign too as well or I?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Believe that's where she was found. I'm not sure how Chelsea connected with you guys.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I'll figure it out here.

Shanket Yadav (shanket.y@grexit.com):
  They came through the gift card campaign.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Actually, okay, perfect. That's what I was, that's what I thought. So, yeah, we'll also make sure that the gift card gets sent to you as well, awesome.

Shanket Yadav (shanket.y@grexit.com):
  That sounds great. So, just want to clarify that, Erin, do we have to send it to you or your CEO? Because I think we got a, the platform CEO, don't know where we should send it actually?

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Oh, just send it to Chelsea. Okay. Yeah, got it. No worries.

Shanket Yadav (shanket.y@grexit.com):
  Thanks for clarifying.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Of course.

Shanket Yadav (shanket.y@grexit.com):
  Thank you. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Much shanket. Do we have Chelsea's email too? Yeah?

Shanket Yadav (shanket.y@grexit.com):
  We do have. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Well, yeah, thanks again. Erin. Have a great day, of course.

Erin Whitchurch (erin@viralmoment.com):
  Have a good one. Bye bye.
