================================================================================

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Jeevan.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Hi, uttar. I just made you host. I also did switch, the co, host over, so you should be able to, whenever I schedule a meeting, you might get an email and stuff. You can ignore those meetings, but ideally, you should just be able to start my zoom.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Maybe because this was already created, it wasn't happening. But next time onwards, you should be able to start my zoom.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cool. I'll check the next.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Time anyway, I'll be around for all of these scenarios. But the only reason is because chilli, piper sends only the original zoom link to the customer. Sometimes they join the older ones. So it creates.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  a, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that is true.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it creates a little bit of a thing. So that's why I thought we'll maintain this, but yeah, should be fine.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Sounds.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Good. Okay. Let me know how this goes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Alright. Bye.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We'll chat soon. Bye.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, matt. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you hear me? Yes?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Can you hear me?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Now, I can hear you. Yes. How are you?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  I'm well, how are you doing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you, great. Matt. Thank you so much for scheduling this with us. My name is Yukta and I'll be helping you with the evaluation.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So before anything, I would first want to understand a bit in terms of what made you look out for hiver, what is it that you're currently looking for? So that I can accordingly data the demonstration for you?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay. So we're looking for a very specific use case. So we have, we're a summer day camp. So for two months out of the year, for eight weeks, we transport about a 1,000 kids to and from our summer camp every single day. And we have a transportation department, six people in that department. And we get a lot of a lot of just parent concerns and parent conversations, and they come in through the phone through email through other ways. And what we're seeing is that the volume of incoming customer support requests is overwhelming our current system, which is not really a system at all. So things are slipping through the cracks and what we want to be able to do is have one central location for all of our customer support to go into. And then for us to be able to see at the end of the day, what is still unresolved what's been resolved? And just like I guess sort of a dashboard view of what's going on so that nothing falls through the cracks. We have to get back to every parent every single day.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. I think that sounds perfect. So how are these people today handling all these communication and what channels you mentioned? Is it primarily through email or there are other channels?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Email and phone? And then occasionally we have like a face to face situation. So someone is verbally saying something to somebody else and it gets passed along and then it gets sent to the transportation department. And the way that it's being handled, there's no software system that manages and prioritizes these requests… or these issues. So it's very much just human centered. And just the volume is overwhelming that ad hoc system.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, out of these three channels, like which one is the most common, like when you receive most of the queries?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  I would say that phone and email are probably equal. And between the two of them, we receive like 95 percent through them, but I think they're pretty equal.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. And like do you have any generic email address at which people write to reach out to the transport team? Like do you have a generic email?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  We do, but sometimes they're also reaching out to other email addresses as well. But we have a generic email address that's supposed to handle all of those queries.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So for now, the team is sort of logging into the same Gmail account and then picking those emails up and working on them. Is that how it is?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. I think there was, could you hear me? Yes. Okay. Got it. And how many people do we have in total who are responsible for this specific part of the business?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Well, there's six people in that department. And then there's a couple of people that would also probably want to have access to see how things are going sort of oversight. Overall. In our organization, we have about 60 different email addresses that potentially people could be emailing things to even though they're not part of that department. So oftentimes, if they email one of those other email addresses, that person will forward it to the transportation email address.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood that's.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  what's supposed to happen?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah, I mean, I think as I can understand the process today is super manual in terms of handling these inquiries through different channels. So, I'm sure you know, having something more streamlined could actually work for you so that nothing is missed and we are responding to each inquiry on time. So, have you ever tried any other platform in the past or is this the first time that you're looking out to sort of?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  This is, this is the first time we're looking into something like this?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And in terms of the phone, you said, so, do you have like a landline number or is it like you have a specific phone number that your team is, sort of, how is it taken care of? Like in terms of the phone connects?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  We have one phone number, one main phone number, and we have an office staff of about 20, and any of those people could pick up the phone and deal with the, take the issue or forward the issue to someone in the transportation department. So we don't have a dedicated phone line just for the transportation department.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Understood. I think this makes sense. So do you have any calling provider? No, right. It's like a normal phone call, that phone that anybody picks up in the office, whoever is available?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Right. Anyone is available. We use it's a voip system. It's verizon onetalk. I don't know, if that matters, but it's verizon's voip system.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. No problem. Perfect. I think this makes sense. Thank you for sharing the information. I think it helps understanding in terms of what you're doing now. So to just give you a quick introduction, matt, firstly, can you see my screen? Yes, you can. Perfect. So just to give you a quick introduction of, hiver integrates right within your Gmail. So the team does not have to use a separate platform in order to handle all the emails or phone calls that are coming to these, to this department. Now, I'm assuming that everybody who would want to be part of hiver, they have their own Gmail accounts, right? With the company domain.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Correct. Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  They do perfect. So from here, what I've done, I've logged into my respective Gmail account. I have hiver embedded within my Gmail itself as you can see in these yellow colored icons. Now from here, you could handle your personal email as you're doing today. And at the same time, we will be creating a shared inbox that will be connected with your transport generic email address where you're receiving most of your emails on a day to day basis. And from here, we will add all six to 10 people whoever needs to be part of this inbox. And then it becomes a lot streamlined in terms of you'll have all your emails coming in one designated place, which is your an assigned section. And from here, you would know that, you know, from this activity panel who this needs to go to. So let's say if I want to assign this to myself, it's already in my name. Okay? So this is a different inbox. Okay? So if I want to just assign this to myself, I can do it. And once you give the ownership, that step is going to be recorded in this activity section right here. So anything that we do in regards to any email, everything gets recorded. And this email, now that I have assigned this to myself will come into my mind section so that I know, okay, these are the emails that I'm responsible for and chances that we would now miss out on the emails will go really will go really down because now, you know that, okay, these are the ones that I'm responsible for the team transparency. We still have the visibility onto each other work. So under team section, as you can see, we have all these emails and we know at all times who is working on what. So for example, if my colleague is out of office, I can easily go firstly see what these emails are about. If I want to assign this to myself, I can do it from here or I just go and bulk select all these and just reassign those to myself so that I can pick these up, right? So that's how we make sure that nothing slips through the crack. We are on top of these emails at all times as a supervisor or a manager, you could easily go here, get a quick workload distribution in terms of understanding how much each one has in their radar at a time, how many open emails they're currently working on. So, and if you need to go into individual workflow, you can do that as well. And look at all the open tickets that each person has at a moment. Any questions so far? Like just taking a quick pause?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  If you assign someone an email, do they get a notification? Do they get, is it like they get a new email in their inbox?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So anything that's assigned to them, they'll come into the mind section of there. So they know that, okay, these are the emails that are assigned to me and I need to pick these. They will also be notified through this bell icon whenever a new email gets assigned to them.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Now, in terms of working on these emails, so while I'm replying here, I can actually use a couple of things here as well, right? So we can use email templates to templatize our response, have a standard response to these inquiries so that we are more efficient and faster in terms of our responses, you could connect with your colleague. You can have internal conversation going on here as well. So, for example, I have written this response here, but it's not complete. I just saved this as a draft for now. So it's going to be visible to everyone who's part of this inbox. And I can add mention anyone, let's say my manager to just discuss anything that would help me sort of close this. And we both can converse, Aditya will receive a notification in this bell icon. Again, he can start following this email as well by clicking on this I button so that it starts coming into this section of following. So that he knows that he's not the ultimate assigner here or the assignee but he is involved here and he can at all times see the progress on this one, right? So this would be, yeah.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  I'm sorry. So like if I start following this a thread, does the person who's in charge of that thread, know that I'm following it? No?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no, they don't know. Okay. Yeah. So you can follow any email that you're interested in or you would want to keep an eye on. So this is something that you could do. And then of course, once I'm done with this, I know my final response, I just send this out and I can mark this email as closed so that I know that I have already worked on it. It's no longer going to be in my section here and it will go under all views and will be sitting in the closed ones wherein you would be able to see all your closed emails that the team has already worked on. So any response if comes on these emails that will come back into the mind section for the person to pick up again. So that we don't have to at all times sort of keep an eye on these sections here. So this would be the workflow. And of course, with this, you could also create these tags to sort of bifurcate your emails into different categories from the managerial perspective or from the leadership perspective. You could go under analytics to see certain metrics or different reports, choosing the time that you're interested in. So you could see the workload distribution and handling time for each user specifically as to how the workload distribution looks like for each one, how they have been responding to these emails. So all of this is available in terms of the analytics or stats that you would be interested to look at as well. Anything in specific that you would want me to sort of help you with understanding in terms of the analytics.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  So what I'm interested in seeing as a supervisor of these people is which issues are open and for how long they've been open?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So although open, so the ones that are currently open, right? So for that, you don't really have to go into analytics. That is something that you would anyway be able to see here. So under team section. So all these three sections will give you the understanding of all the open emails itself. So at all times, you know that there are 16 open emails that we currently have, how long they have been open for you could go into the, you know, into the details of it here and can actually see, you know, how long has it been open? And just sitting in open, when was the first email that came in, right? So this is something that you could do. So from here itself, you can get that understanding, you know, live under analytics. Now here, you would be able to see from the conversation perspective, how many active conversations we currently have, how many new have we have received and how many we have resolved? So this is something that you could see from here, you can further analyze it as well in terms of the open conversations that we currently have. When was it created, who is the assignee and what's the status? So this is something that you could fetch from here. But I think, you know, for what you were mentioning, I think you don't even have to go to analytics for that. You can easily get that view from the team section.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  So sometimes an issue is resolved through a phone call. So how would we, how would we identify that?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So for phone, we have the phone connect here as well. But the prerequisite for you to connect your phone is going to be that we only connect with Aircall as the calling provider. So Aircall is the tool that you could potentially use in order to handle all the calls or incoming calls. And hiver integrates with Aircall, which helps you to pick and receive calls within your Gmail itself. And you can log those calls here, any actionable from the call that I speak with someone. And as a follow up, I need to send them an email. Then I can just compose it right from here itself. And I don't have to go anywhere else in terms of any data or analytics from the phone front that wouldn't be there, but it will help you sort of be able to handle these calls right within here while you're working on the shared mailbox.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay. So if let's say we don't integrate with Aircall, but somebody from our team picks up the phone and calls a parent and resolves the issue. Do they then go back into that email and just mark it as completed?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So, let's say if there is an open ticket and it's with the same person, and instead of replying here, they just directly call them. And if it's resolved on phone itself, they come here and they just close this ticket and that's it or they could just update the note as well as to what happened or spoke with the customer on call and whatever that needs to be written here.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay. And then, is there a way to automatically add an email address to the BCC field when you're sending an email or is that, I don't expect you to have that feature? I'm just curious.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Could you elaborate, I mean, who you would want to keep in BCC at all for all emails?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  So, we BCC a zapier email address, and that logs all outgoing emails into our CRM. So that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Will happen anyway, right? Is it already happening for you? Like do you already have that setting in your Gmail?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  No, we don't people have to do it manually.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I think that would be a Gmail setting more than like anything to do with hiver because within Gmail, you'll have to integrate zapier and keep it in BCC. So currently, like we are integrated with Hubspot in our Gmail. So everything, you know, in the BCC, we always have Hubspot, so that everything gets recorded in our CRM. So likewise, I think which CRM are you using or where you would want to log these outgoing emails?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  It's a custom CRM. Okay? So we, it's a custom… built CRM. So we would just, we just want this a specific email address to be in the BCC field… but it's okay. We do it manually. Now. I was just wondering if it could make it easier.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And I'm also thinking like even if you would want to do it like it could only happen through Gmail, is what I believe because putting that address in BCC has to do with something in Gmail settings itself that you make it as default within this account within this Gmail account. So that all emails get, have you ever tried that yourself?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  No, no, no. I haven't tried figuring out how to do it automatically. I don't think you can.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  That's okay. So I guess, my other question is there there's obviously, there are a few competitors in the, in this space, what would you say is the biggest differentiator between like let's say Freshdesk and front and hiver, like, what is it that's different about hiver potentially better?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think that's a great question and I agree that there are so many, you know, so many tools out there in the market who are almost doing the same thing. I think it all boils down to the specific needs that you have because each platform is, you know, sort of giving functionalities or features that you may or may not require. So, I think there is, I wouldn't have an answer to as per how hiver is better. But if it caters to what you are looking for, which is a simplified way of handling tickets, not making it super clunky or complicated and having something which resides within your Gmail, that is something which a lot of customers do enjoy. And of course, the support that comes in whether you know, you have someone to rely on at all times, whenever you have certain queries. These are some things that our customers have spoken a lot about and they have been enjoying these parts of hiver. But again front has its own interface and it works on that. It's a standalone platform. They are doing maybe a little different things than what we are doing. So, yeah, I think it all boils down to if the tool makes sense to you and if this is something that you resonate with depending upon that, I think you would be able to make a decision like phone? I'm not sure how you would like that. I mean, is that something that you absolutely would want or just handling email is also enough for you at this point?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  I don't think we're going to change our phone system right now. So I think that whatever system we use on our end, we're going to have to figure out a way to take the incoming phone calls and turn them into emails so that we can track them. So perhaps it's just somebody who takes a phone call, writing up a note and then emailing it to that transportation email address. We would.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  want the transcript to be sent on this email address.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Well, it doesn't have to be a transcript. I suppose I don't think we're going to be able to do a transcript of the phone call. I think the person who's answering the phone has to write up a description of the phone call and then funnel it into this system by sending an email to the transportation.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think that is something that you would still do. So whenever someone is, I mean that would still remain as a manual process, right? For someone to first they receive a call. They, and when they're sending an email, they can just simply write at this transportation email address and it'll anyway, come into your shared mailbox for the team to then pick up and then just start working on it. So I think that wouldn't change anything in terms of how you're handling your phone calls. So that is something you could still do without connecting it, connecting your phone with hiver or any tool for that matter.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Right. Okay. And I see a lot of tags at the top there on this thread. What do those tags mean?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So these tags are like by hiver. So these are going to be there by default, like there would be less or more depending upon the email. So these are the labels that sort of, you know, hiver configures through and picks your email from the original inbox and give you the view here. So that's why these labels are going to be required. And these are like just going to be there and not going to really hinder on your day to day workflow and you cannot even delete it. So there is nothing to worry about.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay. And then in the Gmail app on your phone, are all these folders and tags in that app?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We have a Gmail application. We have a mobile application for hiver for Gmail wherein you would be able to handle or have the inbox, what labels are you talking about in the phone? These labels?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  No, I see on like under support, it says unassigned mine.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. We have a mobile application. So you will see all the functionalities that you're seeing here in the browser. So you can manage your inbox through phone as well.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay. So the members of that team download the hiver app, yeah. And they can, okay, got it. All right. And then, okay. And then I guess my last question is just pricing.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  We would do a monthly since we're a seasonal business. We would only do it monthly. What's the pricing per user?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I think we have different plans here for monthly… based on the functionalities that you do require. I think you could pick a specific plan, but I think based on our discussion, I think growth plan should suffice for you as you start. So we sell in a bucket of five. So it starts with minimum two users and then it go to 510 15. So for your team of up to like six to eight users, we'll be looking at the bucket of 10. So it's going to cost you 35 dollars per user per month.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And this will have almost everything that we just discussed from the analytics to, you know, having the ability to assign emails, create tags, have templates and use some automations as well to automate certain workflows, right? So, for example, you could also do this if, you know, if in the phone, like specifically, if you have let's say eight people who are part of this inbox here and out of those eight people, if anybody receives a call or picks a call, and if they want to write an email to go into the shared mailbox, you can set up this automation that, you know, any email that's been written from Yukta, it should get automatically assigned to her. So that we know that, okay, I only wrote this email to have this in the shared mailbox. And since I already spoke with that person, I can just pick this email up and can you know, action on it? So that is something you could do as an automation. But for anybody else who is sort of writing emails across those 20 people, whoever is receiving, you could create a separate tag for that for all the telephone connects or all the phone connects. So that you always have that separate view. When you're you know, that these are the emails which have come through phone and not directly to the inbox. So likewise, you can set up different automations to make this more streamlined and more scalable as well for the team. Does it make sense?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Yes. And can anybody of the six to eight people manage the shared inbox, or is it just one particular inbox that then is the manager?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no. Everybody would have access to everything here.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay. Got it. So there's no like admin?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  There is admin. Of course, there are different roles. There is admin. There is supervisor, admin would have the access to the admin panel, create these automations, workflows that they want to do. This is something that not everybody would have access to. And then through analytics. Also if somebody is a supervisor, they might not be able to go into admin panel, but they have the access to the analytics to see what's happening for a team member or an agent who is just responsible to work on these emails, they would just have access to everything here in this inbox and they can work out of the inbox itself, assign reassign change status, create tag like apply tags and all of that. So there are different roles, of course, but primarily everybody would have access to everything within the shared mailbox to make changes.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Okay. And then my last question is if we had within our organization, if we had multiple… shared inboxes, so we had our transportation team and then we had a different team, would that all count under one license… bucket type of thing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So each plan has its own set of shared mailboxes that it can accommodate. So if you see in the growth plan, you can create up to three shared mailboxes. So it allows you to have up to three. And then you are charged on the per user, right? So you can have three inboxes and you can have about 20 users who are part of across these three. There could be overlaps as well. It doesn't matter. So that's how you would be able to then accommodate in each plan pro has five shared mailboxes. And then when you go to elite, anything more than five is accommodated here.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay. So for 350 dollars a month, we can get 10 users and up to three shared mailboxes that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is correct. Yes.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Are you looking at multiple shared mailboxes or just one to start with?

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  One main one, but if… it goes well, I could see potentially other people wanting it.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  So it's good to have up to three. So especially because we're not going to need all 10 users for the transportation use case. So if we have three or four extra licenses, we might make more. But, okay. All right. So I think… I like this because it lives in Gmail and it's very easy to use if you know, how to use Gmail… if we wanted to do like a more detailed demo for a few members of the team, could I set that up through you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. If you want. I would want to set it up right now. If we could have a follow up meeting, even tentative would work for now and we can always change it or modify it if there are any changes from your side. So who all you would want to invite for this detailed demo? Matt, I.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  would want to invite our transportation director. His name is Michael. Okay? And I just, I don't have his calendar right now. Okay? So this would have to be next week. Okay? So, can I email you and get back to you? This is not, this is not something we're going to forget to do. This is important. So I don't want you to… I know you want to get something on the calendar and I understand why, but, we're not going to, this is important to us very much. So, let me get back to you, with a date and a time or a couple of dates and times for you to choose from because he's going to be the one using this and I want to make sure, that he's on board and comfortable with it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. I think that makes sense. So you could let me know. I'll also share my calendar link on the email so that you can directly book it as for the availability checking with everyone internally. And then we can schedule this for next week and if everybody likes it, then we can then accordingly help you with the trial as well and then take it forward from there.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Perfect. Okay. Thank you so much for your time. Thank.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You so much. Take care. Bye.

Matthew Kaufman (mkaufman@campramaquois.com):
  Bye bye.
