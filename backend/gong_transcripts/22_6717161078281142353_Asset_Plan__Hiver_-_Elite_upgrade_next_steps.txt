================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  it's been going good. Both me and Pavitra looks like we're at different stages of recovering from different types of flu. I've got the coughs. She's got a really bad throat. Honestly, I don't think she can speak much. I'm.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  sorry, I hope you guys recover fast. Hey, I just wanted.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  to say.

Pavithra Sundar (pavithra.s@grexit.com):
  Yes, thank you, Fernando. I'm still recovering. I've been talking the whole day, so I'm starting to lose the balanced voice that I have. So I'm going to stay mute. I'm going to let Raghav take lead today. I will come in the implementation part with Naomi and roboto mostly.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  Perfect. Don't worry, don't worry. I hope you recover… all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. That's great to hear Fernando. So, yeah, so quickly jumping to the agenda of today's, call, primary discussion was pricing. You've mentioned that 45 seems to be the current rate that you're looking at. Yeah, the context that I wanted to give you, Fernando, heading into the call was that basically, you know, from the hybrid side of it, we did give the team a heads up that, you know, the price would increase but we'd get you a discounted price and a discounted offering. So all said and done, the first thing I wanted to clarify was even at this stage, it does seem like based on the email, at least you're leaning more towards a monthly contract and the prices and the incentives that I've gotten approval for was more from an annual contract perspective. So what I wanted to ask you was would you be open to signing an annual contract but a monthly payment schedule? Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  Yeah, we're open to that. Actually, we would prefer a monthly month to month contract, but we understand that you guys have your way of working internally and want to have your customers side to our contracts.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  So we're open to that exactly. But yeah, we would expect a discount in case we do that. And the other thing we were discussing on the email, I think it's like… we have a lot of hiver before you guys change your pricing. And now, I think all your plans include the AI features and they are obviously increasing in price and we're really happy with the tool. Actually, we're enjoying the tool. It's been really useful for the team, but we don't have the budget to pay like the new prices you guys have in your website. Yeah, I think you guys already know this, but.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm aware of this. Yeah. So like Fernando, apologies, if it sounds like I'm or seems like I'm cutting you off, what I did want to put forth in front of you was that the new tier along with AI that we're talking. So there's two angles that I'm looking at for the renewal and the upgrade for your team, right? Primarily, the first one is that AI is relatively new. It was kind of like, you know, what? You can check it out explore it while you signed up back in November, October and November. But essentially, you know, like you said, it's part of the tiers right now, but it's not just AI that we've included into the tiers as part of the migration, the revamp and the increase in cost. As a result of it. We've also increased like limits on specific functionality individually across the board alongside more on the regular hiver non AI hiver as well that we brought into the picture, right? So all of that to basically say that while the team so far hasn't used AI, I understand, you know, it's been two months on hiver. It might be a little early for you to think about. Hey, is AI even meaningful? Just going by my last two discussions or me and Pavitra's last two discussions with Naomi, we do see a path where AI will add value in the sense of justifying. Hey, this is why we upgraded early in the sense of an upgrade with an incentivized cost and included AI in terms of the whole cost. Now we're happy to sort of partner with you, make sure we've got the right material, the right numbers and the right kind of data that you can forecast down the line with your leadership. So all right. This is why, you know, the kind of cost per user on hiver is validated now, with that said after your last email about a 45 is the price point that you're looking at. We did have a follow up discussion with leadership obviously, right? So what I wanted to check with you is your openness to meeting us a little more in the middle because quite honestly, 45 is a little too low especially considering the fact that we set the right expectations. We've notified the team about the increase and that's when we kicked off the trial. So is there any wiggle room on your end? Because we did get an approval from our leadership in terms of wiggle room. So if you're good at 55 usd per person instead of 45. So that's 10 dollars more per person in terms of what you had mentioned on the email as a proof cost for a team of 35, it's a 350 dollar increase over what you have projected on expected prices. So if you're good with 55, we've already got an approval for 55 per user per month, good to go on price, one year contract payment monthly per person with everything hiver has to offer because you're literally going to the highest tier. Yeah. And just for context, that's almost half price of, what the advertised rates are for the plan that you're going to go to. Yeah?

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  Sounds good. But just to be completely fine with you, huh. Thank you for the offer. It sounds really great. The thing is we finished last week created this year budget and we set some money or set some budget for that. Excuse me, what we call like the tool we're going to use for email tracking and ticket management for the account management team. And we actually set something below 45… already good enough. Who want to increase that amount. Nothing is impossible. But, but for 55 that we need to go to and do that, the full road trip and go to with finance and discuss, where we are going to take this money, how we're going to allocate this expense and make that and say, no, no, but.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Compared to 63 is reasonable. But you've got some leg room to cover internally is what I'm hearing? Yeah.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, right. Got it. But just to one thing like definitely, they're gonna ask special finance to negotiate that base price that 55, but I understand, that already has a discount. They're gonna obviously push to negotiate.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And what?

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  We went up? What I want to avoid is like, we work with a company. I forgot the name, but, let me tell you in case you guys know them.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, please. I.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  I don't I forgot the name but it's a company that negotiates sas vendors on our behalf and I would love to avoid, I would love to avoid to, for them to get it getting like get on board with this negotiation because it's gonna make it longer. And in case I don't, I go to plan and say like, okay, I need to screen the increase the budget, this amount again. They're gonna, they're gonna say, okay, but make these guys negotiate for us. That's the reason we're paying them, right? So, so, okay, I understand. I said all these stuff just to make sure that's your best offer. Of course, many of the offers you guys make made us or makes make us, that the pathway to fall is gonna be different slower, faster, right? Of course. Well, that's enough.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. So.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  They'll offer. I'll do my best, to keep using you guys because you keep using yourself because I think it's really good but it's gonna make it make it's gonna go, go lost and awesome. I mean, you guys and us go through, a not so fast process so that's the thing.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, definitely. And, you know, to your point of hey, is this the best and final offer hybrid can provide? You know, I've already gone up all the way to our chief sales officer in terms of getting the approval, I went through our team lead for success. Then I went to the senior vice president of customer success. And then I hit up the chief sales officers, the final round of approvals, which is why I was able to get that down from 105 to 63 to now 55 as like the final offering that's realistically possible given everything you get with the software.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Now with the upgrade, right? Because you're again literally on the top most here. But with that said, you know, I hear where you're coming from, right? And especially in like the south American market with software vendors. I'm sure you're talking about like a partner or reseller that pretty much takes care of things like that in terms of.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  organization, it's like a startup tech company like I'm the company that like aggregates like.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Is it spendflow or record club or any of those? No?

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  No, it's not okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Cool. All right.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  Later, I don't know we have a slack channel with them, but I can find it by now just to give you one more argument to see Raghav, if you can get us a better deal than the 55.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  We have an annual contract with send desk because we use send this for another operational unit, of course, that serves the tenants. We're we're probably, so we serve the owners and the tenants and,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  today.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  60 dollars per user in send desk, and we are in the highest tier as well. I know six is more than 55, but,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  no, but I, we.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  have a full set of features in send desk AI already implemented there. We have the knowledge base there as well. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  God.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  Going so close to 60 is gonna bring another conversation to the table. It's like 100 percent. Why are you guys not using send? This? We had good arguments for that when we were like around 40.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Because I.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  don't want to use Zendesk for this team.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that makes sense.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  It's going to put that conversation on the table. These are 35 extra users you can use to negotiate with Zendesk because I can show you the contract. I'm not lying here. Our contract with Zendesk is going to renew on March 30 first. So it's going to.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We're in the.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  perfect position to renegotiate with them. If we bring three or four more users to the table, I don't know, take them down to 60 dollars down to 58. I don't know so again.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, I hear where you're coming from, Fernando. Basically… I'm sorry, go ahead, no.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  No, go ahead. Go ahead. That was my point.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, I was just going to say, you know, if you go back to Zendesk and you're already at 60, how many people do you have on?

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  With Zendesk, we have like 65 users more.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Or less got it. So 65 and 35, you're going to look at the 9,000 dollar cap. I mean, 9,000 user cap. You're already at 60, they're probably going to drop it two or three dollars in that sense of it, which means when you want to validate the hiver cost, alright, all of that makes sense. I'm also taking into consideration that if it does come down to it, you're also going to be vocal about why you're not on Zendesk or why you're not choosing it. But at the same time, you know, I understand that as a business, it does come down to bottom line commercials at the end of the day. Quick question. Though with your Zendesk renewal coming up at the end of March, long term, you know, if we do make pricing a bit more conducive than 55 and we'll make it, you know, we're able to get it approved and get it over the line. Do you think there might be a potential down the line for any of those 60 people to sort of consider hiver? Would you be open to making an introduction, maybe six months down the line or something like that? Yeah, definitely. Before next year's renewal. Yeah, we're.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  always open to business, being realistic. I don't think it happened right now before March. No, it's a bit like we don't have that much time, but happy to keep discussing that scenario… down the line. As you said, of course.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Makes sense. All right. No, that's sufficient at least for me at this point, Fernando, you know, to your point, you've been in the business. I'm sure you understand how these kind of discussions work at companies. So as it stands right now, the final approval I've got from our chief sales officer is 55 per user and that's purely from, you know, the new cost… the relationship and the kind of agreement we've had so far, we might have had a bit in the bedroom if you were already in an ambulance and were pursuing an upgrade. But let me go on. Let me go ahead and make one more pass with the leadership. And before the end of the day, I do have a one on one with the chief sales officer later today. So I'm going to make one more case, see even if it's one or two dollars more. I'm going to have a discussion, try to shave that off, put it in an order, form, send it over. And then that way would be, do you think five sixth on renewal is realistic for us to aim for? Just to have the contract approved and things like that any lower than 55? Do you think it makes sense?

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  You've got to be a little bit interactive. But yeah, if I got everything you said, it makes sense, try your best and send us your best offer. If it is 55, stay at 55. I don't understand. I'll do my thing internally. If you, if you can't improve, that will help me a lot.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  100 percent, yeah.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  And could make things faster. Sorry. So, yeah, I work for email for sure. I know you said at the beginning, I totally buy the point that you guys integrated AI into one full package if the possibility to.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  At least for.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  now we can discuss that later. And I'm really open to that. But if you can decrease the price significantly, pointing off AI, leaving everything else open. We could like break this conversation in two sections, like we can move really fast right now and sign the annual contract. And in three months for now, we can discuss about upgrading AI. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Pricing.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  about that, like compartmentalize it, right? Like, okay, and it would help me to sell that argument or sell that hypothesis to leadership or to manage to finance actually not leadership but to finance like in a single sales pitch way. And like, okay, we want AI because this is what I'm gonna accomplish and this is going to increase productivity in X y Z. I don't know that makes sense. See if you can help us with that. That will help us a lot.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  To move. No, definitely, Fernando, definitely, no. I've already had the conversation about he, can we bifurcate remove exclude AI and that's how, you know, we ended up as a business at 63 and now at 55 as the final price. But to your point, right? Considering I'm anyways, going back to leadership and having another pause at it. I'll see if there's any additional wiggle room I can bring to the table for you and appreciate you saying you're open to compartmentalizing it and maybe pursuing two or three months down the line. Obviously, this would be part of the contract. If we are able to do it. I don't want to give you the wrong expectation and come back and be like, hey, we can't do it right? But I am going to try for both, one is without AI or without immediately paying for AI. What's the best price we can get you that's lower than 55 with AI included?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Is there even a possibility of a price less than 55? So I'm going to pursue both those conversations. I'm meeting with my sales officer in like 45 minutes. So about an hour and a half from now, expect an email from me with an order form and hopefully fingers crossed. We're able to get this over the line before renewal and it's more sailing and we get your team continuously using and adopting the functionality and we go from there. Brilliant. All right, Fernando. Thank you so much for popping on the call and for being transparent with us all this while. I'm happy.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  Where are you guys based?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It's been a pleasure. Oh, we're both based out of India. We're working with a city called Chennai down south by the coast. Yeah. I.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  was curious because your accent is you don't have a so strong in your accent you haven't read it for an accent?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm just messing with you, man. I've been doing this for like 10 years. So excuse me. Nice.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  Cool. I went for your email.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, but, yeah, I was just going to say I've ended up rolling my R'S more than I would typically, but pleasure talking to you again, Fernando, and hopefully we continue building on the partnership in the long course. Expect my email with the final price offers before, and the day to day perfect. We're looking.

Fernando Plaz (fernando.plaz@assetplan.cl):
  Forward to it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. All right. Fernando. Cheers again. Have a good day. Bye bye.
