Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Neil. How are you?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  I'm good. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you. Are we expecting more people to join in as well? Or shall we get started?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Yeah, please start just me. Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Perfect. Thank you for scheduling this session with us. My name is Yukta and I'll be helping you with the evaluation today. We'll figure out if hiver is the right fit for you. I would just want to have a few details from you. If you could help me understand what made you look out for a solution at this time and what exactly you're working on so that accordingly, I can give you a brief demonstration.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay. No problem. Okay. Firstly, I would like to introduce our company. Oz. Hypersolar is the solar company that helps the customer to design and install and also take care of the solar system. So, currently, we want to find out the one, find out the solution to solve the after sales service. We just found online and your platform could be, could help us to improve our after service quality.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And currently, how?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Sorry, I couldn't hear clearly. Excuse me.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you hear me hello?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Yeah. Here now. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Could you help me understand when you say after sales service, how do you manage it today? Do you have a generic email address? How many people do we have in this team?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  So, for our after service team, we have the six people in total. Currently, we use the Gmail to manage every case, for example, if the customer have any issue, they will send us the email about every issues and we reply then, but there are a lot of the case, so we couldn't manage it efficiently. So I would like to know whether your platform can help us to improve. Got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It, and I'm assuming that then everybody's logging into the info at the rate account, right? And then picking these emails up.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Not really because we got six people in total, but we, maybe for just two people per day, two day awaits the after service case.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Two people per day?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is it like on a shift basis? Do these people differ on a day to day basis? Or are these constant, two people are responsible for managing these emails?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  That's our current issue. For example, just one case, there will be maybe three or four people, three or four people employees to deal with because they have the different time to work? So, yeah, it's a lot. It's very complex.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  That's the reason why I want to find out the better way. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But whoever is working on any email at a point, they log into info at the rate only, right? And then only, they pick these emails up.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Yeah. We both log in our office, our info, office email. So we both use one email.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So it's you and your colleague who are primarily working on these emails, right? Yeah, correct.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, when you implement a new solution, would you want you and your colleague only to be part of this or would you want to invite more people as well?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  It's okay, I can get more familiar with your platform, and then I will tell my colleagues after that.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, it's going to be two people to start with, right?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Yeah. You mean in the future? Yeah?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, as you start using the tool, you would want to do it with two people, right? There are two people in the team who are currently working on this account or are there more?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Just two, maybe two, yeah, two or three. Yeah, but I want to know your function first.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, that's fine. I'll show you how the platform looks like and you are using, by the way. Sorry?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Sorry for interrupting. I just want, I just have the one question. So, after this lesson, no lesson, after this meeting, we can use the demo, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we have a trial for seven days, so you can test the tool. I also want to understand like, do you guys have your own individual, your individual outlook accounts?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  You mean our individual account?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, your individual credentials?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  No, we both use the one account, so that's the key point, right? We couldn't use only one account to manage the whole thing.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So you will have to first get your individual accounts, individual logins. And only then you can use a solution like hiver because we would be creating a shared inbox using the info at the rate email address at which you're receiving all the emails and you would be logging in using your outlook credentials, your individual account to log into hiver. And that's where you can then manage the inbox. So it'll look something like this. So this is how hiver looks like you log into this window by using your own credentials. Like I have done from Yukta at the rate demo account. And from here, we will create one of such shared inboxes like currently, I have five of these. So we will create one that will be connected to your info, email address so that both you and your colleague, you log in using your own credentials. And then you can manage this inbox right here and can do different things in regards to any email that comes into this inbox. You can basically assign between yourself who is working on which email at a time. You can track the progress on these and do a couple of things here.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay. Just one question. I had one question. Could you move the assigning? So yeah, this one, I can see a lot of the people.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  So I just saw your price on the online. So for each member, if I, for example, if I got the six people, six members to use this platform, so we have to buy the six people package, right? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So we set in a bucket of five actually. So the minimum number of users to start using hiver is going to be five. From there, it's 10 1,520. So if you're looking at six people, you'll have to buy 10 licenses. If you can accommodate in five, I think that would be great. So, yeah. And each user is going to cost like 25 dollars. If you look at the growth plan.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay. But we can only, okay, let me think because me and my college are the main people to manage all the case. So we can only just buy… the two users. We can start with two.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Also, yeah. So our minimum users are two to start with. And then from there, it's 510 in the increment of five basically.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay. No problem. Okay. Yeah, I see. But.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Before you use this, you'll have to first get your outlook credentials only. Then you'll be able to use hiver.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay. One question. So currently, we got the surveys at ozhypersolar. Com. Au, this email account. So as you mentioned before, we can link this official account to our individual account and our individual account, just like that, right? I'm.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  sorry, I didn't understand. Could you rephrase that?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  I just one question. Your platform is just, how can I say, for example, just, okay. One question, if we use your platform, so we only add this platform to our just one of service account, email account, or do we need to create more new email account? It's.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  up to you, how many share inboxes you want to create? So this after sales one that you mentioned is info at the rate, right?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  So, for the after service, we've got another account. It's called service account service at ozhypersolar.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Com. Au, yeah. So you can create the share inbox on that as well. So you can create multiple share inboxes, you can create one with info at the rate one with service at the rate. And yeah, you can manage both here.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay. Could you show me how to, could you click the support? So, for example… if the, let me think if the client sent us email to the service account. So I just log in your platform, I just log in this, my individual account and I can see the email that the client just sent me, right? I send it to the service account, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Exactly. So any email that's being written to service at the rate will come into this unassigned section. And from here, then you will assign between you and your colleague. So here, this is where you see all the members who are part of this inbox, right? So whoever is part of it, you can see them, you can assign these between yourselves and those emails you will see in the mind section here, which are assigned to you, and then you can just pick them reply to them. And according to,

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  okay. So for, because we have six people to deal with the after service. So we need to create six individual account?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, you will have to have six outlook accounts. Yes.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Let me think. Okay, okay. Could you show me the more about the platform? Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I think this is how it's gonna look like you can assign emails. You will reply using the email templates. So when you are responding to repetitive sort of emails, you can use a template which you can insert to an email and hit send. So you can do this, you can collaborate also with your colleagues right here. So in case I want to collaborate with someone on this email instead of forwarding it or marking each other in CC, we can go into the notes section and I can mention any of my colleagues and we both can, you know, share notes in regards to this email, right? So we, Aditya will receive a notification here and we both can converse. You can also go into the team section. This is where we can see everybody's open emails that whoever is working on what email? So that we have that complete transparency. And if someone is out of office, let's say Ishan is not available. I can easily select all his current emails and I can assign it to probably myself so that we don't miss anything. So we have complete transparency visibility on everybody's work at all times. So… this would be the basic workflow, anything specific that you are looking that I have not covered. I'm happy to assist you with that as well.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  No good. So, okay. So what's the next step?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Next step would be for you to discuss this. Understand, if, you know, you would want to introduce individual logins, if you are ready to do that, then you can do the trial with us. We have a seven day trial. I can help you with the setup and everything. And then whenever you're ready, we can take this forward from there.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Hello?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, Neil, can you hear me? Yeah.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Yeah, I can hear you. Okay. So for the, what you mentioned before is the individual account, but I thought from, I thought I saw the message from your website, is the every individual account should be the, how can I say, the company account like such as nail at ozhypersolar. Com, au, right? Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It has to be, it has to be a company account? Yes?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  It has to come to your account. Yeah. So we have to create the company account first and then to use the demo for everyone by using your every individual account? Yes?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  I see.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Do you think that is going to be possible for you to, because of course, it's going to cost you as well because you'll have to buy. Yeah.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Correct. Yeah, that's the reason why, because we, if we, normally, we didn't have any individual account, we just have the company account, the main account. If we can create more individual account, it will cost a lot, you know.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Especially for the Gmail. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, that is something you'll have to consider internally if you are ready to do that, because then, of course, currently, the way you're working, of course, it creates a lot of chaos and it's not the ideal way to go about it. So, eventually, as the company grows, you will have to give individual logins to everyone and that's the only way that you can then centralized or centralize your own entire function, right? So, I'm happy to work with the cost as long as hiver is concerned, but of course, you'll have to see if you are open to introduce these individual logins. And if you are, then I'm happy to assist you further from here.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay. May I use the trials first? You think by using the company account, the service account? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can log in using your info at the rate or service at the rate. So you can do that. That's fine. You can play around with the tool, see how it works. Yeah.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  That's right? Then. Why? Yeah, I need to use this platform first and they decide later, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can do that. Yeah.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can log into hi app, hyperhq. Com. I've just put it in the chat and from here, you can just log in and you will get a demo account which you can play with, explore and see how it works.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  It's just a demo, not the, okay demo. Okay? I see. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I mean, it's gonna work. Yeah. No, no. It's gonna work. You are on outlook, right? You're hosted on Microsoft? Yeah, correct. Yeah. So that's why I've shared this and you can create your, but you have given Gmail as your email provider. Yeah.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Or both Gmail.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But above, I see that it's Microsoft. So… are you hosted on Microsoft or Google workspace? Google?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Google workplace, I think you're.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hosted on Google. Yeah. Okay. In that case, if you're on Google, then it's the same. It's just that we have a different product for both Microsoft and Google workspace. For Google workspace, it sits right within your Gmail itself. So it's gonna work the same way. What I showed you there. You will have your shared inbox. But, yes, you'll have to have your individual Gmail accounts for you to be able to log in and then be able to manage the shared inboxes.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay. Yeah. I know the reason why, you thought I haven't I'm not the mac, not the Gmail, because my college to arrange this lesson and arrange this meeting so he, she may use her own her individual laptop that's reason, why? Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But you're hosted on Gmail itself, right? You're using Gmail in the.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  company? Yeah, we both use your Gmail. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's perfect. You can just then, you know, if you want, I can help you with it, you just have to download the extension. So you can just type on a new tab, hybrid Chrome extension, and you can just download that extension on your Gmail, and you can start the trial and test the tool and see how it works for you. Okay?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  I download now. So download this first and add this into.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  I got it. Yeah, you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Will get a demo account to test this with as a shared inbox, so you can test it on that, see how it's working for you. And then.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Sorry, I do. I couldn't understand what do you mean? So, what can I do now? So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you share your screen with me?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  It's no worries. Let me think, just download minis. Okay?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Download hybrid in Gmail. Start free trade, right? Yeah. And continuing with Google and… surveys account?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Wait a minute. I called my boss to get the very, the code. Wait a minute, just a few minutes, just two minutes. Wait a minute, because I need to log in our company account. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. Thank.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  You.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  my boss didn't answer my phone call that's.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  fine. I think you can just authenticate it. It's pretty simple. And once you do that, you can, you will just be entered the trial and then you can just start using it and see how it's working out for you. Okay?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  No problem. So that's all for now, right? Okay. No problem. I will try later. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. And so what do you suggest from the neck from your knee? Like how would you like to proceed? You want to discuss this internally with your boss and propose the solution or how do you want to take this forward?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  I saw your platform. It's not only about the after survey, it's but also about the other operation thing. Yeah, I can. Yeah. So I can discuss with my boss to figure out what exactly we want. Yeah, we not only want the after service but yeah, but also need more. So I will discuss with my boss later. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I mean, you can spread this like you can extend this for other departments as well as long as you have a shared email addresses that you guys are working on collaborating and managing. So I think hiver will work for on, for all such use cases. So you could let me know once you discuss this, because currently, the biggest question is that whether you will be open to introduce individual logins, and if you are, then we can take it from there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can just let me know. I'll share the details with you on the email. And whenever you're ready or whatever update you have, you could let me know, and then I can help you from there.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Sorry, I just, I need to send my, I need to send our company account to you. And then after I log in, so you will help me to, use the demo, right? You?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Don't have to send me anything. Your trial is already activated. You have already downloaded it. So you can just test this at your, on your Gmail account itself.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Okay. I try now.

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Amen.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is there anything else that I could help you with now?

Neil Pan (info@aussiehybridsolar.com.au):
  Yeah, that's all. Thank you so much. All.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right. Thank you so much for your time. Take care. Bye bye.
