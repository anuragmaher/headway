Call: Hiver Trial Kick Off
Date: 2025-11-08T00:32:05+05:30
================================================================================

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on guys?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Hello? Hey, Cole. Good to see you again.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, khamini. Hey, Jen, what's going on guys?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Man.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I see ally joining too. Perfect.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah. I've got ally here. She's one of my PMS so I wanted her to just get an understanding of the platform as well. She's got a ton of clients and email volume that she deals with. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah. But since we last met Cole, I set up the hiver demo or trial on inbox this morning, I've been playing in it. Yeah. And so I realized my shared inbox that I set up was for my actual email and not like a client email that I should have. So we created alias for one. And I saw that things were filtering in, which was actually really cool. So, I guess… how do you typically run like a trial kickoff? I mean, I didn't want to hijack it, but I want to just understand.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So usually, what I would do is take you through like the, you know, downloading process, add the users go through the inbox settings and stuff like that just to make sure you're aware of like everything we have to offer.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah. Let me send out your invite since I've done all of that already. And then we can probably just like share screen and go through from there.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's perfect. We can see what you got like set up and we can just go through what you have going on.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah, Ali, I know I kind of threw this on you last minute. Actually, I don't know if I want you to download this though right away. Up to you if you want to. I'm just going to do it. Let's see here.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Ali, I don't know your email off the top of my head. Is it just your first and last name? Yes. Alison. Okay. Got it. Alison kujini. Yeah, got it. I'm going to make her, I'm assuming just members, right? Can still just see inboxes… save and I'll share my screen for everyone's sake. So, yeah… we.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  okay, perfect. So I see. Okay. So you invited, yeah, you invited, Jen, you invited Alison and then I,

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  see, I created this. We had a, we created an alias email for this one client and then we, how… do I go back? And then, yeah. And so things were filtering in through there. So if I go back to, I guess what I was like, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Would you want to invite Kevin to? I see Kevin is joining on the call today. Is this something that we'd want to get him involved? Oh.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah, he's my other project manager. Oh, awesome. Look at my star players are here. Let's go. Hey, Kevin.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  What's going on? Kevin?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Hey.

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  What's going on? Sorry, I'm just apologies that I'm late.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  No worries. Yeah, I probably won't invite Kevin right now since I've got Alan playing in it. That's enough. But I did want Kevin at least to see the integration here and talk it out loud and like whatever questions you guys have on the platform like Cole with hiver here is like here to answer it.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  So I just kind of wanted to show you guys this integration. I know we've looked at things like this before, but essentially, this is a native, you know, Gmail tooling for, you know, email volume. And what I did this morning was I set up what they call a shared inbox. And so we created like this American eagle email, for example, here at greenlight. Com that presumably everyone on that external team would email directly to their own client email instead of emailing like an Allie or Kevin directly. And that way it would be accessed across a shared inbox. And so as things come in, they're assigned it's really cool. They have like AI customer sentiment if it's an angry email, a happy email. And there's the one thing I didn't see with the tagging, I guess tags. So tags are at an inbox level. Cole, is that correct?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So tags are at an inbox level, so you can create specific tags like firm, American eagle, you know, contact reasons, stuff like that, and you can leverage those tags to create different like folders, views and also provide analytics on the back end.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Got it. And so I was thinking about tags for us guys as like potentially… like how we have our shared inboxes today. So we could do like a comments thread tag a plan review tag, permit ops, review ops tag. And then as things come in, you know, you can assign. So when you click into an email, for example, is this how I open the sidebar? Yes. So I can like assign this to somebody on my team and it's like an action for them or let's say plans come in for our review, we can create, you know, a plan review because we have like some shared inboxes right now or like group inboxes and they're honestly just becoming hard to manage because of the number of project volumes that we have. So if you could at least like, are we able to filter tags within an inbox? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So if you go down to all views?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Okay. And then once.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You create tags, so you don't have any tags created yet, but you'll start to be able to create views. So just create one. For example, let's.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  see if I did like comment thread… and I did.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Plan.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Review. Okay. And then I go back and I say that's right? All of yous. I guess nothing's tagged in it either. So I have to, maybe if I tag this email, how do I tag an email?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. See. Yeah, right right there. Yeah, you can just find a tag all.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then if you go to all views and hit the plus… so then see on the right hand side, those different, oh.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  I think, yeah, got it. And.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then once, you can create custom fields as well in tandem with tags to further slice and dice and those, the custom fields will be available over here for filtering if you do create them.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Okay. So hold on if I said.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you want to see all open, you know, all open or pending because pending's still not closed, right? So we, I would recommend keeping pending where it's like associated with that tag, then you can name the view and save.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  It, oh, I see that's like all comments, all right. Save. And then I, okay. So, I can just look at everything.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, and see now the test is in the all comments view and you can star that too. So if certain people want to star certain things, you'll see like a star button and that will be in like that initial dropdown once you click on the star though.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Got it. And so, yeah, and then, so similarly to other, you know, platforms, we've looked at guys like there's like this activity thread. So you can like have conversation about an email. If you want feedback around there, there's obviously templating and things like that. What are linked conversations?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that's if you want to link two threads that have relation to each other. So if there's two conversations that you want to be linked for easy access, going back and forth, you can link them.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Let's say a client is talking about something and they send another email on a different thread, but they're about the same thing. I can link another conversation.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  One thing I didn't see when I was setting this up was let's say now we talked about, obviously, the client has to email this to get sent to this shared inbox. What about like with someone with their like at handle like at American eagle, that is emailing directly to let's say they send Allie an email, but we don't want it to get lost in her inbox. I didn't see where that gets set.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Up. Yeah. So go to the admin panel.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Top right. Yeah. And then go admin panel, go to shared inboxes. And then go to automations.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then create automation. Oh, I think it actually, we have to enable it for your account, the personal inbox, the shared mailbox automation. So that's something our team just has to enable for you. Yeah.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Okay. And so it could be like if any email with the, at whatever comes to my personal inbox, auto forward to shared inbox.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's correct? So, if any time that, you know, email comes from a specific domain specific company, let's make sure it automatically goes to the shared mailbox for tracking visibility and like collaborative purposes.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Do you have a limitation on automations? I see this or? No? It's just the name?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, that's just the character? No. So, with our elite version, which is the package you would need for the personal inbox or shared mailbox automations, you get unlimited?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Cool. Okay. We talked about assignments. We talked about analytics. We talked about templates.

Ally Cugini (allyson.cugini@greenlite.com):
  I think assigning tasks on the like an email that comes in is so cool. And speaking of American eagle, I just downloaded it, I don't know if we can do it now, but for example, like the email we just got from Bob, he wants us to resubmit ASAP and I can't access their procore to download the plans. So, I feel like this is something I could see the email tag you and just ask you, hey, can you download the plans off procore upload them so that I can check them out? Yeah, I think that's.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  really cool. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Just making, you know, everyone's lives easier for internal comms and client experience.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  So, if she were to tag me in something like that, right? I would see it here in my overall notification. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And if you click on those, it takes you right to the thread. So any notification you click on it'll, put you right, exactly, you know, to that conversation, whatever it might be.

Ally Cugini (allyson.cugini@greenlite.com):
  So, I downloaded it and it,

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  wants.

Ally Cugini (allyson.cugini@greenlite.com):
  me to give access… do I give both permissions?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. You want to give it access, read write?

Ally Cugini (allyson.cugini@greenlite.com):
  Okay. Because it sounds scary at first. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, no, it's we're not doing anything with your email data. The email data is yours. It lives in Gmail.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  My question about like obviously integration into the existing work, like not workflow, but like we already have like thousands of email threads going on, right? So, it's like, how do you like besides like starting to copy this email and giving directive? Like, is there another easy way to start pushing these things into shared inboxes, like how do you help customers with that onboarding transition?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we can one import historical emails. So, if you want to bring in historical emails into hiver, we do have that capability.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Like from your back end though, right? Like we wouldn't be able to do that on our own?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we would need to assist you with the importing of historical emails.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that's how we kind of help bring in some historical things. And then from a client perspective, I think setting up the personal inbox and shared mailbox automation is going to help a lot because it just sounds like a lot of people are reaching out to individual folks when you want.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  To, and it's unlimited shared inboxes as well.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yep. On the elite versions, unlimited shared mailboxes, unlimited automations, tags, all that stuff, that's, the peak package. It gives you like the whole kit and caboodle.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Can you move something from one shared inbox to another?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes. So that is a possibility. You can either do that with automations or you can do that manually. But like we can create an automation where it's like, you know, you apply a tag and it's going to remove it from this shared mailbox and then add it to another.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  You apply a tag that can move it from one shared inbox to another?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And there could be other triggers as well that could move it, but that's just one that's just one example.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  I think I'm trying to give the example here. So like we have like a shared email that we use for like all of our like regulatory logins on our portals. Like that, we work with different like government agencies. And so right now, like all of those communications come into like one alias email and then everyone has access to it, but it's not a shared inbox. So I would love to convert that to a shared inbox. But sometimes those communications are client or project specific. So it's like if you could just farm out them as they go into the right shared inbox, if that's the catch, all, that would be an interesting.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. And that's something we can further speak with our technical support team. They're very knowledgeable on, you know, our automations and that's what I was going to serve for our next call is bring my solutions consultant on my side so we can map out, you know, some of this stuff a little further.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah. Okay. And then we've been talking about shared inboxes at like the customer level. Some of our customers would have. I don't know guys what 20 30 projects at a time. So like I can see… like I don't like, I don't know right now, our team likes to use labels by customer with like the parent label aspect and you have a parent label of your logo, and then you have labels underneath, that are nested that are project level. And so I think I did see that you could create labels still within hiver. I did see that. Where did I see that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you can create shared labels. I just don't recommend it because like tags are the same thing but they provide a.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Functionality, right? So, I was thinking like instead of it getting labeled, it would get tagged as like the project name.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  And so you would know, and so you can have multiple tags on a project, right? So, if I'm looking at all of you guys and I have like what 20 American eagle projects I would be able to, as long as I'm tagging it correctly, I could be able to see all of those for that project potentially. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  How does I think I looked at auto tagging, right? So it's like if you were to create like, I don't know, like if a project had this specific name, it would automatically tag the email for example. Yeah… because that's that one way of thinking about auto tagging because obviously tagging every single.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we can create like a rule where it's like, you know, email comes in. We've identified, you know, these keywords or phrases that map out to a specific project or whatever. Then we can automatically apply that tag based on those keywords or phrases.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Right. And I saw a similar thing here with auto. This is, so auto assignment means assigning to a person, never mind. So this is like when you do round Robin, never mind.

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  I'm sorry, just to clarify on that with the tags like those tags happen underneath the shared inbox.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  But you can like filter by like each tag, you can click and it'll only show those items based on said tag.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Does that make sense? Yeah. So you can click like you can look at like a specific tag view itself, if it's just associated with that one tag or if you're looking for a view that has maybe multiple tags coupled with it, you'd want to create that customized view?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah. You would go to all views and say, yeah.

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  Yeah, I think I'm more just curious about like the individual where it's like, you know, American eagle, century city games, whatever it is and like be able to just click into the one project and be able to see anything in that specific tag as long as the.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah. So in my head, it would go to tags and then these are all the tags that we saw. So you would see like we would probably have like three core tags or like four core tags across every single shared inbox, right? For common thread plan, review. Maybe it's like permit ops review ops. And then like every other tag would just be a project name. Makes sense?

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  Okay. So I guess then like you're saying like we'd have a project tag that would overlap with, you know, plan review or common.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah, exactly. So this is century city's tag and a plan review tag. So it would be for both. Yeah.

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  That makes sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Allie, what questions are in your mind about this?

Ally Cugini (allyson.cugini@greenlite.com):
  I don't think I have any questions. Obviously, there's no way that us like commenting or having a conversation about an email would ever somehow be like visible to the client. So, yeah, I think being able to do tasks on email with each other and having conversation about it is really cool. And then also being able to just have visibility on all relevant email threads per project is really cool. But I don't think I have any questions.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  What are these custom fields Cole?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that's a further way to collect data around the conversations that you might think is important or pertinent to collect for, you know, reporting purposes or for also creating those views. So like you can create like drop down fields, date range fields, text box fields and value fields to, you know, understand follow up dates, maybe understand, you know, what priority of an email is it or what task is at hand and things of that nature?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Okay, one.

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  Question I have is like, are you guys able to do anything that pushes like a nudge for me? Like say I sent an email two days ago and no one responded like, is there a way for that to resurface for me? Like a big problem that I have sometimes like, you know, we send a bunch of emails out. Hey, we need this to someone we need this and like they don't respond and then it gets lost in my own like send folder. Yeah. Do you have anything that can that bumps that up to me and be like, hey, follow up on this?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So there's a couple ways we can do that. One way is we can create an automation where it's like, you know, Kevin, you send an external reply to a client, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Three days go by. We don't receive an external response. Let's send an automated email being like, hey, like just wanted to follow up here. Can you please update these details, whatever the message you want it to be? So we can actually automate that whole process for you to ensure that, you know, if too much time has gone by since the client has, you know, responded to that email where you needed information, like we'll just send that nudge email.

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  Gotcha. Is it, what about like a nudge that it's like a draft almost like maybe I still might want to look back and see like, you know, something could have changed where I requested like this document. Turns out they don't need it, but they owe me something else like, is that a possibility?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we can do SLA notifications as well. So, let's say 48 hours go by and the conversation is still open, right? You haven't like closed out that thread, whatever it might be. It can send you a notification being like, hey, you need to respond to this?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Got it. Cool. I had some notes. I just want to make sure if I got this stuff. Okay. Let's see. So we're thinking about, yeah, customer level inbox that's shared across the full team, like our project team.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  When customers email, let's say americadeagle at greenlight. Com. When we respond back, what do they see that response from? Are they seeing that response from the shared inbox alias or is it coming from one of us?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that is up to you. It can be either or you could have it. So it's coming from your, you know, individual email address. So you have that personalized touch. If you want it to come from the shared mailbox name, it can come from there as well. But regardless, they'll all continue to live in that shared mailbox for visibility and collaboration.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Got it. So like… it's I see it can come from, no, like if I'm operating it, I have to set that up is what you're saying then?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it has to be set up and I can send you this. It's a partial Google setting slash hiver. It's a combination. Yeah, I.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  guess I'm just wanting to make sure I'm understanding because like if I'm, let's say Michael sent an email to American eagle, but I'm responding as khamni Fenley when he hits reply, is he hitting reply back to khamni, Fenley or is he hitting reply back to American eagle? You know what I mean? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that's totally up to you. Like if you respond with, you know, your Kevin email to the client like it'll be responded back to the email that you responded with. If it's the American eagle one, it'll be that one. So just, it depends what you respond to the client as… which, you know, is totally up to you in the settings. And whatever makes the most sense for the experience that, you know, you're looking at?

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  Yeah, I think that makes sense. You just default to like probably the person khamni, whoever sends it.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah, as long as long as like when they, it's not about sending it, it's like when they respond back, is it like?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It'll still live in the shared mailbox. So, even if Kevin responds from his personal, this whole thread will still live in hiver, it won't affect it.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  It would,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  it won't affect it. So even if he responds from his personal or the shared, it still lives in that thread in the shared mailbox where everyone has access to it.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Because why? Though, because the automation is set up because his handle is feeding into my inbox, or because the thread is already native into the shared inbox?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's correct, because the thread was added to the shared mailbox, it will be there in perpetuity.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Perpetuity. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I know we are coming up at time here as well. I'm happy to serve up a call next week with my solutions consultant to kind of further flesh out some of this stuff. Yeah, as you've had more time with it.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah. I mean, I'm sure you get this all the time. Like this is our main artery of communication for everything. So, obviously, we've been trying to be as diligent as possible when making a decision like this. And so I, just before, with a couple minutes left, I wanted to show Kevin and Ali too like the ability to like if something is assigned to, you can close it out as a task. There's like templates here and, you know, and even AI compose, which I think is interesting. And then the share drafts. Let's talk about this like help me please. I can share a draft for someone to review. To like, who do I, like? I can send this to somebody, or?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I can, yeah, you can share the draft that everyone can see the response you're thinking of sending and then you can write the note on the right hand side being like, hey, like what are your thoughts on this draft? Like should I edit it? Whatever, like.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Ali is loving that because we do a lot of that in slack right now. It'd be nice to just do that right? In email. Yeah. Okay. All right. Guys. Any last questions?

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  I guess just like biggest?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Question. Yeah. What are your red flags?

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  No, no, no red flags. I just like the auto filtering would be like the biggest thing for me and making sure like if there's a way that, you know, that automation really is great on like not just the shared inbox but also on a tag level would be huge because that like eats up a lot of time for me. There's just like, you know, however many projects and like getting them in the correct folders. Like I love being able to like click into a single project. In this case tag, see exactly where's like where is this let off rather than like trying to dig through the American eagle inbox, be able to go like I need to know what's happening in like this one project city jumping in there. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent. This is all something also that, yeah, if you did move forward with a partnership like you would get a customer success manager who's going to like help with implementation training and standing up of the platform, these automations and all that stuff. So they'll work with you to map it out to like your specific flows like what you want to accomplish. It's a total white glove experience.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Nice. That's awesome. That includes like onboarding and training materials, you said?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. No extra cost that comes within the licensing fee.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  That comes within the licensing fee. Okay? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But when would be a good time for you next week to touch base with my solutions engineer?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Real quick.

Ally Cugini (allyson.cugini@greenlite.com):
  While you're looking that up, I was just going to say it also would probably be really helpful for like Kevin example, we're getting notifications from Pembroke pines, the jurisdiction if we can set it so that like it knows my permit number comes to me and your permit number goes to you and Dana, I think that would be awesome.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah. Well, yeah. You could just tag it to that project, And push it. So instead of it like we would have a regulatory shared inbox and then let's say like a review or any PC would go in there like, hey, this is my project tag and move it to the right one. Then you can just know, yeah.

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  Ideally, though, have that like move automatically because.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  of the permit number associated?

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  Yeah, it just goes right to the American eagle. Something tag like for me that's where it's like would be extremely helpful than having to do that ourselves.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  I think we need to really think about the automation part of it.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  I think we get the manual portions and that all makes sense. But yes, how can we be smarter than not just us tagging a bunch of stuff? I think that, that's definitely where we could probably dig in with your solutions person there, Cole.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  I'm looking at either Wednesday morning or Thursday throughout the day if either of those times work for your team and are.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  you est?

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah, we're est. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. I can do nine 30 est on the twelfth.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Yeah, I could do that too. I think Ali and Kevin can as well. I'd like them to stay with this since they've been super helpful here today.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So, I'll send over, I just updated the invite for November twelfth at nine 30 am est… invited my sluice console in to talk this through a little bit more. And then, yeah, there's I also extended your trial by… another five days to the nineteenth to give us some more time to test and like flesh things out.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Cool. I'll send Kevin an invite as well. So, if you want to play with this, kev, you know, you've got a week to do so. Okay.

Kevin Rogovich (kevin.rogovich@greenlite.com):
  Awesome. Perfect.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Thank you guys. It was nice to meet you all. And I look forward to touching base on Wednesday all.

Khamini Fennelly (khamini.fennelly@greenlite.com):
  Right. Everyone. Thank you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
