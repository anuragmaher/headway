Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  hello, Daniel?

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Hi. How are you? I'm.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  doing quite well. How about yourself?

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Good. Thank you. Good. Thank you.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Well, I appreciate you booking some time to learn about hiver. Yes, I'm Alex… I'm an account executive over here. I've been in the customer experience, customer support… yeah, customer service, customer software space for the last 10 years. So, I have a pretty good understanding and, you know, my thought for today, you know, can give you an overview of hiver, step through the platform, but would really love to learn a little bit more about your business. It looks like you're doing accounting in South Africa, plus potentially bookkeeping and all those other elements. Yes. Yeah, but I'll open the floor to you. Would love to learn a little bit about yourself, how you heard about hiver and what you want to get out of today. So.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Basically, I run a small accounting firm at the moment. It's just me at the moment, but I'm looking to organize cases. So, we work with the South African revenue service, the equivalent of the irs, a lot here in South Africa where you email them or you take a call and there's notes and we just want to organize that note, those notes on a per client basis and go back to cases if they're unfollowed. So, a lot of it is going to be note taking and a lot of it's going to be for example, an email query from a client that gets ticketed and attended to and managed. So it's not just on email but it's actually through a ticketing system.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  OK. And so you're looking for a new ticketing system?

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Basically, I don't have one at the moment. So I'm looking to implement one. Great.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So hiver, are you on Gmail? Yes, I am. Yeah. So hiver is an extension of Gmail. So we are essentially a Chrome extension.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK, which?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Augments the Gmail inbox into like an AI powered help desk. So think all of the classical elements of ticketing… we're just overlaying that in Gmail. And I can show you exactly what that looks like.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK. That's I think that's something I'm going to look quite excited about to see what it looks like. Great.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's a, it's a good use case. We work with a lot of financial services groups… really like financial services and operations are the two key… types of clients that we serve.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Let me show you.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Great. Here we go.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, currently, I'm in Gmail, we have the hiver Chrome extension up here.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK. And,

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  what this does is again, we are overlaying metadata on top of Gmail, to create this ticketing system.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  The first five segments of the inbox should look very familiar.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Yes.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And then what we technically do is we take an alias, so it could be your name. It could be info at or a different alias of Gmail. And we point it to an inbox.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, when I click into this, we're going to see we have in support, we could have unassigned mine team views and then custom views. A custom view is really just saying like show me all emails or conversations that contain the following attributes.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And when I'm looking at, you know, these emails here, a couple of things to call out before we even, you know, click into the email. We can have an SLA amended. So being able to time how quickly we're getting the work done… sentiment analysis, and then AI tagging.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Now, when I open the email, we're going to see, you know, we have Jake from Phoenix digital writing about something that's not really relevant for accounting. But what's interesting is on the right hand rail, we're going to have… the inbox is written into who's it is assigned to statuses open pending closed. And then we're going to have like an activity feed where you can leave notes. We can relate other conversations together.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Sorry, just give me one second.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Great. OK. So I did that refresh because not everything was showing up.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  We also have custom drop down fields. So you get to set what these are, but the whole concept is there's like unique attributes to the types of clients that you serve that you'd like to organize them by?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  You can also do like an AI ticket summary.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK, you,

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  can link to other conversations on this individual. So things that are directly related to this one?

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Or… we.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  can have contact level data. So, you know, this is Jake at Phoenix digital. All the emails that he's written in. Yeah. And if you're managing a little bit more of like a B to B experience for your clients, we could have like domain level emails too.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  OK. And that's managed all through a Chrome extension?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we're a Google cloud partner. We have over 3,000 businesses that use this. It's kind of a radical concept in the sense. Yeah, but all of our data is like hosted on Aws and we're just, you know, essentially amending metadata based on these tags that we've applied. And then we're creating that like relational database to keep everything organized. I.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  See. Okay. And then you obviously have like a list like classic ticketing included.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So when you say classic ticketing, is it you want to just to create like a ticket and have a relation with that's the news. So we don't really have classic ticketing in that sense. Okay. It's more of tickets that are associated with the conversation.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  I see. Yeah. Okay. No, it looks really good. Like I enjoyed the demo. It's just the case of if it's going to work for me. I do need to do some more research to see if it's going to fit my purpose for what I want to use it for. And if I'm going to stick with Gmail or not switch over to Microsoft completely because of legislative requirements in South Africa, there's obviously very much a privacy and what's… the word confidentiality between myself and my clients. Whereas when I open this up for emails, it's very much private data that's going to be exchanged. And I have to be very wary about that.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. The interesting thing about what we're doing in hiver is none of the email data is actually retained. So, you know, we have some like AI functionalities which is going to skim the email. We call it a co pilot, which I feel like is a little misnomer because Microsoft calls theirs a co pilot. So it's more of like an AI assistant that can help like draft emails, route them. But if we're using this, we could retain email data for like 10 to 20 minutes before it's automatically deleted. If we're not using this element like we are never storing your data. It's just, we have a metadata that's passed over. We're amending essentially these labels to an inbox which allows us to organize it within hiver.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  I see. Okay. Now, I'll definitely have a look again at the website. If I might ask pricing, I see you've got a pricing tab open.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yep. So what we discussed today would probably fall under the growth tab… we offer this is for an annual commitment and we have a two seat minimum. Okay? So if you wanted to use it on a month to month basis, it would be 70 dollars a month, no commitment.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Yeah, we.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Offer a free trial if you wanted to get started that way.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And then finally within the application, we have in app support. So we have technical support that's available.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  You know, 24 seven, 365. They'll help you get set up, answer any questions? Yeah, we're here for you wouldn't be much of a support platform without that.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Okay. Now, I'll definitely have a look as I said, it's still a very small outfit but looking to improve efficiencies from the get go. Let me do some more research and thank you for your time.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Thank you for your time as well. It sounds like you're looking for something that's a little bit more ticket centric. Yes. Is that fair to say? Yeah?

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  It's fair to say a bit more ticket centric and is able to assign tickets to different users. So it's more of a classical ticketing system than what you guys are offering. But again, still doing research on the topic.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. It depends on when you end up adopting, but we also have another system that we're building. So, this is hiver for outlook… and this is going to be more of like that classic ticketing tool. I.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  See.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  What I don't have yet, which is coming down the pike is so kind of same concept of shared inboxes… we're going to be adding like we've essentially added the ability to draft emails, which is like kind of drafting a ticket where we can now support the metadata on the right hand rail.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Okay.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I don't think it's exactly what you're looking for yet, but that's where we're going in the near term. My product team says we'll have parity with the Gmail app in 45 days. Okay? And then looking a little further out, I think then we'll be starting to like create like classic tickets.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Okay. But.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  That doesn't help you right now? I know. No.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  No, it's well, it could be implemented in the next couple of months only. But like I said, I'm still doing the research and just seeing what's out there on the market,

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Well, it was very nice to meet you if there's any additional questions that you have, like we're happy to answer. And, yeah, let us know will.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Do, thank you so much for your time, Alex.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Thank you Daniel.

Daniel Scott (daniel@accountingexperts.co.za):
  Cheers. Bye bye.
