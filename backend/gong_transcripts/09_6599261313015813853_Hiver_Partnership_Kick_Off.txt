Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  hey, what's up?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Hey, what's going on? Clint? How's everything with you?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good. So, yeah, I saw your notes about being excluded from that round Robin. I do have someone on our sales leadership team also joining shortly to talk through that as well. Is that primarily just within that sales mailbox? Is that where you need that? Or in all the mailboxes?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I need to be able to see what's happening.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Especially in… the sales inbox. I just, I need oversight and, but I don't need to be part of the round Robin.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  And, that's the hang up is I need, you know, sometimes I have to myself or, my sales manager, sometimes we have to go in and, you know, assist or give information or something, right? Right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, you just, you want to be able to keep that visibility but having those round robins happen without you being distributed, that work. That makes total sense.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And Jeevan, did you, I saw you reaching out to the product team about when that could be released. I know that's going to be released shortly. Did you get any further insight on that?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Hi. My name is Jeevan. I lead the sales team here. I have been following along with your conversation with Cole and I've been following along your ask as well. And your ask is very standard given that we already have it in our other product which is built around the Google ecosystem. And rather than the Microsoft one, we're actually stated to release exactly that exclusion feature later this month. And if you gave me time till Monday, I can give you like a really specific answer. And I also want to be absolutely upfront with you and make sure that we're not just saying this and we are going to be delivering it to you on the timeline. So, once that's done, I'm happy to introduce you to our product team, they can maybe show you exactly what's being built right now in terms of our scoped out version and we can get your inputs, answer questions, whatever. So we'll make sure that we key you in.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Sure. Yeah, that sounds great. That one little hang up is really my only issue. I've got a couple of my… a couple of my email addresses connected and so, I can kind of see how it works and functions. This is, this is really kind of what we need. But I do have some people that, you know, are not working leads. I just need that oversight and that's kind of cool.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Of course, very valid. Ask, like I said, we've actually got it. If you want to see what it looks like in our Google product, I can actually show you that right now.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I'd love to see it. Yeah, I mean, I certainly hear you. And I appreciate, you know, that that's something you guys are aware of and bringing to the table. So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because, it is a, very standard ask and we've got it in our, we've got a product each one dedicated to Microsoft, one dedicated to Google and this is our Google product. So if I were to go into our auto assignment page right now and switch it on the same auto assignment, I can say auto assign a round Robin, all inbound conversations and I can exclude users from the round Robin which is here here here and here. As you can imagine engineering and development of two products. Don't always happen concurrently sure. This we've had for a little bit and we're catching up on the we're catching the same feature up on, the product that you've purchased later this month. So I'm going to be able to get back to you with a very like a proper date and also maybe an introduction to our product team Monday, and then we'll sort of set expectations that.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  That's fantastic. I think that really does kind of solve all my problems. So, I think that'll make it pretty useful for us.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Should we throw some time on the calendar for like let's say like in the morning on Tuesday, just so we have it, we can speak with the product team if that's helpful.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Yeah, yeah, it's fine with me.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  And we probably just need about 15, 20 minutes of your time. We'll show you exactly. It's going to be a version of what you just saw, but we'll show you exactly what it looks like in your interface, talk through specifics, you can ask them questions and maybe even like pass on specifics that you might want to see in there so we can, and then we'll give you an expectation.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And Jeevan, I'm actually like very booked out right now. Would you want to throw something on your calendar for Tuesday?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  I can, yeah, absolutely. So let me know what time works, maybe Tuesday morning, 1,520 minutes.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  I'm Mountain Time and I've got a, I've got a first thing in the morning meeting at seven 30, my time after that, my calendar is pretty open. So.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Do you want to do like nine?

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Yeah, that's perfect. Nine, my time.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Nine mountain? Yep.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Yep, that works.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  We can do nine mountain. So, I'm going to throw that on there, hiver sync and next steps, we also sort of take that opportunity to introduce you to your implementations specialist, who is your point of contact as you get started with hiver, and make sure all of these workflows just making sure that your team is fully set up and implemented and your team feels confident in it. So we'll use this time to make that introduction and also talk through this product task.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, and also introduce you to your customer success manager over email today Clinton.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Okay. That sounds like a plan.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right, perfect. We've got some good next steps here. I will follow up with you right after this Clinton, and I hope you have a great weekend.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Cool. Thank you.

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Thanks.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Thanks, guys. Bye.

Clinton McJenkin (clinton@baspartsales.com):
  Thanks guys.
