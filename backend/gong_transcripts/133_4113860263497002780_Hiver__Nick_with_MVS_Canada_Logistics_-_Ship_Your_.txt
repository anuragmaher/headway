================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, Nick. How are you doing?

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Good, yourself.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Doing good. Thanks for checking, Nick. Would it just be the two of us for today or were you expecting anybody else?

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Just us?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Alright, perfect. Alright, Nick. I think it's been a while since we spoke. Just reintroducing myself. I'm Raghav with the account management team here at hiver. I noticed that you're interested in our AI features, and wanted to kick us off by understanding if you've explored or used any of the features on your account so far.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah. So earlier this week or last week, I had let me just try to find that email. Actually… I was in looking at an email about the new automations update that came out and there was something in there. I was just browsing it, updating some of my automations like auto assignment stuff. And there was an AI feature for tagging I believe. And I… tried to get it working. It wasn't working. So I kind of just sent a quick message there to chat and… I'm just reading the transcript here. I said I was reading your new documentation on the refresh interface and came across AI extract in the automations. I began to create an AI extract for the subject and body and then train AI. I had about 20 samples. But when I go to step two, it can only confirm four of them. And then it won't let me on the next step. So I just kind of sent them some screenshots and they said, hey, like you got to jump into a meeting.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  I just couldn't at that time. But then, so I wasn't sure about that. You know, I was just interested in how that works. But also if there's anything else that I'm not doing that I could be using and for my use case, maybe there's other things in AI, but also in hiver's features that I should be doing and just to making things work better. And I think I had another question about setting up more shared inboxes just to see if because I'm going to be, we have made one email. It's like info email, but eventually we're going to switch and have like quotes, mvscanada and tracking mvscanada as emails? And I wasn't sure kind of how that worked when we have multiple ones. Is it going to be exactly the same and everything can be using the automations that I set up or do I have to duplicate everything? So just like basic questions like that like, you know, I'm not, you know, we don't have to even figure out that last, the issue that I had with the, yeah… the in the chat there that I sent to support but, you know, just interested in figuring everything out and just trying to use it more.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, definitely. So, yeah, I mean, like to kick us off in terms of the AI feature suite in itself. I know you'd said that you'd use the tagging but you couldn't necessarily get it to work improperly. You think it's okay. Can you share your screen? Because I think that just might be easier. So, me giving you like a boilerplate demo and walkthrough of things.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah, sure. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. I can see a screen. Yes. Brilliant. All right. So, yeah. So what I'd like for you to do first is click on your hiver logo on the top right? And then admin panel, so we can go to the AI module or console. Yeah, AI agents and that's where tagging lives. Perfect. Click on configure and brilliant. Yeah. So this is pretty much how you can go about training the AI model on the tags of your preference. There's no limits on how many tags you can include to be trained and future state to be run purely by AI right now. As a suggest, like as an example, is there any tag you'd like to use just so that I can walk you through the motions of how you can do this? Click on add tag.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  On the.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  top right?

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  I was thinking here, I… don't know what the tags, because when I go and use it, I don't I'm not really using tags a lot, but I probably should, like, I don't know if some of them aren't tagging like a, oh, wait a second. That's why it's not… photos upload. So these ones are all, you know, okay, unresolved. So, all conversations. So, let me see how it kind of works. I don't really go into this much and I don't use it. I set it up just to see if I can make sure I kind of look at it. And when I look at analytics, it kind of tags them, which is helpful. Yeah, what I think I was trying to do, yeah, cause, I don't know if AI tagging would be useful for this, cause I don't have too many and they're not super necessary, cause it's easy for me to assign tags based on subject line. But what I was doing was this, I was going into admin panel and I forget what was the, let me show you here? I was interested in?

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  AI extract. That's what I was interested in doing, where I can extract subject.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah. In, every shipment that, we have tracking numbers and they have a certain.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  format scheme.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Format, right? And I put a bunch of them in. So it was like I was using like order id and because I think eventually I could create a way to assign the id in a custom field. And then it allows me to then click that custom field link, cause I have a hiver extent. I have a Google… extension, Chrome extension that extracts that field. I'll show you here and makes it linkable, see it here?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Right. See it there? It does it. So it allows any time that it's put in any email or in the subject line, it'll click it'll, allow it to be clicked and open. Maybe I don't have it set up right now. I should… maybe it's not working there, but let me… extensions, details.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Maybe it's not working. But anyways, it would be useful to have it would scan them and then put it over here, in, somewhere and.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It becomes a one click to basically get to the actual thing that it's about. Yeah.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Pull up, yeah, pull up the order or because sometimes, if we get emails in our system, we don't know what order they're from sometimes, And we would like to just have that link rather than having to search the email and find out what it's for, but, you know, it kind of works. Oh, there we go. So it works there now. So see how it opens up something. Yeah, it opens up an order. Opens up there. Yeah. And if, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I see what you're.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  doing, yeah. So that's the kind of thing that's what I was trying to figure out in here. So, I was going to, train AI, right? And I would train AI. And what I did is I went to, let me just go find some order ids. And,

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  there's.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  different, I don't know, not there order id. So I went through here and, I did like 20 of them. They… don't all start with L's, so, I kind of went and tried to find some ones that have, okay… I can even manually, hey,

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Let me just find some other ones.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Just one more should do. I think five's kind of sufficient just to run a test and see what it shows up as.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  I don't want to print in. I'll just change that up, H, and.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Can we click on search?

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Right. So, what it did, it found these ones, I had 20 of them I was searching for, but it didn't allow me to scroll over and see and I can never click next. So, for example, if… I thought it was asking me to choose all the ones, I mean, they're all relevant, right? Like, so no messages found. No messages found that's kind of maybe, yeah, actually, I should go back and redo this. Just one second. I can find sure, take your time, ones that are legit.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. But I, but I hear where you're coming from. So basically, once you gave the examples clicked on search, it pulled up emails, but then after that, it didn't give you the option to confirm that and then automation in itself.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah, exactly.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  And let me just find some.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  I wasn't sure how many I should put in, cause yeah, right. Search.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Insufficient, so.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  That's that's legit. This is legit. Cause it has it there that's legit. This is legit. And that's legit. Okay. Well, it worked now.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. I didn't do anything. I swear.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  You're amazing. Sure. Too. Humble. Okay. So close.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  This, okay. So.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  And add a step so it can.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Action extract?

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Action.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. And do is at this point, add it as a note. So that way it becomes a message on the note.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Could I add it to a custom field and create a custom field or is it better just a note?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Can you scroll? Do you have custom fields created at this point? I do think it is just with the notes.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Pin this note.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, just do me a favor. Before you do that. Do like two flower packets? Yeah. And then just save and enable on the top, right? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. There we go. Could you maybe just send a test email with one of the other ids we just used as a test just to see if it works out?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. We'll give it a couple of minutes for everything to fall in place and everything. But yeah, once it loads up, it should be fine and it should have it added as a pin note.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  So, this should be called like.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. And in the meantime, let me just double check on my environment, see if I can help you add it as a custom field instead because it does seem like that'll be more easier and straightforward.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah, but maybe there's other ways that I could like what also would be useful if I could extract phone numbers using the phone number, if I could call an API, I can get that order id, and then I could put that into the custom field because sometimes there's like if I look this one up in my system, there's going to be an order id associated with it. So eventually we're kind of thought that one doesn't… but if, yeah, if I could do that, eventually, maybe I can create a hiver Chrome extension to do that for me, but also even extracting vin numbers. Oh, we.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  can do like technically the extract if we follow the same pattern that we did right now to extract it, we can add it to a custom field as well. I just double checked on my demo environment and it showed up a custom field option, so you can technically put it on a custom field.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Nice. So, if I can extract phone numbers, vins?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  order ids, then once it's in a custom field, then it's easy for an API to find that there and use it. Is that kind of the best way to do it?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that would probably be the most simplest route if we're not, you know, if we're not going for like a direct integration and all of that drought. It's probably the most straightforward one for now.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah. Do you guys have, programmers or staff that can create that for me? Like and the… that would make it linkable to my system? My, or should I just have my developers?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, I'd say it would be mostly better if you run it through your developers only because they're from an API capability, it's going to be like, you know, the requirements in our sense and there will be an added cost depending on the complexity of it, just to make things simpler for you? I think it'll be better for your developers to start building it out and use my support team and my engineering team whenever needed for like assistance and pointers.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Awesome. Okay. No problem. Okay. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let's do an example as well.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  What's that? Oh.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I was just going to say, let's do a wind number example. Let's get a text based custom field as well and see if the whole thing falls through if you'd like to just run a quick test.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah. Can we do the custom fields for the orders, fins and phone? Yeah, great.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. So you'll have a logo on the top, right? I'd like to get the custom fields graded first.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Okay. Duplicate.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. There we go. So shared inboxes on the left side… sorry inboxes at the top… then. Yeah, mvs Canada, click through inside custom fields at the top third one perfect. Add custom field, text based bottom, right? And then, yeah, we'll just call it win number, order number, whatever. Yeah, just… yeah. So I mean, like if you look on the right side, that's what it shows up like in your Gmail hiver instance. So, if you put that as an info icon, somebody hovers over it, it'll tell you, hey, you know, this is what it does.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Oh, nice.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And then save field. When you're ready… that's it. We've got this graded. Let's do a couple more for win and phone numbers.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay, perfect. We'll go back to automations. And, yeah, I don't know where, right there. No worries. Automations create automation on the right side. New email is received, add step, extract from… subject and body, vin… number, vin, nordic yeah, training I, and same process as before we'll fill up a few examples.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Search.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  this might be the tricky piece.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah, they're all valid, I'm pretty sure, right? Because a lot of these emails have vins. Yeah. So there's only.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  three.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Three, how do I go across more?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Can you do like a two finger scroll by any chance? Does it do anything?

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  It did?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. That's it looks like a UI. Yeah.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  That's kind of, oh, there we.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  go. Oh, there we go. Yeah, I think we need to get better with that experience, but you got it.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah, that's what I was worried that's what the problem was when I did the order ids, I did 20 of them and.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I couldn't yeah, a larger list. I hear where you're coming from and I'm glad I've got that on recording as well. It makes it easier for me to feed that back to the team.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah. And you make sure you definitely put my name on the change log for the developers and reference me. And then I can get maybe a free year out of this.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  As a discoverer of the bug.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I think we can probably have you on the bug bounty, but a year might not be realistic. There we go. So that's sorted out. Okay, close, add step action, custom field. Your text based one should show up. If you scroll down a bit more, there we go win and let's do one thing. Click on the variable that icon on the bottom left there. Yeah, just select that and that's about it. It'll just pop that up, perfect.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  So, I'll go down here and I'll just do this one for a second here because I need to do this and that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let's just delete that step and switch it to the custom field because this one adds a note… yeah… order id and you probably have to do that variable thing. Again, there we go.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, the.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  format… is sometimes different. So, it's like you get phone numbers that are, let me show you here. It can be formatted in different ways like you can have them formatted in this way.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Or with like plus one and all of that, right?

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah, like there's.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  and just for now, let's maybe use just three examples so that we don't worry about the scroll on the horizontal part. Okay? Sometimes.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  They go in as this way.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  I'm just thinking here too. I can print in more of these fields here and they can pull them out.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Well, I do want to give a disclaimer that the extract as it stands right now will not be able to get, you know, like just pure alphabets and phrases and things like that, right? As per my last discussion that's what it stands at. So, for now, my recommendation would be alphanumeric purely numeric, just clear indicators or identifiers there.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Search the same process as before.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. All right. All that's left is to run a couple of tests or wait for alleged emails to show up and see if it starts filling out like the way it's supposed to.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It isn't going to be like proactive in that sense of it. It's only going to be from this point forward.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, yeah, Nick, that's the extract piece and I'm sure it's going to be like pretty fine. I will drop a note to the team to keep an eye out if, you know, have any questions on this and that you'll reach out so they know what to expect. There we go. The win number is right there on the right side. Wow. Interesting. It's the id tool link isn't.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  picking that up. Yeah, there's no id on this one to find. Oh.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Cool. Okay. Cool.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah, that's all right.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  The rain is getting fetched there we go.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  I wonder if it's going to be an issue with creating… a way to link it, you know, because it has to be, I don't know if it's a text field or if it's like, you know, how that one's linked there. I can open it up.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, as far as I'm aware, the one on the right side that we've created that's a pure text field. Okay? Yeah.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Okay. Pure text. There's. No other. Okay. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  As far as I'm aware it's not going to have any additional indentation or changes or things like that, it's just going to be regular text there.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Okay. So, fine. Yeah. Okay. Just see it's in the text box so that's okay. So then I can update my, I might even just be able to do it because all I want to do is be able to have it linkable so that's great. I'll be able to do that there.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  There's also like quite a few other AI stuff aspects within hiver, you know, I know we're running short on time. So if you want, we can probably set some time for later or I can give you like a quick two minutes and you can explore this and keep exploring it.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Quick two minutes would be fantastic.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure thing. All right. So click on AI agents under there. Yeah. So two broad angles or categories in which we're developing the AI side of hiver once the agents. And this is more focused on everyday operations, making things easier, making things simpler. At this point, you've got automatic tagging and sentiment as two main indicators. If you click on configure against tagging, you're going to be like you said, you know, before, if you want to start using it or if you want to continue building on your existing set of tags, what you'll need to do is come here, select from one of your existing tags and give the AI 10 example conversations that fall under that criteria. Okay, different areas as opposed to running automation, which is exact matches of keywords. This one's more widespread and broad stroke. So it can cover multiple scenarios even though people talk about it and say it differently. That's the basic logic, right? Okay. Perfect. Now, click on the back icon over here next to AI tagging. And if you scroll to AI co pilot instead, right at the top, that's a way where you can upload your knowledge sources, which is documents, processes, sops, all of that good stuff. Put it on hiver. And this then becomes a conversational assistant that lives inside your hiver ride panel. So if you enable it just for a split second, it should be able to show you that experience as well. Now, can you excel the whole thing? Let's go back to Gmail. Just like open any conversation, just like one email… excuse me. Anything is fine. So right now, this one is like a tracking update.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And I see there's a couple of back and forth. If you click on that sparkle, there we go. That little sparkle at the bottom. This becomes your conversational assistance. You can either ask it to summarize a reply, or you can be like, hey, draft a reply. It's going to give you three scenarios, pick one and it's going to draft a reply that becomes ready to send. So like, for instance, you know, type out one that says request price for like precise driver eta, for instance… yeah, and just like send it or enter. Yeah. So essentially what we're building here is a reply assistant or a reply writing assistant that doesn't just stop with a reply but makes it more contextual right now, you don't have any processes, documents, terms of service, things like that uploaded. But if that's all here, then this reply that you see will include all of that information and you can refine it. And if you click on insert, that becomes a draft that you can then further edit and send out. Does that make sense?

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yep. Sounds good. So, my other question there was, I'm going to be adding new inboxes?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Is.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  it going to be under here? And like still kind of be able to manage under every single one? Cause I don't want certain ones like I don't want to have four or five inboxes for just like different domains of email. So like quotes or tracking.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that's a good question. Let me switch over to my screen. So I show you what the default experience is like, right? So if you look at my screen right now, you see how I've got a stack of these running from test to support that's the usual route when you create multiple different inboxes and what that looks like now, if you don't want that to happen and you want everything to funnel into the central mvs Canada. One, what you can do is mention the email addresses as aliases. So go to your hiver, admin panel, go to shared inboxes. The one inbox you have, and literally just like type out the email addresses as aliases to the primary one. Yeah, right. That, what happens is every email sent to these different email addresses across domains, all funnel into this one inbox that you use as the primary within where you can use tags and automations to tell the difference simple automation would be, if it's to domain one, tag it a certain way, create a custom view like this and put it under there.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Okay. So I don't then have to create these shared inboxes. I just create aliases. So I won't have, okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Perfect. Yeah. So the outcome is to keep it simple, keep it consolidated and it's the same people that's going to be working on it at the end of the day, then you can just consolidate everything, put it as aliases. If you don't want the same people to see emails across the domains, then you would have to make it separate inboxes. I want to let you like make sure that that's pretty clear too.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  That's awesome.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's great. All right. And hey, if you want to like set up another time to like go over some of the other AI features in detail or talk about it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Happy to do that. As I can see, you know, you've got like 20 days left on the trial for the AI. So on the commercial front, it is a 20 dollar per user per month, paid add on over and above any existing subscription fees that you have on like your tiers. So if you'd like to continue with it, if you'd like to proceed with it, probably over the next couple of weeks, then let me know. I can, I'll see if I can add in an additional incentive just like we did for the annual switch back in July.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Okay. Let's just set up a meeting for end of the month and then or some, when you get a chance, send me the, your calendar invite, and then I'll do it again and we'll just go through any other questions I have.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. That makes total sense. Then, Nick. Hey, I'll send you an email with my calendar invite, a couple of click through articles for the whole AI feature set. Check it out for now. Tentatively putting us down for like the 20 first of November, just like two weeks from now. Do you think that works?

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Same.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Time if you're free. Actually, my 20 first is pretty open from like nine to three eastern.

Nick Madore (nick@mvscanada.ca):
  Yeah, let's just do like same time.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right, perfect. So I'll send over like a tentative 30 minutes there. You've got my meeting invite. I mean, you will have my calendar link pretty soon. So use that to reschedule, move things along and let me know if you're good to go on the 20 first. I'll quickly unlock an incentive and if it all works through, we can have it added to your subscription as well.
