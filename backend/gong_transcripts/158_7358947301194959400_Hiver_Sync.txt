Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hey, Chris. Good afternoon.

Chris Liles (chris.liles@minervavirtual.com):
  How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good. Thank you. How are you doing?

Chris Liles (chris.liles@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah, pretty good. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Hey, Chen. Thank you for connecting again.

Jen:
  Yeah, you're welcome. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. I think we're waiting for a couple of more folks to join in. So give it a couple of more minutes.

Jen:
  Yeah. I know customers are in a meeting that was due to finish at one. So I'm sure she'll be on her way.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. Yeah, until we wait for them, let me take an opportunity to understand how has it been so far with regards to the trial?

Jen:
  Yeah, from my point of view, it's been really good. Great. Yeah, we've been enjoying using it. Kirsten is the person who's using it most… but yeah, I think it's I think she's been playing around with the automation and, you know, more of the tags and things like that. So it'll be interesting to hear how she's been finding that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Yeah, we'll also ask the rest of the team on what their feedback has been so far, but I'm open to take any questions in case you have any, or how do you want to move that up ahead?

Jen:
  Yeah, I believe Kirsten does have some questions.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. No, I was just going to speak.

Jen:
  I.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  had to.

Jen:
  Go on, Chris.

Chris Liles (chris.liles@minervavirtual.com):
  I was just going to say it's definitely made us more efficient. I think it's been pretty good, yeah.

Jen:
  Bye.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, indeed. Indeed. And I could see the great progress. You've also created another inbox recruitment at the rate. So two folks are already added to this mailbox. So, essentially by staying right inside everybody's individual login, we are able to manage the recruitment inbox as well as the HR inbox, making sure that there are no emails which slip through the cracks. We have got complete visibility on whatever is happening, whoever needs to work on what sort of tasks anybody can actually go ahead and, you know, assign these tickets tasks to each other, making sure that we have a good collaboration at the end of the day. So, I'm glad I'm great. It's good to know. Let's have Kirsten in the room here. I think she's already there at the fire. So I'll let her in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hey, Kirsten, we were waiting for you. How are you doing?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Hi, good. Thank you. So sorry. I just had to deal with something quickly.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. I'm glad you could take our time, join us and yeah, Jen says she has been good with the trial experience so far. Happy with product. I do want to understand your feedback and of course, it seems like you have got questions, so we'll go ahead and answer all of those for you.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Fantastic. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. All right.

Jen:
  So, yeah, Kirsten, how have you, how have you found it? Because you've probably used it more than any of us?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah, it's still, really enjoying it. It's made things a lot smoother, a lot easier and there's much better communication I think between the team where we can just tag people and ask questions. It's been really useful. There's only a few issues or questions really that I had about it just to see if we can get it that little bit smoother. I'm happy to wait or jump right into them whichever works best.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, I can go ahead and answer all of those, I mean, and should there be any questions which are technical and out of my competencies, I can then get you the answers from my technical support. But yeah, go ahead, shoot over all the questions please.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So, I was wondering, is there any way that we can assign an email to more than one person?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Because there are some times where for example, me and Jen both need to input something to it, but I can only assign it to myself and then it won't be in the main inbox for Jen to see. So it'd be really useful if we can kind of double assign if we need to.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So the only drawback to this is, and the reason why we have kept it deliberately assignment to one individual is that we don't want the teams to be under impression on who's going to be the final owner of the ticket, who has to actually respond back to the customers. Given that it would also impact the reporting when I say the analytics on which representative has responded, how long did we take that only works upon one ownership? So this boils down to the accountability at the end of the day. However there are clear ways through which you can still have multiple people work on a common email. For an example, I'm not sure if you have looked at suredraft's feature functionality where Kristen, even if you're working on a ticket or an email, and you want Jen to be collaborative on those emails, either you can add mention Jen, and then she gets a notification on the note chat box and she can reply to the comments or you could just simply draft a reply, save that draft. And Jen will be able to see that draft in the drafts saved option itself. Do you want to share your screen? I can show that to you that's a better way to collaborate between multiple folks on the team?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Completely understood. There are definitely ways around that then that we can use. So another question I had is about the spam folder. So obviously when we were in the actual HR inbox, we could check the spam folder each day, each week, whatever. But now that it's in our own inboxes, I've not found any way to access that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. The basic functionality that Gmail has to offer in terms of flagging those spammed emails are still going to happen exactly the way it is managed outside hiver also, which means even if these emails are still spammed by your existing Gmail workflow, those emails are still being flagged as spam, you might just want to log in into your HR inbox once in a while in a month or a week to just find out all the ones which are appropriately spammed, and all of that. Or you just want to make sure that nothing is actually spammed, which essentially should not be because it's again at the end of the day, hiver does not control spam, it's Gmail that runs the algorithms on spams, right? Apart from that, if you tell me that there are certain emails that are still received in your inbox for your recruitment or HR, but these are essentially spams, I can go ahead and help you with certain automation workflows and say, hey, these emails should never be inside our HR inbox or recruitment inbox. These are like a sure shot spam, which Gmail somehow has failed to kind of flag those spams. But like I say, at the end of the day, hiver does not control spamming, it is still your existing Gmail workflow that is remain untouched. It is still working the way it is actually. And to be able to just look at those spams, you might just want to log in into HR inbox once in a while to see all of that. Otherwise you don't even need to do that?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Okay. So there's no way to add the spam folder into my own inbox with the HR section is basically what I was trying to gauge.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Is it because out of curiosity, you always check the spam folder or do you notice a pattern in the past that there are certain emails that were flagged spam which ideally should have not been. And I.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  used to when we were in the HR inbox itself, I would check the spam regularly because we have a lot of new employees. Their email addresses might go straight to spam. It's just one of those things that a lot of people reach out to us. Sometimes we need to see them and they're flagged as spam and there's no way to specifically mark those emails as safe because it's always a new email address, a new member of staff, things like that.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. If you could just give me maybe another minute or two, let me quickly check with my support engineers. If there is a way to have a spam folder specifically just for you to kind of just have a quick glance on it, not necessarily that the entire team would want to do that because then it may confuse everybody. I mean, it's just like probably if you could have a quick check at it, that would be great. So, let me check with my team. Give me a minute, please. In the meanwhile, you can go ahead with the second question. But yeah, let me go ahead and check this with my support folks.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah, no problem at all. So, my next question was about the tag names. So when I create a tag name, I found that I can't then edit what it's called. So I put something as compliance. I wanted to change it to compliance slash policies, but I couldn't find any way to amend what the tag was called. So, I just wondered if there is any way to do that. I went through all of the settings and I just, it just didn't seem to be anywhere. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Basically, it's editing the tags that you're referring to.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Just the.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Tag names. Could you share your screen? Please, let me just quickly walk you through that.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah. Let me just.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Okay. So, sorry, just find an email.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Are you able to see my screen?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, thank you.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Wonderful. Okay. So we've got all the tags on here.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, basically, let's say, let's take an example of. Do you mind just creating a tag called hiver test? Let's just quickly create a tag hiver test on the top. Yeah. Okay. Let's go ahead and click that, use any color of your choice and do done. Okay. Now that we have created a tag on the fly, you can apply this that's okay. We can always come back and remove the tag.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah, sorry?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right now, if you notice there is a tagging option here at the bottom of all views, could you take me to these tags here? Like, okay, now here, can you search for hiver test tag?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Just search that. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Now, could you hover around here? You should have three dots? Yeah. Can you click on these three dots, edit the tag? Yeah. So I'll tell you the reason you must be doing. Yeah. Okay. Now because you essentially come to the tags option to create tags, but there's another way to create tags on the emails on the fly where you don't have to go back to the tags, create the one and apply, you can just create an apply tag right from there itself. Now, if you need to edit it, change the color, change the context of the tag as to why you want to automatically add those, you can always come back and maybe, you know, edit it right there. So you have an option to do that inside the tags window.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  That's fantastic. Thank you. I don't know how I didn't see that bit.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. All right. I can take your next question then.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  So this one's a bit of a complex one we were discussing earlier that it would be really helpful. So just to give you some context, Jen is part time. So sometimes the emails assigned to her won't always be seen and responded to straight away. So we were discussing if there would be any kind of way that we could get an automatic reply set up for anything that gets assigned to Jen. So as soon as it's assigned to her, there's an automatic email goes out to the person that reached out just to say her working days are such and such, there may be a delay in response.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Absolutely, we can look into certain workflow. I've got Aishwarya with me. She's from support and let me quickly give her a quick use case example and we can find out a way to do that. Aishwarya. The only context here is Jen is a part time employee. Anytime we happen to assign her an email or she picks up an email wherever there is an email ownership to her. If there is a way we could trigger a quick notification to the customer stating, hey, we are working on the request and we should be getting in touch with you as soon as possible or Kristen, is there anything in specific you want to send across to the customer?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  No, that's pretty much perfect. Just we'd want to include Jen's working days just so they understand.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. And also, it would be helpful if you could add mention or tag somebody else, maybe Kristen internally on the notes that this is Jen's ownership. The email notification is already sent out to the customer. This is just for your information, fyi that's all.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  That can be done using the automation. So, for example, there are two automations for this case. You'll have to set up one where an incoming email has come in and it has been assigned to Jen. Then an automatic email should be triggered to the customer. A notification should be sent to Kristen. Second automation would be needed to be set up where if any email is assigned manually to Jen, then the automated response should be.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  triggered and everything. So both ways, it's possible, Kristen, either you assign an email manually or it gets automatically assigned to Jen, as long as the ownership says it's Jennifer, we trigger a quick notification to the customer with whatever message you want to send across. Do you want me to help you with that? Do you want to test it on a couple of emails?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah, that would be fantastic. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. I would urge you to share your screen again and let me just quickly get you through there.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Oh, yeah, no problem.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. And in the meanwhile, you're doing that Kristen, Aishwarya. There was another question with regards to management of spam emails. Okay. So before hiver, Chris was actually logging into HR inbox and recruitment inbox, just to try and find out the spam folders and see if there is anything which is unattended which is maybe spammed or flagged inappropriately. So she had an access to it. Now with hiver because we don't need to necessarily log in into HR inbox, we're trying to find out if there is a way to look at the spam still somehow in the individual inbox, if there is a way to just have Kristen look at all the spams or still if she can manage it without having to log in into HR inbox separately. I failed to give a use case solution because I knew for a fact that we don't need to log in into HR inbox, or my customers predominantly look at once in a blue moon. But in the HR inbox use case, imagine anybody from anywhere in the world could contact us with regards to a new application for job and the emails could be hotmail. Com could be xyz? Com could be anything, right? So there's no way we could ignore this spam functionality. So, is there a recommendation? What should be the best way to go about it now? I know I confused you with two different use cases. You can always take your time. We can fix the very first with the automations and come back to the spam one.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Sure. Just one quick thing. There are filters within the source Gmail account which are stopping those emails to come into the shared inbox due to those spam filters, right? If we remove those spam filters, ideally every single email will come in hiver. And using the automations, those spam emails can be auto closed, so that every email will come in the shared inbox. Everything can be tracked in the shared inbox, while the unwanted emails can be auto closed.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, I'll explain that to you, Kristen. If that's not clear, yeah, go ahead, please.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  It sounds like it could be useful, but if they're auto closing, then we still won't see them. So I think that would potentially be the same problem. I just basically, I just wondered if there was a way to get a little subfolder here for.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  the spam, so.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  I could just manually go through it, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It would be now, exactly. I'll explain that to you Kristen. For an example, we create a tag called no action needed. And those could be those emails where hiver understand that these are spams potentially and these close automatically for you. But you're still not going to lose the context because right below your all views, you would, when you click on all views, can you do that for me? Please? Can you click on, yeah, now right there, do you see overdue pending closed? Due soon? There could be another view that says no action needed slash spam. Now, if those emails are automatically tagged by hiver and we open the gatekeeper at the back end that Gmail does not spam anything for you. Everything should route to HR. And we deliberately look at these emails and understand if these needed our attention or not. And hiver spam those emails or flag those emails and auto close it, you will still have an option to go look at no action and spam needed emails and look at those ones. If you still need to work on it by default, those will be closed, but you can always respond back to those emails, open the context and assign it to the teammates. You're not going to be losing any context by the way. So you'll have an have a complete view on those closed emails even though these are marked spammed by hiver automations.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah, that actually sounds really good as long as they're in their own folder and I can go through them, that would be perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And should your team doesn't need to go through that folder, we can even keep it private to yourself. We would want them to keep working on the way they want. It. Let's not even confuse the team, but you can keep this folder private to yourself.

Jen:
  Would it adjust the analytics at all? If we did that? Would it affect the analytics?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, it would not because those are, yeah, we can always run the analytics saying anything that we do want to look at the response time, the reports, it should always eliminate the tag called spam or no action needed. So we could always look at it in a way that we don't require reporting on these emails because these are predominantly categorized as no action needed.

Jen:
  Yeah, it would not. I'm just wondering, yeah, I think we might need to discuss that one a little bit more. And I'd like to, I've got a few thoughts, but that might be for our team to discuss, I think.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. The answer to your questions are, yes, we are absolutely okay to do that. There are multiple ways to do it however it finds appropriate to your use case. I'm happy to set that up for you. But with regards to your automations on any email, when assigned to Jen as a part time or ad hoc user, let me help you with that, Chris. Can you take me to the admin panel, please? Yeah, the settings, hiver, settings, admin panel. Yeah, shared inboxes. Okay. HR inbox, automation workflows. Do you see this fourth option there? Okay?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Automation workflows? Oh, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  These are the automations. Okay. Yeah. And now, let's create a new one.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Instead of number four, I would say, give it a name, Jen, just give a reference to this automation. Yeah, wherever the new email is coming in, add a step.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  If condition is, yeah, click on if please select condition is assigned to Jen… to email?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Oh, sorry. I didn't realize. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any of?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Aishwarya. Is that the right way to go about it?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Yes. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And this is where we need to put Jen's email address.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  No, the shared inbox address because it's going to be addressed to the shared inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Let's put in HR at the rate inbox email address.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  So, Jen, would the emails really be addressed to the HR inbox or to your address as well?

Jen:
  Well, these ones, would they'd get my out of office? If they just went to my personal inbox? This is just for the, for somebody emailing in HR, but then it would be assigned to me if it was because I look after wellbeing. So, if it was a wellbeing thing, I guess Kirsten would tag it for me, but I might not be in for a few days. What we don't want to do is have that person left wondering if they've if their email has been received. And we also don't want it to affect our analytics of our first response time.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Makes sense. Perfect. Alrighty. In that case, we can move ahead with the automation to email is set up. Perfect. Scroll down a little bit, Kirsten… and let's add another step. Is this then add an action?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  You should see an option. It says send a reply. Yeah… perfect. And let's add the, so the content of the reply that you want to send it to the customer, you need to add it over here.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah, I'll just pop in test for now, cause we'll come back to that later.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Sure. Let's click on save. Perfect. Add another step… action… over here. Let's select it to send a notification, try scrolling downwards. Yes, send notification, add your name over here. Perfect. Do you want to also add a small little note for yourself or a notification should be sufficient?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Sure.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Okay. Perfect. In that case, let's add another step. Then… action… over here. You can add a note. Perfect. So at the rate, mention yourselves or it's not needed, right? Yeah, it's not needed. Just a note.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But Aishwarya, are we missing on something that says, particularly, this email is assigned to Jen. And only then we are triggering these automations, like these workflows?

Aishwarya Uppal:
  No, that's that automated email Rakesh, that's different. I mean, this is just a test. This is just a note, right?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, but basically.

Chris Liles (chris.liles@minervavirtual.com):
  If you go back up to the top wasn't that the first thing we said that if we were assigning to Jen.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. At the minute, it's just sending out to everything that comes in into the HR inbox. So the ask here is, yeah, we need to be assigned to Jen, so.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  Sorry, we missed the main step itself to assign it to Jen. No worries. We can add another action as well.

Jen:
  But then we wouldn't want it to send out every time something gets assigned to me. If it's a work, if I am in work.

Chris Liles (chris.liles@minervavirtual.com):
  Oh, I think we can do for all of them actually if we're able to do it, could we not just send out a thank you for your email?

Chris Liles (chris.liles@minervavirtual.com):
  And we aim to respond within 24 hours if it's one of us. And then for you just be able to respond as soon as possible, please note that we work part time. I think that's probably just good practice isn't it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's just the only.

Jen:
  time we could do on Gmail isn't it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Oh, the autoresponders can actually help here, finding out a way to autorespond these customers during the business hours and outside the business hours. Now, it is irrespective of Jen, your login or Kristen's login. It is a general practice otherwise also that the customers are aware that if they're contacting you from nine to five, this is a typical time duration that we get back to them. Or otherwise if they're contacting us, post working hours, this is what they're expecting. They revert within these many hours. So, I think that's a better approach than an individual who is, who has been assigned to, because otherwise, what I can think of is if I keep the team availability and you have the option to keep yourself away for the tickets that you don't want to work on, nothing will be assigned to you. That will be even better approach where nothing is assigned to you when you are, when you are absent or when you are away, it would rather go to the common pool of unassigned tickets. And that's where the folks who are already in would be much better folks to kind of just reply to those ones immediately. But having said that, I believe setting up the business hours and autoresponders, are much better approach here in this use case.

Jen:
  Yeah. And I think, you know, if it was, it might be, it might be nicer to have a personal touch anyway. If there was somebody coming in for a well being thing, then maybe we could set up an email template. So it doesn't take very long to do. But there is a couple of still manual. Maybe Kirsten sends an email template which says we've got your email, Jen's not in until, you know, and it says the same thing if.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's the case. We can automatically trigger this. When Kristen realizes that this email needs a template, she would use a tag called Jen's auto template. Let's say we create a tag called Jen's auto template. The moment Kristen adds that tag onto the email, it triggers the quick notification to the customer stating Jen is not in. We would wait for a couple of more minutes or an hour. We'll personally look into your request and get back to you something on those lines, but we are deliberately choosing the activity here. It's not happening on all the emails. By the way, it is basically happening on when Jen is not in, Kristen is aware and she wants to send out this notification, but she doesn't have to type in every time. She would just add a tag on this email and it goes automatically to the customers if that works out for you.

Jen:
  Yeah. Well, we'll have a chat I think outside of this meeting, but it's good to know that there's other options as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, definitely. The very much recommended is the business templates which are autoresponders for nine to five and post five or whatever the business hours are outside the working hours. Second is we deliberately choose a template as in when Kristen feels that this has to go out for Jen on behalf of Jen, she adds a tag and it quickly triggers a notification. Or the third option could be any time email is assigned to you, Jen. And if these emails do get assigned to you outside the working hours and you can define the working hours by the way in the same workflows. And that's when you want to trigger the notification automations. I mean, I could think of multiple other ways also.

Jen:
  Yeah… cool. Thank you. Correct.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Me. If I'm wrong, Aishwarya. I mean, your technical nature, I'm sure you would have better ideas.

Aishwarya Uppal:
  No, you're on the right path, Rakesh. I mean, all the three ways work according to, I mean, if Jen and everyone else is okay with it, we can set it up or you can discuss it internally and let us know. Yeah.

Chris Liles (chris.liles@minervavirtual.com):
  Yeah.

Jen:
  Cool. Yeah, I think we just, we won't discuss it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, sure. Yeah. The answer to your question is, yes, it is absolutely possible to manage the spams, manage the autoresponders on Jen's assignment. But one thing for sure that you, that I would recommend you look at it is something to do with the teams availability, which I don't think you have looked at it yet. If you could just leave this one here, could you take me to the settings here? Yeah. And then look at the feature access. There should be something like something called out… of office. Could you turn this on? The very first option that you see on the top out of office? Now, when you have turned on the out of office? Yeah. So you can. Yeah, absolutely. Now, you are allowing your agents to toggle on and off the moment they log in into Gmail, and they start to work on tickets. Now. Let's say if Jen logs out early or she only logs in for four hours, anytime she works on the ticket, and she marks herself away, she would get an option to just unassign the emails. Next time there's a response, it goes to a common pool. And then you have complete visibility on which email has gotten a response that does not get assigned to Jen.

Jen:
  Oh, that would be good cause I went on a holiday last week and I manually reassigned them all.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Ah, yeah. In that case, we did not need to do that. We could have. Okay. Yeah, if you notice this green button on the top, do you see the human availability? Let me just quickly annotate. Now. You can come back to the main Gmail screen. You can close down this admin panel, maybe just come back to the main Gmail screen. Okay. Now, do you see this availability option here? Yeah. Now, if you're offline or you're going to be away for scheduling for a couple of more days, you can always set yourself away until. And… if you click on this on the, yeah, now this is where you can set up your away schedule… your personal autoresponder that, hey, I'm going to be away and you can always choose to unassign the conversation even if you worked up upon those emails in the past, but new responses do not get assigned to you and it could go to the unassigned pool for the rest of the folks to pick that up because the email by default will still have the entire thread added to it. Otherwise, for regular day basis, I would say if you click again on the same human icon, ma'am that's… where you can go ahead and just keep yourself away for logging out. I would just toggle that off. And I would say if in my absence anything comes in, I would just simply go ahead and unassign those emails to myself.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. But otherwise, also even if I don't unassign conversations and I just simply keep myself away, Kristin, and your team would definitely get an idea because when we work on these emails and you have the entire user list, that user is not showing online. I mean, it does not appear to be online as a green button right there. For an example, if you open the email, maybe this test email… could you open this one? Yeah. Now, the activity panel here now from here itself, I mean the assignment, you should see a clear, yeah, you see these red buttons, right? I mean, these green button that says everybody's online. Now, if Jen is away, you would have a grid down here. So you would definitely see that the person is not even working today or maybe away for some breaks or whatever.

Jen:
  Okay. That's great. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And if somebody is taking a deliberate one week off or whatever it is, then the schedule could be out of office and the emails won't be assigned to those representatives automatically.

Jen:
  Okay. So, I can see that working well for like holidays rather than my like non working days because we'd still want to be able to assign something for me for when I come back in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because yours is not very definite, right? Because yours is more like on a very subjective hours, whether or not you're working maybe given a full day or you want to just work on a couple of hours in a day, you can always choose to toggle your working hours.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But for the entire team, if these are regular working hours, if these are national holidays, we can set up the business template and say we don't work on Saturdays and Sundays. We don't work on national holidays. We don't work on independence days and all of that. That could be proclaimed inside the settings and it would work for everybody. And then your users would be notified. Your customers would be notified that we're not working today.

Jen:
  Okay. Yeah. I also had a question about what shows the folders underneath HR, when you click on all views and then you can see pending and closed emails. Would it be possible to move pending up so that we can see it on that first page?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  There is a star button. Yeah, absolutely. Great. You have an option to favorite those stars and you want to keep those on the top of your screen. Yes, you can do that.

Jen:
  And is that individual to each of us? So if Kirsten?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Did.

Jen:
  want that on her view?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Kristen works on escalations versus Jen works on regular emails versus Chris works on only refunds. You can choose to see what email view is absolutely important instead of just having all ducks in one row. Yeah, absolutely.

Jen:
  Yeah, great. Because I had made some emails pending and I hadn't seen that all views and I was like, where's the pending gone? But now that's answered it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Not only your unassigned mind team, but even if there are certain emails with the specific tags, you can simply go ahead and use a quick view to tag those emails and look at those emails in that specific customized view. For an example, Kristen, can you help me with this? All views section once? Okay. Now, could you help me create a quick view here? I mean, could you click on the plus button on the top? Okay? Create a view? Now, for an example, Kristen wants to find out all the emails which are with regards to hivertest. All she would do is select assignee, all, can you click here again and say all select all? Yeah, select all on the top? Okay, apply. And then emails either are open pending or closed or whatever that status of the email is open or pending? Because closed is, anyways, the one which are done. So maybe any email which is open and pending has a very specific tag called hivertest. Remember, we created a tag just for testing emails. Yeah. So you can go ahead and say, yeah, contain hivertest, scroll it down and.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  it's not letting me scroll down to press apply.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You should be able to scroll this window down, are you not?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  It's not doing anything?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We.

Jen:
  understand what you mean?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Then you can save this view on the top. Okay. Yeah. Now you get an option to… okay, I think you need to scroll it all the way down once you're done. Yeah.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  I understand it's not doing anything. When I scroll, it's not moving. I'm scrolling right now. It's not moving is.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It because you're sharing your screen and I'm actually annotating on top of it could be a reason because zoom does sometimes act upon it. Okay, never mind, you know, what you can do is you can just save it rather than from the top. Once you apply those tags and conditions, you get an option to save that and give it a view. These are the test emails. These are the hivertest emails and it could be something to do with anything and any tag you create, it could be absence. It could be, you know, recruitments that's how you could create those very specific views for those category of emails that would then land into those specific, you know, customized views for yourself. Yeah, you can save it. We can always delete the view. It's just that how that would actually appear in your inbox right below the do soon, you see these test emails. Now, these could be the recruitment emails because you're classifying those emails with a specific tag or the custom field also right from the dropdown that you have created, right? AI sentiment or whatever?

Jen:
  Yeah, that would be good. Like when we've made specific labels in the past for a particular project.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, exactly. Yeah. I could have said that in a layman, yeah, as long as you use labels and you use folders with those labels, hiver can absolutely do the same with customized views and tags on it.

Jen:
  Okay. Wow. It can do a lot. Can't it? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, man, of course. I don't want to confuse you guys. Your use cases are pretty simple and we wanted to keep it simple for you. But yeah, as long as you have got more complicated questions, feel free to send that across to me. But yeah, I mean, the answer to your question so far is, yes, go ahead, discuss this internally. How do you want to manage the spams? I'm really happy to assist you with spam email management as well as the automations on outside the working hours as well. That also is doable. So, yeah.

Jen:
  To Kirsten, did you have any more questions? Sorry, I jumped in with my question, no.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  No, that was everything for me.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Lovely. What do you think is the next step from here now?

Jen:
  I think the next step will be to speak to our manager and get a budget approved for this. So, thank you for sending over the pricing earlier. And if, you know, please do, let us know if there are any special offers.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Now, with regards to the current plan, I think we are okay to look at the very basic one to begin with because as long as you need the automations workflow, like we discussed, if you want to add a tag and it should trigger an email automation, those are the advanced functionalities.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But if we are okay to live without it, the way we are currently managing the workflows, I could literally see the basic growth plan which is 25 dollars per login. Is pretty much okay with all the boxes that it does take for you guys. You can manage two inbox. I mean, rather three inboxes within it. You already have HR, you have recruitment. You still can create one more inbox and add more folks to it. And the special offer that I can do is now we offer a dedicated onboarding and team training support in our pro subscription, but I can include that in growth with no extra cost to it. So that's one there that can help you with the handholding of things. Of course, I can have a dedicated account manager to look into the team trainings and everything and recommend the best ways to utilize the solution to make sure everybody gets adopted to the platform in no time. So that's something that I can do for you. And, yeah, I mean, as long as you talk to your management and your boss and see if there are certain budgets in place, I can even look into those budgets. But, yeah, this looks like a straightforward pricing, 125 dollars. Yeah, that's pretty much it.

Jen:
  Yeah. Okay. I mean, it might be, sorry, Kirsten. Sorry?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  On the basic plan, we don't have the automatic tagging and assigning.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, that is a part of the next plan which is automatic tagging and assigning. Is still there. I mean, by the way, these are the automations, I was referring to the automatic sending out the notifications when you apply a tag called Jen's absence. And then on basis of adding a tag, you want to trigger certain notifications. So those are the advanced one. But otherwise, if you want to just automatically tag an email, assign an email, you want to automatically respond to a reply that is doable. Those are the basic automations. By the way, you do have options for the basic automations that you're already using today?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Fantastic. Thank you. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. Now, I see that the trial was extended until the ninth. We've got weekend coming in. What I would love to do is probably extend it for a couple of more days. And if we could reconnect on Monday by then, we'll have a better idea after you speak to your management. Does that sound good?

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  Yep. Yeah. I think we should be able to get a response by then an answer on the budget.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Your trial is extended for two more days. So that is active until Tuesday and let's aim to reconnect maybe just for a quick 10 minutes on Monday, around the same timing, if that's not too much to ask.

Jen:
  What type of support is there once we start paying? If we have, because I'm sure we will have ongoing questions and best ways of doing things. Yeah, what support is available?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Now, for the beginning, once we onboard, you help you set up your account, rectification of your account and team training and onboarding, think about for about weeks or months time. That is a typical timeframe. A lot of customers do need assistance with the handholding, you would have a dedicated support from me. And then another onboarding manager. Let's say post one month if everything looks good. And once in a while, we come across more questions. We have got support which is 24 or seven. So, Aishwarya joining us from support team. So even right from, your hiver, you have got an option to chat with us. So that support is 24 or seven. Now, we do have an SLA of no more than four hours on emails. We get back to the customers and chat support is no more than five seconds. So at any point in time during your Sunday breakfast, you think about hiver, you come across a question. We are online.

Jen:
  Did you say five seconds?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, I said five seconds and that's literally less than that. Wow. Yeah, no, I mean, we take pride in the support that we offer. I mean, we are, very serious about the support that we offer to our customers and this has been.

Jen:
  We need to pull our socks up a bit. Five seconds. Wow. Okay. And that's included in the price that we pay? Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You don't have to pay extra for it. Okay?

Jen:
  Excellent. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. All right. Can I go ahead and extend an invite to reconnect on Monday for about just 10 minutes?

Jen:
  Yeah.

Kirsten Swan (kirsten.swan@minervavirtual.com):
  It could be slightly later, we have a meeting ending at one which could run over. So if it could be more two o'clock I think would be ideal.

Jen:
  Okay. I've got a meeting at two. Hang on.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me know what?

Jen:
  Time it is maybe 145?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me check that. Give me one minute please?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we can do 145. Absolutely. Can we go ahead and let Aishwarya go off unless we have any technical questions. I think she's also waiting for other customers.

Jen:
  Oh, yeah, no, no technical questions.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. No worries. Thank you, Aishwarya. I've got this now. Thank you for your help. Most welcome. Bye, bye bye.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, I'm keeping it for 15 minutes unless we have more questions, we can always keep more buffer time, but, yeah, that should be good enough for us. And I'm sending an invite for November the tenth, which is Monday at 145.

Jen:
  Brilliant.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you. It's already out. You should have that.

Jen:
  Oh, yeah. It just needs to be coming… at 1,215.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me check that. Yeah… Okay. Yeah, that's my bounce.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right… Jen, I've sent that to you. I'm going to be inviting rest of the folks also. Do you see the timing right this time around?

Jen:
  Let me just, I was just reloading sure because it looked like it had gone in on the Tuesday instead of the Monday. Oh, no, yeah, that was why I was reloading. Yep, it's perfect now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. So, I'm also adding rest of the folks to the meeting now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Thank you so much for your time, guys. And again, like I always say, if you come across any more questions, you don't have to literally wait for technical support. You can always write back to me. I'm just an email away for you. And yeah, more than happy to help you with this evaluation.

Jen:
  Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Thank you so much. All right.

Jen:
  Thanks for your time, bye.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Bye bye.
