================================================================================

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  hey, how's it going? Adam? How goes it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good. How are you?

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Not too bad.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice. I appreciate you hopping on the call here today?

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Yeah, absolutely.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But just to set a quick agenda, Adam, and hop into it, we'd love to do a quick round of introductions, you know, understand your role. What got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demo, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps.

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Yeah, I think that's great VP of operations here at carrot. I oversee all of the member success and customer success tools systems and data relative to their operational processes. This includes the CRM tools that both teams are using csat tools. You name it. So relative to hiver. This is definitely something that falls into my domain overall?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Gotcha. And just to introduce myself, my name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver, been in the email management, customer experience space for a little over six years now, but just to understand further how you're providing, you know, success today, like what tools are you leveraging to manage that like experience for your, you know, clients?

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Yeah. Currently, we've got Zendesk in play from a CRM perspective. We're leveraging ask nicely for csat given that Zendesk doesn't meet that expectation… we've got fivenine as our telephony tool, and then community… as our workforce and capacity planning solution.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And curious about like the email client that you're leveraging today, are you using outlook or Google workspace?

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  With regards to supporting members neither?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Neither. Okay. So you're not doing any email support today, you know, through Google or outlook. It's all funneling through Zendesk. Like how are like, you know, how do people submit tickets today? Is it through like a customer portal? What does that look like?

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Yeah. On the member success side, so closely attuned to customer support, our… members have access to a portal and within that portal, just online account, they have the ability to submit requests that leverage the Zendesk apis and push tickets directly into our system so the agents can support. And then standard probably similar to hiver, we have a standalone support email that redirects emails into the platform for agents to support.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yep. And how long have you been on Zendesk? Are you in like a long term relationship with them? Would love to just kind of understand that as well?

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  It's a good question. We have been with Zendesk for about eight years at this point, but we performed a deep analysis about a year ago on various CRM platforms and we're coming up on an additional re evaluation in the near term. I think summer of next year. So really not too far, which is why I wanted to take the conversation and see what y'all are offering.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Perfect. No, I appreciate that. That's super helpful. So I can share my screen real quick and just give you like a couple slides of our background as a company, and then we'll hop into a product demonstration itself. Okay? But let me just share this real quick. So, you know, hiver is like an AI customer service platform and… you know, we've been around for over seven years, have 27,000,000 funding to date and over 2000 paid customers across the world. And, you know, we're pretty agnostic in terms of who we can work with. You know, we work with manufacturing companies, financial services, healthcare technology, you know, providing customer support, email management, whatever it might be. And, you know, we are really just helping teams by providing a place for automation, a place to leverage AI and provide analytics to provide more efficient and personalized experiences at scale. So before I hop into the demonstration here, so you said you're not. So you're not like you don't have like a personal work email that you're logging into outlook or Gmail today, like neither one of those that you're leveraging.

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  we have a standalone Gmail account that's tied to our CRM. So essentially any email that's sent to that is going into our CRM tool. But no, we don't have agents who are standalone responding on one by one basis in their Gmail. It's not, it's not best for us to do that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For sure, but you yourself, Adam have your personal co, fertility Gmail that you log into for your personal work emails and stuff like that.

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Everyone does at their organization. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got. It. Just wanted to confirm that. So I'll hop into the product demonstration real quick. So let me share my screen.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So taking a look at my screen here and, you know, one of the differentiators of Zendesk off the bat is that we are built within the Google workspace. So we're not like a standalone platform where you're going to log into a separate application. We're bringing all this customer service capabilities right within that familiar environment and going to, you know, the admin panel here. This is where we're going to set up hiver, you know, set up the channels that we can engage with our clients. So whether that's over email chat, whatsapp voice, we do provide a knowledge base for internal external purposes as well as a customer portal for, you know, members to submit tickets, track where they are in status and things of that nature. So these are the different ways that we can engage with our clients. And then this is where we'll set up the other portions of the platform, whether it's our AI capabilities, automation, service level agreements or, you know, apps that we have integrated into the platform to pull in data. So this is the whole back end of hiver. And then on the left hand side are the channels that we're going to be leveraging. So, you know, customer support, shared mailbox, this is our whatsapp channel. This is our sales chat that could be hosted on the website and then also our phone integration. So we do work with air call and we can make and receive calls at the Google workspace from a contact center perspective.

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Do you have other… telephony tools that integrate with your structure?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So right now, it's just air call. We are looking into other ones like dialpad, ujet, some of those other phone providers, but currently just air call. Okay. Are you guys doing phone support? Is it just Zendesk talk? Or is it you have another provider?

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Yeah, we do offer phone support. We are leveraging fivenine right now. We used to be on Zendesk talk, but it's a bit infant relative to our business needs. So that might actually be a bit of an unfortunate downside for hiver.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think 100 percent, I mean, right now, we just don't have that ability to integrate with fivenine. Okay. And I don't believe that's on the roadmap but something that I can definitely give the feedback to my team.

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think I can keep you posted, you know, as our product develops, you know, when it comes from like a phone integration perspective, but like fivenine, you are tied to it, like there's no room for evaluation from your phone provider today.

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  I'm sorry, say that again, I missed that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So you're definitely like you're happy with fivenine like you wouldn't look at another phone provider like Aircall, like you're happy with fivenine.

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  we just moved into a multi year contract with them. So even if we wanted to, it wouldn't be for some time.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Perfect. Well, I appreciate, you know, Adam, taking the time to meet with me here today. Totally understand. We have some, you know, integration issues with fivenine today, but we'll definitely give this product feedback to my team and keep you posted as we develop over here.

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Okay. Yeah, I'd appreciate that. I mean, like I said, if anything comes to be over the next couple months, three to four months specifically about that integration, we'd love to understand as we reenter our analysis this summer.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. I'll definitely keep you informed on that, but it was great to meet you and I'll be in touch shortly.

Adam Zook (adam@get-carrot.com):
  Awesome. Thanks a bunch. I appreciate it. Hope you have a great weekend.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you too. Take care. Okay. Bye bye.
