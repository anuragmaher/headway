Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Zoey. This is matt with hiver. Can you hear me? Yes. Sorry.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  About being a little bit late there. No.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Problem. Just with the holidays coming up here. Just wanted to make sure you were still joining here. So appreciate it. Yes. Awesome. Well, the agenda for the call today, wanted to just spend the first couple minutes or so getting an understanding of what you're looking for, helping you determine if hiver can fit your needs. And then from there, I can walk through the product and answer any questions that you have. Does that sound good?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Absolutely.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. Well, if you could start tell me a little bit about what motivated you to book this call.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Sure. So, I work as a general manager for miracle method, and the owners of this store also own six other locations and they are acquiring additional. I currently manage about four inboxes that, you know, email inboxes through outlook. And I was looking for a way to kind of organize maybe a ticketing system like an internal, only not something that would be external, a way to manage communication through all the emails that are also going to continue because I'm going to be assisting with one of the newer locations that is opening up in San Jose. So, just trying to find a way to streamline all of the email communications internally.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Absolutely. That's exactly what hiver does helps you easily streamline these inboxes that you have. And is it just you who handles these inboxes or how many people would need access to these emails? It?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Would be up to one, two, three, four… it would be anywhere from five to eight individuals.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Five to eight people, four inboxes, four?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Inboxes is what's right now, we're probably going to increase that by two. So up to six inboxes, probably. Okay. Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then, okay, up to six inboxes, five to eight people, and what's… your timeline? Like, when were you hoping to have something like this set up? I.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  mean, I would say within the next 30 days, it's not super pressing it's kind of like a… preference to have versus a must have, you know, I'm really big on efficiencies. And if I can help kind of manage some of that streamlining, then I'd like to take advantage of it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Great. Sounds good. Yeah, I mean, based on what you're looking for, definitely sounds that hiver would be a good fit. So I'm going to go ahead and share my screen. Can you see it? Yes, awesome. Let me get back in here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, just to give you a little quick background about hiver here… you know, we're you know, an AI email management help desk platform. We have over 200 employees. We have over 10,000 customers in over 50 countries with teams using our platform ranging from small businesses all the way up to some of the largest enterprises in the world, companies like capital one and openai. We also have teams that, you know, have five users, and we also have teams that have over a 1,000 plus users. So it's you know, the reason people like hiver is that it's fairly easy to use, but it's also very scalable and could be quite powerful as well. Okay. So if you basically, you're just going to go to our, the web platform here and you just log in using your Microsoft credentials. And then what you're going to see on the left hand side here is you're going to see these folders and each of these folders is going to be tied to one of those addresses that you have.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Okay. Right.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, you can have them all separate or if it made sense, you can also have multiple addresses connected to one folder. If it's like just the same kind of workflow that's kind of up to you. Are they, do they have like different people handling them? They're different. You want to keep them separate? Probably, are they separate locations or?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  So, yes and no, we have a few inboxes per location.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah. And what are the inboxes like? Is it like support? Is it like billing questions and everything or we?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Have like all of our employees have their individual email inboxes that our CRM is tied to. So sometimes they get replies from communication… sent from our CRM. And then we have the general mailbox that is kind of like a support mailbox for external use?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah. Got it. And you said this was for internal or external communications? I forgot.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  This is going to be for internal.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. But the.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  inbox is like… well, I guess I don't know really, we could potentially use it for external. We communicate obviously externally, but I would like to streamline it internally. Does that make sense? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely, honestly, whether it's internal external, both doesn't really matter. Okay. Yeah. So it's up to you exactly. It'll make sense once I walk through it here. So basically, yeah, you'll connect. The different folders will be connected to the different address, shared addresses that you have. And then you choose who has access to each folder. Okay, right? And it could be, you know, maybe you want to give everyone access to all the folders or, you know, just one, some people only need access to some to the folders. So that's up to you as well. So you choose who has access to each folder. Okay? And then how it works is basically let's just take this operations. One, let's just pretend this was operations at miraclemethod. Com. Every single time somebody emails that address, it's going to land in this folder. Okay? And when you open these emails up now, so actually, I'm just going to move this here. So every time somebody emails that email, it's going to land in the unassigned folder. Okay? So that lets, you know, okay, these emails start in the unassigned folder. No one's been assigned it. We need to work. We need to get this assigned to somebody. And when you open this email, now, you're now going to have this ticketing panel on the right hand side. So essentially, what hiver does is it just takes these emails and just turns them into tickets for you, right?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Okay. And then,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  with this panel here, you can now assign it to each other. Okay? So an email comes in, I'm going to go ahead and assign this to matt. Matt is going to get notified. There's a bell icon here in hiver. And then everyone's going to have their own mind folder as well where they can see all the emails that have been assigned to them. Okay. And there's also an assigned to me folder here, which if you have multiple folders, you can easily see, okay across all the folders. These are the different emails that I have to work on. Okay, right? And let me come here. And then there's also statuses open pending closed. And then there's also tags. So you can categorize these emails. So like this is a billing email or this is an escalation, or this is an invoice email. And these are completely customizable.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Okay. And does the status automatically set? Or is that a manual set?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  The status is manual.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Okay. Got it. Now.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  These things here that we did like the assigning the tags, that is all you can all be done manual, but it can also be automated. So for instance, here, we can do automations based on keywords. So if a keyword in the subject or body line, let's just say you handle all the invoices, right? So if an email comes in and it has the word invoice in the subject or body, we… can have it so that it automatically gets assigned to you that it automatically applies the invoice tag and it automatically applies this SLA, which means that you have to respond to this email with a certain amount of time. So we can, yeah, so we can set up automations for these different email addresses that you have, so that they can automate a lot of the assigning and things like that. Okay… there's also custom fields here. So for anything custom that you're looking to track, these could be text fields, date fields, et cetera. And then here's the communication piece. So you can put notes down here. And you also hit the at mention button. Everyone's name in the account pops up and it's be like, hey, Cole, can you help on this? Okay? So you, and then Cole will get notified that I've mentioned him right here… right? So you and your team can go back and forwards internally on these emails, you know, and correspond with each other as well. Okay. Yeah. And then, yeah, you can easily reply to the emails here in hiver. You can set up email templates for those recurring emails that you have… and they can be shared with everybody. And then we also have AI features too. One of them's an AI co pilot where it can actually draft replies for you.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Oh, nice. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So basically you just choose it'll, ask a full prompt question for accuracy purposes. You choose the prompt and then it will go ahead and draft it up for you. And it's interactive, right? If I wanted to make it shorter, you know, anything like that, you can just communicate with it. Okay? And so how the AI learns, it learns from the emails that you've gotten. And it can also reference documents. So if you have any like standard operating procedure documents, snippets. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So it can also reference those, for accuracy. Okay? And then also if you have documents like that, your team can use this to ask questions. Okay. Nice. Yep. So I'll pause there. Any, any questions so far about the folders or, how you assign to each other or anything like that? No?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Everything's looking pretty straightforward. Awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. That's that's absolutely the main takeaway with hiver. And then here each folder is going to have a team view. This is going to allow you to see all the open emails. So all the emails that still have not been closed or across the whole team. So in our operations folder, we still have 49 emails that need to get closed. And I can see, you know, who's working on them, right? So, I can click on anyone's name, like let's just say Yukta, let's say she's out today. I can easily just click on her name. I see she has four emails that need to get done. I can see any of the emails that we've assigned to her. You can see all the back and forwards. You can see when the email came in, notes, changes, et cetera. You can reply for her. And then once it's done, you just simply move it to the close. You'll notice that now it's closed, it's going to go from 49 to 48. Okay? Nice.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  And then,

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  also, let's just say Cole's out today. You can take anyone's work here and just assign it to somebody else. Oh, cool. But basically, yeah, this just gives you visibility, make sure no emails falls through the cracks, gives you visibility across all the emails, right? The response is everything and also just makes it so that you no longer, you know, the team no longer has to log into that address anymore, right? It's all managed within hiver. Yeah. And then also, you're going to see these red lightning bolts here. So these are the slas, so you can set these up for certain emails or all the emails where it's like, you know, you expect a certain response time on them. Okay. Right? So maybe you get certain emails that are really important, you know, about certain issues. You can have those emails be like, okay, we need to make sure that there's a response within two business hours, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. So that's the folders that's how you make sure nothing falls through the cracks here. And then we also have reporting. So you just select the mailbox that you want to see. You select the timeframe could be custom, could be last 90 days. And you're going to see things like how many new emails did you get in the last month? How many emails did you resolve in the last month in that mailbox? And you can group this by person by tags. You can filter it so you can slice and dice it however you want. You're also going to see the workload across the team. So like, you know, in the last month here, we assigned 34 emails to Rakesh, 24 to Cole, and also see the emails sent out by each team member.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Okay. And then you also.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  See the performance of each team member as well. So just like how long it takes them to respond, how long it takes them to resolve these emails. And we can also include customer satisfaction surveys as well in the bottom of the emails. Oh, okay. And then the tags are super helpful because the tags will allow you to look back and say, okay, in the past month, we got 15 emails about accounting issues, or in the last month, we got 10 emails about making a new order, et cetera… right? And then you can also make custom there's custom reports or anything custom you're looking to build. All this information is exportable to a CSV file. So you can choose what you want to export. And then we also have dashboards. Okay? And are the,

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  dashboards customizable too? Yep?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Nice. Yeah. And then on top of that, if you look at the online reviews for hiver, right? Ease of use is a huge reason companies sign up with us. The other one is that we also, we offer 24 seven support. So this goes to a real person. If you needed help on something, you can chat with them. They're also able to hop on the phone with you as well.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Okay. And… gosh I had a question. It's gone.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, good. And then the last thing I'd say.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, if you did, if you had more than five, if you did around eight people, you would get onboarding as well. So there would be someone here dedicated to helping you set this up. Not that it's difficult or you couldn't do it on yourself. That is just another thing that's provided when you have more than five people.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Okay. Nice. Awesome.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. Any other?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Oh, I remember. Is there any integrations that you guys manage like slack or, I mean, other than just the email platforms? Okay. Asana… okay. Quickbooks that's good.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no. So in our Gmail product, we have a slack integration. We don't have the slack integration for our outlook product as of today. Okay? But yeah, hopefully it's coming in the time in the timeline as you imagine. I mean, we use slack internally as you imagine many of our customers use slack. So hopefully we can get that pretty soon. Yeah.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Okay. Wonderful. We don't have slack yet, but we're looking into it because.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I've used plenty of.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Times. So, yep, exactly.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. But yeah, do you use any of these other like clickup or Hubspot or anything like that? No?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Not yet. Okay. We have quickbooks, but, oh, okay. Yeah, Salesforce is, I know Salesforce and slack are, you know… popular owned by Salesforce? So hopefully something can get done soon with that integration that'd be cool. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, these are all the ones that we have, you know, with more partnerships down the road. But yeah, if you're going to get any of these tools, these can all be connected. Okay?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Great. Yeah, I think that's everything. What about pricing? Is that something you can send over to me or?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, definitely. Yeah. So I'm going to email you over everything here. All of our pricing is on our website. We have different packages, right? We have the pro and we have the elite package here. So… the pros are our most popular package. The pro one comes with those slas which are, you know, the ability to you?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Know.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Have those timers for certain emails, Right? But the main reason, and then it has the custom reports, the csat. So pros are our most popular one. And it also comes with the onboarding assistance for over five users. So, but the main reason you're going to be looking at pro is the usage limits here. So this.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Is where we have?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  To look into here? So pro… allows you to have up to five of those shared email addresses connected in hiver. Okay. I know you mentioned you might have up to six?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Yeah. Okay. So.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  If you have six, that would put you in the elite package, which is unlimited… but if you were to keep it at five to start, then you could do the pro. So that's kind of up to you. Yeah. And I know there's a bit of a hike between our pro pricing and the elite pricing. So, happy to work with you on the elite pricing, You know, if it is a requirement to have six. So just keep that in mind. I know this is a, you know, 65 dollars per person versus 105 is steep. So, yeah, I can work with you on pricing.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Okay. But yeah, that's.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  kind of the main differences is that, the number of mailboxes that, you can have connected to hiver. Okay? And then the second piece here is that we do sell in buckets of five. So it's a per user license, right? So you can either buy five users or you can either buy or you can buy 10. Okay. And like I said, I know now we have two things, right? Because you don't necessarily have 10 and you don't necessarily, you know.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Have five?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Have five. So like I said, yeah, we, whatever you decide, you know, I can work with you on pricing, okay? Yep.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Okay. Well, this is all really good. I'll have to think about it and see what budget we can come up with. And then maybe follow up with me in a little bit, maybe at the mid January. Does that sound? Okay. Yeah, it sounds?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Great. We'll be able to just put something on the calendar here. Tentatively. Okay. And if we, yeah, if we need to move it, that's fine. Let's see mid January. What's today? Tuesday? What about like Tuesday, the thirteenth at the same time as today? So I have it at 10 am PST.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Yeah. Let's do it that's totally fine. Okay, great.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Again, I'm going to email everything to you today so that you have it. Okay. And yeah, like I said, any questions come up in the meantime? Let me know. If not, then we'll talk on the thirteenth. Let me just write this down thirteenth. Perfect. Zoey. Was there anything else that you needed? No?

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  That's it. I appreciate your time.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Awesome. Well, have a great New Year's and we'll talk in January, you as well. Thanks. Bye.

Zoey Shipman (zshipman@miraclemethod.com):
  Bye.
