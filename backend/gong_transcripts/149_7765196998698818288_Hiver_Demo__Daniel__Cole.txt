Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on Dan?

Danielwsheppard:
  Oh, not much man. How are you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Danielwsheppard:
  I'm all right. Thanks for having me. I'm out in the field today, so it's an interesting place to be sometimes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. But I appreciate, you know, hopping on here, Dan. So just to set a quick agenda, I would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role. What got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps.

Danielwsheppard:
  Sounds good. Yeah, I'll introduce myself first then. So I'm Dan, I am the owner of prickly pear wildlife removal and home services.

Danielwsheppard:
  We are a wildlife removal company in Austin, Texas. What that means is that our day to day is you have a noise that goes bump in the night, you call us out. We inspect, we figure out, hey, you got a raccoon living in your attic, we humanely convince it to leave on its own and then once it's out, we harden the house so it can't get back in and then we fix whatever damage it left behind.

Danielwsheppard:
  And then because I like recurring revenue and I need an mrr business, we sell some pest control on top of that, so that we stay busy coming around and continuing to give you service after you loved what we did the first time.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So we'd love to just understand further Dan, what kind of prompted you to reach out to hiver? I did see you started a free trial, you're managing some shared mailboxes is that the primary purpose you're looking for? Hiver?

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah. I mean, my primary need and why hiver is I need a shared mailbox for sales. And for info, we're currently using a Google group to do it and it's just super not effective. We can't see the communication and what's going on. And next year, I'm going to expand probably going to add another two salespeople and another two or three office people. So at that point with six people managing customers, I need a way to make sure that none of these things are dropping through the crack and that we're not just duplicating a bunch of effort to these customers.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. That makes total sense. And how many people are working through the emails today, Dan? Like how many people? Three right now? Three?

Danielwsheppard:
  Total three right now, and I expect to add, like I said, probably another four over the course of next year.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Gotcha. So I'm happy to run you through a product demonstration here. Dan just kind of give you the features and functions of hiver, how we help your business. But yeah, feel free to stop and ask any questions as we're going through it.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah. And secondarily for you, just a little bit of background for you about me. I'm a 25 year big tech product leader. So I've been a PM, a product marketing manager. I've been a director of product. I've kind of done a bunch of roles, built a bunch of things. I left Google two and a half months ago to jump in and do this full time for the next six months and try and grow this thing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, awesome. Very cool.

Danielwsheppard:
  So I'm pretty well versed in software and Gmail and most things. So, my secondary part here is I use housecall pro to do my field service management today. It's got some, they call it some customer management, some CRM type stuff. It does not do anything like any traditional CRM and it doesn't have customer as the center of the stage. It has a job as the center of the stage. So that being said integration opportunities between hiver and housecall pro super interesting for me because eventually, if I'm selling, if I'm turning a lead into a customer, they're showing up in housecall pro. And if I'm doing work, for a customer, that work is all tracked in housecall pro. So ways to tie them together in the long term would be super interesting. But that's not why that's not going to drive my buying behavior today.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just capabilities like the possibility of the future and that's totally a capability. So with our pro plan, you do have access to our open API to create custom integration. So totally something that for a future state you can take a look at.

Danielwsheppard:
  All right. Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But taking a look at my screen here, Dan, you know, what's nice about hiver, you know, we are that certified Google partner. We live within the workspace. So just logging in with your normal Gmail, and then on the left hand side, you'll have those shared inboxes that you're managing as an organization. So I'll click into the support share mailbox, and when I do it opens up some sub views beneath it that helps manage, you know, the queues of that. So whether it's the unassigned view, new emails that have hit the mailbox, that need to be delegated, the mind view everything that's been assigned to me. And then from the team view. So understanding whatever on the team is working on in real time within those mailboxes, what's outstanding and what needs to be completed across that team. But going into the unassigned view, right? The goal is to have unassigned zero and we can route work in a couple of different ways. The first way is we can manually do it by clicking on someone's name. In this case, I'll assign it to myself. The next way we can assign work is a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the conversations as they come in, ensuring fair workload distribution is happening amongst the team. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So as the team grows, maybe people have certain specialties, skill sets. So when a client reaches out, let's make sure that email is always being sent to that person who has that specific specialty.

Danielwsheppard:
  And when you do skill based routing, is it reading the sentiment or the message and doing it based on keyword or what skills is it using to base this routing around?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it can be based off of sentiment. We do have AI sentiment analysis, so we can route on that. We can also route on the keywords or key phrases in the subject line or the body of text?

Danielwsheppard:
  Okay. Cool. Yeah. My thought process right now is at some point we're going to have a, this is already a customer and this is a lead. So I might want to send customers to customer support and leads to sales even though they both came into the info box.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Okay. No, that makes total sense. Yeah. And then we have that like status tracking capability. So, you know, whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks. We're working through these two resolution, you know, adding those tags for organizational purposes. We can also report on those tags in the backend to say, see, hey, what are the hot requests we're getting across that mailbox? Like why are people reaching out over the last day week month? Whatever you want to see? And then the custom fields. So we actually have like a CRM type flavor where we can track custom fields whether they're dropdown fields, date range fields, text box fields or value fields. So another way to view data in the platform, take action on it, report on it and search on the information as well.

Danielwsheppard:
  All right. So if I, again, that future look and the engineering is going to come out. So we use tags inside of housecall pro. Can I map these tags to these custom fields? Like is that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So the tags from housecall pro, map them to the custom fields, yeah.

Danielwsheppard:
  So, example being I came out to do a job at your house, I don't know you had cockroaches. So I sprayed for cockroaches. There's a tag that says cockroach… when you call back in and I look at this, is there a way for me to like pull those tags out of that job and stick them over here so that we have a way to see kind of most of the work? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For sure. So as you can see, we have like integrates with like Salesforce pulling in information or fields totally a capability. We just have to scope it out and do it.

Danielwsheppard:
  Perfect. Yeah, that makes sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then going to the collaboration aspect, you can collaborate internally, I'll send this note to matt being like, hey, can you help here? And we'll see that notification up top. He'll click on it. It'll take him to this thread where we can kind of keep having that back and forth maybe he'll use like our AI summarizer to get up to speed on the context really quickly. But let's say we need more information, right? We do have an AI co pilot that can draft replies so I can click into this co pilot right here and actually let me go to the fresh one. So just use this.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. So I can go to the co pilot right here draft a reply based on the context. It's then going to feed me some prompts of how I'd want to respond to it. So, I'm going to pick the first one acknowledge update and confirm receivable records.

Danielwsheppard:
  This is neat. By the way. Are you all using gemini in the background for that?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Openai? Okay.

Danielwsheppard:
  I was.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  A gemini engineer. Oh, you were a gemini engineer? Okay. Got it. Well.

Danielwsheppard:
  PM for gemini, but I was on the engineering team for gemini for over a year before I left.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Yeah.

Danielwsheppard:
  It's why I started building a wildlife company. You're like.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I don't know if these roles are going to be around that much longer.

Danielwsheppard:
  When I started looking around, I was like I need to build something AI can't eat. So now I have a wildlife company.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, hey, now, you're captaining your own ship, you're working on your own clock?

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah, it's something else. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And how did you get into that? Like you just like it was just something that you've always had an interest in or just kind of like, you know, fell into your lap.

Danielwsheppard:
  I mean, I'm a builder, right? Like like I've built my entire career around engineering. Yeah. So because of that diy home repair stuff has always been a thing. So, when I started, when I realized what I was building around AI, and then what that would mean for product management, I was like, so I need to diversify income streams here. I need to build something, that AI isn't going to take away from me to go along with my AI career because I can make a… difference, but I need some residual, some annuity kind of income coming from some other source.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Totally. Yeah.

Danielwsheppard:
  So, I started looking at, well, what would that be? And I landed on home services and I started looking at, well, what home service would I want to do? And I eventually came to the conclusion no one wildlife is a huge problem and no one really seems to understand how big of a problem it is. So no one's paying attention to, how they could do this. So, there's no specialized licensing required. You got to get a pest control license, but that's about it. And I was like, okay, yeah, like this seems like a thing to go build there's. A huge growing market here. I looked at a bunch of franchises. I literally, I did, I took the same approach that you take when you build it, when you build software from nothing.

Danielwsheppard:
  I found people who are having that problem and I went out and rode with them. So I found guys, I flew out to Canada. I spent two days riding around with guys doing wildlife removal in Canada, and then I, and this kind of work in Canada. I went down to Corpus Christi in Texas, spent a day with a Guy out there doing trapping, trying to figure out what he was doing there and came back here and built my own thing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Wow. That's awesome.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah. So the whole branding, all of it, it's mine. I created it from nothing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it sounds like the barrier to entry, just low, right? You don't need to get like you said, it's not a ton of regulations, red tape to get involved. You just have to get that one license. And then you just need to find people who know you can go on site and just find the people who are looking for, to solve that problem. Wow.

Danielwsheppard:
  And, you know, most people in this industry came up doing services in this industry. So they don't understand how to make their phone ring. They don't understand how to scale a business. Well, I came into this as I can build a business and if I can find a market, I can build something to solve for that market. So I found a market, and then I built this thing. And then it's just about telling the market we exist, and that's how we grow, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, do you have a lot of SEO like paid advertising and stuff like that? Yeah.

Danielwsheppard:
  So I came into this thing, you know, it's a huge milestone for a Guy to get out of the truck and get a second technician in this industry? Yeah, I came into this industry with a team of four people because I still had a day job, so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Danielwsheppard:
  I like that. They're like what you started with four, you started with four employees. You didn't grow from like chucking a truck. And eventually after years of grinding, you get bigger, I said, hell, no, I put capital into this thing and I grew it from day one.

Danielwsheppard:
  So, yeah, yeah. So now, fast forward to today. Like we're going to be, you know, we're almost like we're about a year, 18 months old, 19 months old. At this point, we're still measured in months and we're going to do close probably 2,000,000 next year. Top line. Wow. I mean, I.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  got to get on shark tank man.

Danielwsheppard:
  I mean, next step is got to open up new markets, right? Like, yeah, I got to. So I'm here for the next. I said I was going to dedicate six months to it. So I'm here until summer next year. And then I'll figure out if I want to go back into AI or if this thing's paying my bills and I need to just focus on scaling it even more.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Wow. That's awesome. I mean, that's not a bad problem to have, you know, options. You got options at the end of the day?

Danielwsheppard:
  It's crazy. So anyway, back to this. So I'm looking at this first thing that jumped out to me because I kind of played around with it for the last week is when I archive something, it still stays in the, it still stays in hiver underneath that mailbox, which I think is fine.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because we don't recommend to archive, like is closing an email is like archiving for us, right? That's like our equivalent. So that's just the difference you'll do with hiver.

Danielwsheppard:
  All right, cool. And then,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  once you close, it goes to the views, right? You can create these custom views for different types of requests, different cues and stuff like that.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah. And then my team's already trained to use Google chat. Is there a way when you tag someone in a like how to, is there another way to get the notice besides the little bell at the top? Like when you've tagged someone in it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, right now, that is the main way to get a notification like you'll see like a number up here? It also can make a noise too, like it can make like a prompting noise to be like, hey, you're being notified and something?

Danielwsheppard:
  None of us have like unless you're wearing your headphones, you're not hearing anything? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. But so we could also, and we recommend using the notes section over the Google chat for like ticketing purposes because it lives on it historically, right? It just kind of doesn't get lost in like the messaging threads like it'll stay on that conversation for history.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah. I think that's fine. I was just more thinking about, hey, can I have a chat bot that says, hey, Dan, you've been tagged in this thread? Click here to go over and do it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So pretty much, yeah, that's just right here like you'll get the notification up top and you can click on these too. So I can like, you know, it was at mentioned, let's say in this one, I can just click on it and it pulls you right to the thread.

Danielwsheppard:
  Okay. Yeah. I mean, like I said, it's just new for them. They've been trained on using chat. So if anywhere I can, any way I can bring it back to the chat is always good because then I can have a bot tag them.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you're 100 percent and then in terms of analytics, David, you offer some solid ones. So, you know, some out of the box reports being conversational users, tags, contacts, SLA, csat, and sentiment. So for conversations, you know, we can see active new resolve conversations, understand the volume over the time period, what our average first response time was, our average resolution time, some key performance metrics.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, breaking it down by users like, you know, emails assigned per user sent out. And then what's the people's individual performance metrics from an average first response or average resolution time.

Danielwsheppard:
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then I think this is probably one of the best ones. Just the tag report, you know, what are the queries we're getting within these mailboxes? What are the hot topics we're seeing amongst the team?

Danielwsheppard:
  Okay. Yeah. Mine would look weird. Man. It's not going to say things like billing AI, extract it's, going to say things like, cockroaches? Raccoon?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Raccoon in the attic.

Danielwsheppard:
  Feces yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  The feces request, but that's pretty much the main things then the class, the last thing is just the admin panel right where we'll set it up, add the users create automations, integrations and stuff like that.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah, cool.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So just based off of your experience, I know the trial is expiring on the eighth. Does this seem like it's something like you do want to move forward with to help manage those inboxes?

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah. I think I need to pull my, I need to spend some time this weekend and get the rules in place so that, you know, the tagging like the assignments are automatically happening. I also need to pull in my sales Guy and give him a chance to play with it. Okay? I'll be really honest with you. My sales Guy sucks at keeping up with the tools. Yeah, like he'll go out and he'll do an inspection, which you should largely read that as he'll go create, do the data discovery to prepare an estimate, right?

Danielwsheppard:
  And then he'll write no notes, right? So you're like what the hell did you do? You spent two hours with the client? You wrote an estimate. But what did you see? Why did you write this in the estimate versus that? Yeah. And then there's you know, he'll chase the estimate and there'll be no notes. And then all of a sudden it'll be approved, right? So, if you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  offer a mobile app too for people on the go that's something that we do have. Yeah.

Danielwsheppard:
  I downloaded it and I kind of took a look at it as well. So I think that's going to be helpful. Like I said, I'm trying to figure out, will he actually use this, right? Right? And I've spent over a year coaching him to do more and he's gotten better but he's still not good. By any means, right? It's just really hard because, you know, he blows out his number every month and his close rate is high and you're like, well, how much do I sweat him over documentation when he's beating goal every month?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you're right? It's like, you know, why shake the house if nothing's wrong?

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah. Like on one side, I'm like dude, I need this because if something ever happened to you like you can't take a day off, I can't keep up with your customers.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right, right.

Danielwsheppard:
  So, yeah, so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  What I can do is I can extend this until the trials of the thirteenth next week to just give you some more time.

Danielwsheppard:
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, when would be a good time to touch base with you for like 15 minutes next week to see how the trial is going and talk about potential next steps.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah, maybe late next week. And normally, I'm not in the field, but I had a Guy have a baby and another Guy's out sick. So like, this is an anomaly of a week, you know, dude can't have a baby every month… would?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Wednesday work for you, same time?

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah, we could do Wednesday same time. It's it's open for me. Let's do it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. I'll just send over a trial sync and then I'll follow up some more information Dan, like set up guides and stuff like that and some case studies that you can review. And then we'll touch base next week.

Danielwsheppard:
  Sounds like a plan man.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right, perfect. It was, you know, great to meet you, Dan, and I will, I'll talk to you soon.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah, yeah. It was nice meeting you and, you know, if you decide you want to come sell some wildlife, I'll get you out here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Maybe we'll expand out the New York market.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah, we'll see you got winter coming there, man. Yeah. Are you in New York City or are you out upstate?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Brooklyn, New York?

Danielwsheppard:
  All right. Yeah. So you're right in the thick of it?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm right? I mean, I'm in rat central, you know, right? Right where pest control needs to be.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah. The rats man, the rats out there, it's something else just to give you a quick aside because I learned cool things whenever I started doing this. Yeah, the rats of New York City during the, during covid and the pandemic, they saw rats explode there and to the billions. And the messed up thing about rodents is they can breed every 30 days and they can get pregnant 24 hours after having a litter.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, my goodness. That is insane.

Danielwsheppard:
  And it takes about 25 days for a baby rat to get big enough, to have to get pregnant and have its own baby rats. So we're… screwed. We're screwed, never nerd out in a bath. That kind of exponential growth is just ridiculous.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, you're saying there's like 15,000,000,000 rats in the city most likely.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah. I mean, you know, everyone hates to use like rodenticide now, rat poison and rodents you have like literally the population is exploding and you have to do something, you can't do nothing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Now.

Danielwsheppard:
  And if you can, you know, like rat birth control is a real thing. Now… it's weird man. When you start digging into this and you're like wow these numbers like rodents alone are just driving the business. So, yeah, covid caused a huge resurgence in rodents because all these commercial businesses were using rodenticide and no residential sites were using rodenticide. Yeah. So there, once the rodents realized the food left the left corporate America and it was now in the neighborhoods, the rodents went to the neighborhoods and they just grew radically.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. That's another side effect from covid that we're still dealing with. Yeah.

Danielwsheppard:
  Oh, yeah. All right. Well, anyway, I will let you go. You have a good one and I'll take a look at this weekend and see if I can't get it all set up.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  OK, perfect. Thanks. Great to meet you.

Danielwsheppard:
  Yeah. Nice meeting. You. Have a good one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  OK, bye.

Danielwsheppard:
  Bye.
