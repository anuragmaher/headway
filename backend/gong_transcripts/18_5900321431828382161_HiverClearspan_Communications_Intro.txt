================================================================================

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  hey, Kurt. How are you?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Good. How are you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Good, good. Appreciate you joining.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Yeah, I'm sure sort of quiet right now with leading up to the new year.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, definitely. We still have decent amount of meetings but definitely not as busy as it usually is.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Yeah, yeah. I normally wouldn't be able to take a meeting because just time. So, the good thing even though when you run operations, nothing ever stops, but it's a little slower so.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. Well, perfect. Glad it worked out. So, my name is matt senior account executive here at hiver agenda for the call today. Wanted to spend the first couple minutes here, just getting an understanding of maybe any motivations for taking this meeting. Anything that was top of mind for you?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Well, what I would like you to do is tell me a little bit about hiver first, right? Just, you know, just let's go over there, and then we'll flip the script on that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. We could do that. So, let me go ahead and share my screen here. I'm going to walk through some slides.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. So I'm not too familiar. Not sure if you're too familiar with hiver, but just to put it simply not.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  At all, other than the blurb, and it sounded like, okay, I could use that, but go ahead.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  For hiver is essentially a help desk platform, Right? So we help operations teams, customer support teams, accounting teams, any teams that really have shared email addresses that they need to manage, right? So think like support at info, at operations, at billing at. So one of the main functions that hiver does is it helps teams manage… those emails more efficiently.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Okay, right.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And basically… a lot of customers these days and age, they want to feel heard, they want to feel understood. But most teams are working with tools that make it hard to deliver a good experience. And this is where hiver steps in. This is where AI steps in and just helps companies meet the customers where they're at with faster and smarter answers, right? So right now, a lot of teams are doing endless grunt work. They're manually forwarding emails to each other. There's no single source of truth. You get limited insight into the communications across these different channels. And there's workflow constraints, right? So the challenge is clear that teams are working hard but the tools are holding them back. And with these rule based workflows to handle simple tasks, they kind of struggle with different workflows. And then also the manual effort is made worse by tools that the teams use. So legacy help desks are used, not built for this AI era. They're clunky. They're hard to navigate. They rely on rigid workflows that demand constant upkeep. And hiver is easy to use, easy to set up, has the AI capabilities to help with these workflows. And then are you guys using any type of help desk platform right now or using Zendesk front, any of these people?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  So we use, and when you say help desk, I'm going to use this term a little bit loosely, but we use remedy as a trouble ticketing system. Okay? Are you familiar with remedy?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Not really. Is that for like it ticketing?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Yeah, it's trouble ticketing. So just to go back into a little bit about, you know, when you asked about us and why? So I run a network operations control center, right? We do tier two and tier three support for our customer base.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  And our customer base is federal, state and local government at T is our biggest customer… approximately 500,000 end users. But out of that 500,000 end users, there are enterprises or government organizations that do have an it support function built into them. So the it support people are the ones that actually open up trouble tickets with us. They do call in to us as well. Our 800 number, right? We don't currently use like support at clearspancloud. Com. Part of the reason is because we had no mechanism to filter it out. And as you know, in sales, everybody will use any angle to penetrate the company. So like support at clearspancloud. Com just generally gets spam, it gets sales people. It gets, you know, 90 percent of the traffic that when we tried doing it was stuff we didn't want, right? So we don't currently even use that type of, we don't do email to open up a ticket even because it's been unmanageable for us. So that's part of where I'm coming from is, excuse me, how can I help my, how can I be more accessible to my customers to do what they need to give them the service they need? You know, and, you know, at the end of the day, like we use remedy helix and that is good for the trouble ticketing back end, but it doesn't it's not that great for the end user experience.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So they can go on this remedy?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  They log into a portal and then open a ticket that way instead.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Of tickets. Okay. Got it. And are you using Microsoft suite? Yeah. Okay. Got it. Okay. Awesome. And okay. Yeah. So then, yeah, what I'll do is I'll just show you kind of how hiver looks and I guess I can just get your feedback there. And then just a couple more slides here about hiver. Yeah. So a little background about us. We've been around since 2017. We've raised over 30,000,000 dollars in funding. We're used by over 10,000 teams globally with some of our largest customers including companies like flexport, vacasa, and capital one. And then really it's and then across all sectors. So logistics, technology, healthcare, manufacturing, and, you know, companies like samsara as well.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Can you, can you go back to that slide real quick? Yeah.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  I gotta be honest. I'm just looking for any company I recognized.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Oh, recognize harvard boise state.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Okay. All right. Thank you. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. I'm familiar with samsara, they're quite a large tech company.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Just probably just my ignorance. Yeah. And then.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  One of our largest customers we just, you know, really can't advertise it too much. Is capital one? Okay?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Yeah, we know them yep. Okay. Yeah, no, I get it. Just because they're a customer doesn't mean they allow you to put their logo on that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, of course. And, you know, some of the things that you can expect with rolling out something like hiver and flexport's a very large logistics company is just, you know, faster resolution times, hours being saved, right? And then, you know, how quick it is, to kind of onboard and use.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Yeah. So real quick out of these companies are, is it a mixed? Excuse me, are, the people needing service employees and internal customers or do they have or do they use this to support their external customer base as well?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's really a mix? Okay?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  All right. Yeah, because I'm only concerned about external customer base. I have no interest into internals too easy for me to worry about. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Well, most of them are, is external use case.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Okay. All.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. Yep. Awesome. So, let me go ahead and show you how it works here. That'll make it easier… for you. Give me a second here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, as of today, hiver, really supports two main channels and that's email channels and then chat channels. So, think like a chat on your website.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Those are the two main channels that hiver supports. So essentially, what you're going to see on the left, it's a web based platform. You're going to, you're, going to log in using your Microsoft credentials. Once you log in, you're going to see these folders. On the left hand side, you could have one folder, you could have multiple folders, right? And then each folder is going to be tied to a shared email address. So think like support at things like that, right? Makes sense. And then once the emails come in to the right folder, they're going to have you're going to have this panel on the right hand side. And with this panel, you can assign it to people on your team. So assign this to matt. Matt gets notified that he's responsible for this email, their statuses for them now open pending close. So, you know, if this email has been handled or not. And then there's tags to categorize them. So like what types of email is this? And we also have automations where this can be done automatically. So essentially, you know, how most of our customers have it set up is that if somebody emails in to the support email, hiver will automatically assign it to the right person who's responsible for handling that ticket and can automatically categorize it. And then also can automatically apply things like slas. So think like, you know, this is a type of email that needs to be responded within X amount of hours or we want to be notified that it's late. Okay? So essentially, hiver can triage and automate that whole process. Okay, right? And then there's also a note section down here where you can hit the add mention button. Everyone's name in the account pops up. So, you can work internally and go back and forwards with your team on answering these emails.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You can also reply to the emails here directly in hiver. You can set up email templates for those reoccurring emails for the team to use, which can save time. And then we also have an AI copilot. So, what the AI copilot does is it can actually draft email replies for you and it's going to ask like a four prompt question for accuracy purposes. And then based on what you choose, it will go ahead and prompt it up. It can also reference documents, a knowledge base and snippets as well. So it can provide contextual answers. So the AI learns from emails that you're getting, it, can reference documents that you upload snippets that you upload and a knowledge base. Okay? And it's you know, fully conversational, I can say, you know, make it shorter or reference this etc, and it will do all that. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  The other benefit is this team view here. This is going to allow you to see all the open emails across the team. So, if I'm running the support team here, you know, the tier one or tier two support team email, I can easily see, okay, we have 50 open emails right now, and I can see who's working on those emails and I can see which ones are late, Right? So I can click on any of my team members here. I can click on call. I can click on any of his emails even if he's out. And I can see the whole history when the email came in different conversations that had different threads and I could even work on it and close it out for him. Okay?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Additionally, if calls out today, I can even take all the stuff that we've assigned to him and just mass assigned to somebody else?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It also has different integrations with different CRM systems and project management tools. Are you using Salesforce or Hubspot? We?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Use Salesforce, but we don't use Salesforce from a support side, we use it from a sales side, but you said Salesforce Hubspot?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  I'm just trying to think of an application for us because again, remedy is what we're using from the support side. And you guys have no integration with remedy. It's spelled.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  REMED y, yeah, yeah.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Or you might see it as helix HELIX. Okay.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I see it. Yeah, remedy helix it solutions, client management discovery. We do not have any native integrations with it, but if it was something that had to get done, we do have an API that we could potentially scope it out if needed. But basically how the Salesforce one works. And again, if it doesn't apply that's fine. Is when somebody emails in to one of these support channels, if they're already a lead in the Salesforce, it will show all that information or if there's an opportunity, it will show account, it will show contact. It will show, yeah.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Yeah, and see for us because we do not, we don't take in like a customer inquiry before, you know, another, by the time I touch them, there are, I shouldn't say that they're a customer and my team actually got an order and I'm doing the installation and it's post sales support. There's. No like customer, a potential customer who's a lead coming in that never happens with us by design. We intentionally don't want that got.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It, so if they're already a customer, would they show up like as a contact or? Yeah, yeah.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  We have, and when they call in, they well, first of all, if they call in or if they email, I mean, I shouldn't say email, if they go into the portal, they have to be a contact already. We have to create them, right? So, Matter of fact, what happens if someone reaches out who's not in our list? That's a problem because they're probably by design, not supposed to call into us, you know, because that's where, we're not a consumer based product line, you know, we sell to again an enterprise fed sled.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  And so we intentionally do not want just a user, an end user calling us because they're not if they're calling us, that means someone that we're having to do extra labor that their it team is supposed to provide. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Got it. But it's also part of our value proposition that we're pretty cost effective, but it means part of that is you guys take on the responsibility of tier… one support, right? The user, the customer takes on tier one support. Okay. Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So that's how the email channels work there. What are your thoughts on that? I know you mentioned that you used the email in the past. Probably not something you'd be open to doing again. Is that what it kind of is?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Yeah. I don't see. I don't see that by itself providing a lot of value to us just by itself. Now, again, I mentioned remedy if there's a, you know, a solution that displaces remedy helix and it has a front end that does all that, then I would say, well, okay, now I can bolt it on, right? But you guys, you know, clearly, you're not doing work with them today. You know, you're not integrated. I am, I hate Salesforce with a passion. So I'm not going to be supportive of doing anything that would integrate it with Salesforce. But don't get me wrong. Salesforce is 100 pound gorilla. And I'm not naive everywhere I've ever been though. I hate it because it becomes a… you become a slave to them versus, you know, like you got to do everything in their world and pay their ransom and I stay away from it. Yeah, yeah, Tony stark.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  We use, yeah, I've used Salesforce at most of the companies I've been in. I've been at smaller companies and bigger ones use Hubspot right now, but I'm sure it's a similar story with Hubspot as well. Yeah.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Well, Hubspot ServiceNow, stuff like that to me. I like better, you know, just, I just feel like you're… not held, you know, at gunpoint with other guys, but yeah, I don't think this is really, I see what it does but it just doesn't play into our business. I was hoping there was going to be some integration with remedy like boom, you know, where I could just bolt it on the front end with no problem. But the… API component of it really sort of that's not going to do me any good. I would sort of prefer to survive the way I am right now. Yeah, that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. And then the last second piece here just real quick is the chat function where essentially you can just slap a chat on whether it's a, you can create a knowledge base with hiver or if you have a knowledge base online that people use, right? Yeah. And people can have conversations here. And then those conversations would come into hiver, it'll tell you where they're from the name, the email, you can assign it to different people. And then we also have AI agents as well. So the AI can actually handle these chats. And if it's not resolved, it can get handed off to a real person, right?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Yeah. And I absolutely, in one of my previous jobs… I ran an internet company and we managed the end users. I could absolutely see where that would come in handy. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Well, hey, I really appreciate your time today. I'll email all the information to you if anything changes down the road, let me know. And yeah, I think you also let me just make sure here. Yeah. And then also make sure keep an eye out for the gift voucher that we promised too. So that'll come through via email as well. Yeah, I.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  totally forgot about that part, but yeah, I'll keep an eye out. I see what you guys are doing and it makes some sense and if our businesses, we are acquiring companies. So what I'm doing, I always tell every salesperson I deal with. I go look if I'm not your fit today. Call me back in three to six months because you might be my fit tomorrow, right? So keep me on your tickler to just reach out every now and then, I prefer that I'm not one of those people that hides behind a salesperson calling me. I like, you know, let's talk and see where we are. But cool. Well, I appreciate it very much. And, you know, walking through by the way, I am curious on the back end where's the, is the, on the AI side of it, is that just a separate like you have a management interface that the administrator goes in and loads the data in that way? Yeah. And then the second part is based on interactions that are occurring between the team. Does hiver learn like?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Yeah. Hiver does learn and then, yeah, just like you said, on the back end, there's an admin panel that's only accessible for the administrative roles that you set in here. And then, yeah, you'll see there's a section for the AI and this is where you can upload the various knowledge sources, documents, snippets notion, articles, knowledge base. Okay?

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  Cool. Yeah. All right. So, there is some, you know, which makes sense. You have to there's administrative function, getting the critical information in there. Okay. Cool. Yep. Well, cool. I appreciate it. Yeah, thanks.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Again, Kurt, we'll be in touch. I'll circle back with you. I'll email everything to you today too, just so that you have it and I hope you have a great new year. Thank.

Kurt Whitcher (kurt.whitcher@clearspancloud.com):
  You so much. I appreciate it. You take care. Bye, bye bye.
