Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  oh, my gosh. Too much going on. Just a moment. I believe Holly is here.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  I'm here. Hi.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Good afternoon, Holly. How are you?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Good. How are you?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Doing well, doing well. Thank you. There's too many note takers here in this meeting. I'm just, I think there are more.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Let's keep them on at the time. That's fine.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Sure. Yeah, there seems to be more note takers and people in this meeting. But anyway, we're all here. Okay? I'm just appraising all of it. Awesome. Hi, Holly. It's been a while since we spoke. How have you been?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  I've been good. Happy new year. Thank.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  You. Happy new year to you too. How was your new year?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  It was good. How was your new year?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Uneventful. It was quiet, so.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  That was mine. Yeah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  It was exactly how I wanted. So, after a fairly chaotic year, why don't you just sit and chill with, you know, family friends and yeah, just very close ones. And that's exactly how it was. What did you do that?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Is literally what we did? We went to my grandmother's house and we just all relaxed and had a great time. So, we were in bed by probably 1,245. So, I was very happy.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Same exactly same. So, yeah, I mean, sometimes you just want that, right? I mean, yeah, sometimes you want to party or whatever. But for me, it was the quiet, nice kind. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm glad that you had a lovely beginning to 20 26 as well. Well. We, I think now have everybody who was meant to be part of this call. We have Raghav, of course, your account manager, and we have Anurag, who is part of our, a, I team. In fact, he is heading the a I features and functionalities here at hiver and we just wanted to talk to you and discuss how things have been so far, what's next and so on. But before proceeding any further, I'll take a step back and Raghav and Anurag, if you guys want to say, hello, sorry.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, good. Holly. Hi, it's been a, it's great meeting you. I think it's been a while since we spoke. Oh,

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  yeah, I feel like it's been like a month or so.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  How's it been? How was holidays? How's new year shaping up for you?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  It's been good. How was yours? How was your guys holidays?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, sweet. Settled in. It looks like it definitely does not feel like 20 26. Just started. I'll tell you that much, you know, the last two or three weeks have been pretty hectic for us in a good way. A lot of functionality, loads of features and obviously a lot more conversations with our customers. So we're pretty excited because a I is one of the biggest strategic priorities for hiver as a business this year. And I'm excited that we are getting to chat about it with you alongside quite a few of our top customers. So excited to meet you going forward. I'm going to be more of a supporting resource to udita when it comes to functionality, workflows, optimizations. And you'd see me taking the lead in the partnership when it comes to commercials expansion, growth opportunities for hiver and the secure choice lending partnership. I've been with the business for about eight years here at hiver. So excited to continue optimizing and improving our footprint with your business.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yeah, fantastic. OK. So you guys have to forgive me because I kind of remember the last time that we, what we spoke about if we go over the same topic again, I am sorry, but yeah, I'm excited to give a, I, a try. I know we tried some features out for you guys. I'm excited to talk about it and see what else you guys have.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely, absolutely. And trust me Holly, I think Raghav will also agree with me when I say this that when we pause in December and then we restart again in January, there are things we tend to unlearn and relearn so we can go over the same things a couple of times. No problem at all. Great. So regarding a, I, right? So, I think the first thing that I'm going to ask is we did have a chance to look at some of the things that you are currently using, but in this case, I think, you know, the floor would be yours. How has it been? What have you used? What did you find useful? What did you not find useful? Can you give us a brief understanding, please? Yes.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  OK. So we definitely tried out the I'm trying to remember what it was called. But the faces, so like the Smiley faces and the sad faces, I feel it because people are not so nice to us. It was a little discouraging for the team. So, we would have like so many emails and they were all neutral and like several sad faces. And then we'd get one green one. So the team was just like kind of feeling a little defeated. So I turned that off and they felt like it was a little overwhelming because they didn't know how to prioritize any of them because they were all kind of neutral or mad. So we didn't really care for that one too much. I think it's still on in another inbox of ours that I don't manage. So I'll have to ask them how they feel about it. Let's see what else did we talk about? I feel like that's the only thing I remember.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  What we can do, Holly, is, if you're comfortable sharing your screen, we can open the admin panel. There are a couple of new things that we want to, point out to you. But before that go over the things that, you know, the features and functionalities that have been enabled for you. So, could you share your screen for us?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yes, of course, once I remember, I think it's just this.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  At the very bottom, you see a green arrow. Yeah, fantastic.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Perfect.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Now, on the top, right next to the bell, is the hiver settings on the top, right, next to the bell, top, right? Yes, fantastic admin panel. The first option. Fantastic. Now, on the left hand side, do you see the fourth from the top is hiver, AI, yes. Could you click on that? Please, right? So here, you have a little bit more than what you had the last time that we spoke, which is AI tagging, QA, sentiment analysis, and thank you detector. And of course, the co pilot now sentiment analysis is the one that is a Smiley faces. So we can always go ahead and turn this off from the configure option right here. So it will turn off for all of your mailboxes. You don't have to go individually and turn them off however.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Just.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  curious to know, you know, because one of the feedback that we receive from our clients who have used AI sentiment analysis is that when they see a negative sentiment, they prioritize that particular email conversation as opposed to when they see a neutral or a happy face. Is that not something that you're able to do right now because we can set up automations for that as well?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  I think maybe if we can just do the one face like the sad face, maybe that would be helpful. But it like made it felt like our inbox was a little more cluttered because usually we have any time from 40 to 100 emails in our inbox. And we're all just kind of moving at a fast pace. But like some of the team members were saying, it felt overwhelming with the faces because like even though it was like a neutral face, it was still kind of like a bleh face, you know? So the team told me that they were just feeling slightly overwhelmed with the faces on the emails.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Okay. Well, now we cannot keep only one turned on because if you click on configure here, then there's a three pointer on the right hand side, there's the configure option just next to AI sentiment analysis. The third option configure. Yeah. So you notice how there's a three point scale and a five point scale. So we cannot really have just the one, it has to be either positive negative neutral or very positive neutral, positive. Very negative. You get what I'm saying? So that is something, you know, that cannot change. Really, we can have a three pointer or a five pointer. But if this is something that you do not want to utilize right now, what we can do is we can focus on the other AI features and functionalities and get an understanding of how those have worked out for you. Is that okay?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yeah, that's perfect.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So in that case, the other thing that you have been using, could you click on AI co pilot, please the tab next to AI agent? We noticed that you're using ask AI? I in fact noticed that mark and Trent have been using it quite a bit and AI summarizer, but AI compose is turned off for you. So what's your experience been with these? And, you know, any feedback that you want to share?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  I personally have not used the AI compose. I would need to chat with mark and Trent. Let me write that down so I can talk to them after I get off this call to see if they're enjoying it. Yeah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I meant to ask AI AI compose is any way disabled for you? So we can turn it on for you. You can go ahead and turn it on. Okay. Yeah.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  I'll give it a try… see how that works. And.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  We can show you a quick demonstration of how that works as well, but would love to hear how, you know, the summarizer and ask AI has been working for you guys?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. I honestly have not worked the ask AI, so I have to do some homework for our next call and use the ask AI. I haven't asked Trent or mark how they enjoy it, but I know they are AI fanatics. So I will have to ask them, and then I'll have to tell you on our next call, how it worked out for me?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Sure thing. No worries at all. That just means that I get to speak with you again, that's fantastic. Yeah, amazing. In that case, one more thing that I want to highlight would be AI agents. Could you go there again, please on the left hand side next to AI?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yes.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So, AI tagging now, I do believe that you guys use tag, but correct me if I'm remembering this wrong?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Sorry, I went somewhere.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Sorry. Can you hear me? No?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  No, yes. Can you hear me?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yes. Loud and clear. Oh, gosh. Okay. Right. So, to the best of my knowledge, you do use tags in your emails. Is that correct? Yes.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yes. And I do utilize the AI tags and they've been working out pretty good. It was a little tricky for me at first because I was like not doing it properly, but I got on hiver support and somebody was able to help me streamline it so that's been great because I've been moving certain emails into a different inbox and that's actually been helping a lot and the auto tagging is great for us. I'm.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  so happy to hear that fantastic. So, could you click on the configure option next to AI tagging please? Okay. Thank you. So right now, as you can see, we can see there are two of the tags here, but they're disabled. Do you see the toggle option here? AI tagging? Yes, it's showing that these are disabled. These are the two tags that are currently added in your AI, and you can go ahead and add more tags as well, so.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  I would.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Assume that you would want to add more tags, would that be right?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yes. So.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  In that case, do you see add tag at the top? Add tags?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, from.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Here, you can select which all tags you want to add. Now, we normally recommend starting with just one or two. But now that you have used it, you have an understanding of how it works. We would recommend more number of tags. So you can use more of the AI.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. Let me do that. Go in here and manage which ones. Okay. Yeah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Here, you're seeing which emails are being assigned these tags like these tags are being applied on which emails?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. Fantastic. Okay.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So, what's happening is hiver AI is learning from these emails, the ones that you see here on your screen, which ones it needs to apply the fha, case number to. So if you can see right here, my gosh. My.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  That's okay. That's.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  horrible. But I'll try and make it a straight line here. So, if you can see this, we use 10 emails which are tagged here as learning data because hiver AI, unlike your chatgpt or gemini or any of the rest, it's non generic. It learns from you. So that whenever you use hiver AI, you get very specific, very curated response, you know, as opposed to something that is generic, you know, one size fits all. So we don't have that, which is why we recommend that the way you use it is, could you close this for me once please?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yes, thank.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  You, could you click on add tags? We can just see how it works. So we go ahead, add any one tag. You know, another one that you want to use for AI? Let's go ahead. Awesome. The tag has been added, click on manage tags here. Right there. Do we see the tag? Oh, we're not seeing the tag, just click on.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yeah.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  No, just click on train. AI. Yeah. Got it. This took a while. Now. Do you see that this tag has been newly added? And right now it's not showing up anywhere else because it has not been trained yet. So you need to click on the zero on 10 emails right there… and you notice how navigate to the shared inbox manually apply to 10 relevant conversations. Once it has been trained, then AI is going to apply those tags to relevant conversations. You don't have to go ahead and manually do that.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. So I guess I have a question. So I have an automation to apply this tag to certain emails and then it's moving it into a different inbox. If I train the hiver AI to continue to do that on because it's only doing on partial emails because obviously, we have different companies that send us different appraisals. But if I train it to utilize those, will it, it'll automatically AI tag? It will it then still drop it into the other inbox because that tag is set up as an automation… the.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Automation is going to work regardless, but at this point, there's something else you can also do which is called AI tasks. So with AI tasks, you can go ahead and add this tag using hiver AI and simultaneously add it to the mailbox. And you don't even need to do anything manually, but staying on focus here, staying on point. There's just so much on AI here. Sorry, I tend to get a little distracted, but yes, to answer your question, it's going to work. Okay, perfect. I can.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Definitely give that a try. So I.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  would recommend you to go ahead and add more tags like you've tried two of them. Now, just try adding more tags here. And as you go ahead and add those relevant emails, as soon as there are 10 emails, hiver learns that, hey, these are the ones, these are the relevant ones going forward. You don't have to apply those tags. They will be auto applied.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. That sounds great.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. There's one more thing that I want to bring your attention to, which is a third option right here. Next to AI tools, knowledge sources there's AI usage. Do you see that this is the new dashboard that we created, so we can see on the top right is a dropdown that shows you last 60 days. So you can have a 30 days, 90 days, 60 days. You can see which all… AI features and functionalities you have utilized, how much time have you saved? What's the number of actions that you have taken play, you know, so all of these can be seen. And if you scroll a little below… you see the opportunity. So hey, these are some of the things that you're currently not utilizing. Why don't you go ahead and utilize. This is an opportunity. So further below, you will also see a graph where… you will see that this is being used in. Yeah. So ask, AI is the only one that is being used right now. We would certainly recommend you use the other features as well. So you can really fully utilize hiver AI. Okay?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  All right.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  It's not used here.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  And also, one more thing I want to highlight here right now, you will see week one, week two, week three, et cetera. But this is going to be replaced by dates very soon. Again, this is something that's brand new. We're still, you know, working out, ironing out some of the, you know, creases there. But yeah, you will see the dates instead of week numbers here. I think that way the data would be more relevant.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  All right. That sounds great.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I'm glad to hear that. Okay. So that was one more thing the next thing that I want to highlight is also in terms of your automation. So could you click on the shared inboxes on the left below home?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yes. Okay.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Extreme, left? Yes. Yeah, inbox, that was the correct one. Yes. Just click on any of the shared email inboxes. We're not going to do anything. Click on automations on the left hand side. Oh, sorry, click on AI on the left hand side, first, the one just above that, and we want to see what is enabled and what is disabled. So what we just saw with the hiver AI on the left hand side, that was for your entire secure choice lending hiver account. However, because hiver functions from, on a mailbox basis, you would have to turn these on at a mailbox level. So let's see if this AI tagging is turned on, for example. So.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  So this is turned on. We can go back and… say, AI QA, could you click on AI QA? Please? Now, what AI QA does is it checks greeting, spelling and grammar, tone, clarity, completeness. All of these things. I would recommend keeping it turned on because we can also see in the analytics hiver analytics, whether your emails have all of these, whether it is complete email, et cetera, just for you to keep track, you know. So this is how you can keep track and I'll show that to you in a bit. So this is AI QA, and could you go back now, please? So we've enabled this for the appraisals mailbox, not for any of the others. And could you click on AI co pilot, please put this next to that. Everything is turned on. Fantastic. Now, could you click on automations just below AI? Could you click on create automation? We will not be saving it. So don't worry about that. Here. We also have AI capabilities. In automation. What we have is let's say a new inbound conversation is received or it could be any other trigger, really add a step. Could you just click on that? Here? We have something called AI task, AI extract. So let's first give it a condition. Let's say if condition… and give it any random condition, say the from email contains or is abc com or something like that. Enter… add step just below that. And here you can have various actions like AI extract and AI task. At this point. Anurag, are you with us here?

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Anurag, I think you, since these are, very new and you're the one that's spearheading this whole thing. Do you want to go ahead and explain to Holly a little bit about the AI extract and AI task piece?

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  Yes, for sure. So the key difference between AI extract and AI task is in AI extract, you can extract any information like invoice ids or if you have your purchase order ids and things like that. Any specific information which is mentioned in the email can be extracted with AI extract in whatever shape or format it is. And with AI task, you can do anything like you would do with chatgpt. An example for you guys could be, if someone is applying for a mortgage, identify which location the user is from, and automatically send a note. If the user is not from us, that can be a scenario. So these are the key differences I would say which… are there with AI extract and AI task, we can go ahead and try these to get a better understanding of the same. Would you like to try it out for you, Holly?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Sorry, which one AI extract or AI task?

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  You can do AI task is what I would say.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  Any example on top of your mind, which comes, which you would like to explore?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Let's see. Let's just do this. Okay.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  Minimum 20 characters you have to prompt has to be something. So you can say that if someone is talking about appraisal in the email?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can just type it in if the sender is, or if the, you know, if someone is talking about appraisal in the email. So it can be in a colloquial language, no problem.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. Which was good.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, this creates a variable, a list of variables and the top variable which you can see, is appraisal received. Now, if any email has appraisal, this variable will turn as true. And you can set up any automation on top of this. Okay. So you can save and add if you want to, and we can then add a block of any automation if you want to do.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. You.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  Can go down, add step.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  If condition… select condition… that will be AI variable, the… AI variables, you can select the variable?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Should I select all of just one? Yeah.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  Just one or you can choose more as well with an, or condition or an, and condition, you can kind of play around with that. Okay?

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  Enter keyword, you can do it true… type true. There. Not this, you can see in the keyword.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Enter a keyword. Sorry… okay.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  You can type.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  You said clue. True?

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  It's a true statement. Yeah, true. True, that's it, you can. Then if this is met, you can add any other action as next step.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  You can click on action.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Action. Okay. Select an action. Okay? Select action, and.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  you can do anything with the email you want. Okay?

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  Cool. So that's a quick of a… quick view of what you can do with a AI task. Okay?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  All right.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  So, basically, in a way, you can run any kinds of automation or workflows which you want with this, and it doesn't need to be like a particular keyword is mentioned, AI can interpret information as well that if someone is talking about higher amounts of loans, it might be mortgage and things like that.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. Is there anything else needed to do on this specific thing? Oh, so.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  I think Holly, what you can do is this was of course just an example, but, you know, you can, you get an idea of how it can be used. And the reason I wanted Anurag to explain is because this is something very new. I myself am not very well versed with it. So I was, you know, using this as a learning opportunity for myself as well. But having said that what you can do is on the left hand side, you see the automation summary, right? So it explains to you, if you click on more, you'll see the full thing where it explains to you what exactly you just created. So when the first email comes in and if it, you know, fits certain criteria, in that case, go ahead and perform these actions. So it typically works exactly like any other automation on hiver. But the difference here is that unlike any other automation, if you scroll up, you will see just scroll up a little bit to the if condition. Yeah, fantastic. So in any other automation on hiver, it's a little more rigid here. Like, you know, you have to give the exact variable for example, like if the sender is saying these things in the subject line, right? Or if this is there, if this keyword is there in the body and so on. However with AI, what happens is if you say something like, hey, if this, you know, go ahead and say that the email subject line contains someone talking about appraisals or someone talking about their mortgage, go ahead and apply the tag mortgage. So it's a lot more flexible in that sense. Does that answer any question at all? Sorry?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yes, that makes a lot of sense.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, yeah, I'm that is definitely something that you can play around with as well and see if you find it useful. I hope you will.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  I'll give it a try and I will let you know sure.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Sure, of course, we are getting on another call soon anyway. So please do give it a try. Let me know. And for now, we are not going to save this automation, of course. So could you on the left hand side, the arrow, could you click on that left? Yeah, thank you leave. And finally, one last thing that I also want to show you before letting you go because I think we've overshot a little bit. Could you close the admin panel please?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yes, I can. And.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Let's go to analytics right here on the left. Thank you. And here you will notice there's something new. Okay. Let's select another mailbox. Could she maybe help desk or something? Oh, there we go. No, no, no. Aiqa is not there. Oh, let's see. Okay. Yeah, scroll down, please. There you go. Now, do you see that mark Trent and Terry have been well? Aiqa, I'm not sure. Okay. They're part of this mailbox and aiqa has been enabled for this particular mailbox. We need to go ahead and enable mailbox by mailbox. The other ones have not been enabled. So, you notice how their emails are getting scored. So, are these emails personalized? Are they clear? Do they have a greeting? You know, all of these things. Now you might want to keep all of them enabled. You might want to say, okay, I just want to see spelling and grammar and completeness and personalization, or maybe just the tone depends on your use case. So that is something that you can fix as well. And I'll show you how to do that. But any questions here before we move to that bit? No. Okay. Awesome. So in that case, could you go to the admin panel again? Please, on the top, right next to the bell icon, admin panel? Yep. Fantastic. Could you click on AI? We're in the appraisals mailbox. So, could you click on AI? Okay. And do you see aiqa, which is the second option? Configure? Yes?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Configure?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. It's turned on. So the way it works, I think we just did it, right? So the way it works is it is forward facing, we're not going to be able to see the emails, you know, for all of these for what's happened in the past. So this is going to be from today. If we enabled it today, then today, onward all of the emails. So here, you get to see that. Hey, maybe I don't care too much about the tone, then you can disable it or, you know, you can go ahead and configure it for those. So, for example, you see the gear icon on the right of your cursor, click on that. There you go. So you see highlights all typos rating scale, binary, et cetera. So this is something that you can see, this is the configuration of this particular, you know, criterion. You can close this. And from here, you can enable disable whichever one is relevant for you. Furthermore, you can also exclude certain domains. So if you click on excluded domains on the top on the right, just above the toggles there. So emails from these domains will not be evaluated by aiqa. So this is also something that you can do. So, maybe… you know, a Gmail com or something like that. Okay. And as you can see internal emails which are an email shared within the same inbox within the inbox, they are not considered for aiqa. Okay. Any questions here? No. Okay. Cool. Could you cancel that please?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yes, I can. And.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  One last thing that I want to show you, could you close the admin panel? Yes. Awesome. And in the, I think we were in the appraisals mailbox. So, could you open an email in the appraisals mailbox, something you're comfortable opening on screen? Okay. Awesome. So here, could you click on reply? We're not going to reply. So you can just delete remove all the replies. Could you just remove the recipients here? So we don't go ahead and accidentally send a reply? Awesome. Now, just, could you type in some, something at random and, it could be, you know, bad grammar and spelling mistakes. All kinds of, you know, yeah.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Sorry, it's like tiny. I don't know why it's tiny?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, just, yeah, make it normal. Fantastic. Okay. Awesome. Great. Now, what we'll do is I'm just going to annotate it a star at the very bottom. Yes, click on that. Could you click on fixed grammar and spelling?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. Oh.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Gosh. Why is that not happening? Could you refresh that? It's.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  probably too good for it. It's it's probably.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  A little confused with what they mean by grammar. Okay? Could you try that again?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yes, let's try it that way.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Try fixing grammar and spelling. Oh, there you go. There we go.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  So that's.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  something the, could you click there again? There's quite a few options that I wanted to show. So, click there and say, make it empathetic or make it professional, improve writing. So… just, could you click on this? There's probably a little less information for them to do anything about it. Just close this and if you can add maybe a couple more lines there?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let's see. Okay. You can, do, you know, you can do a lot more with this. Yeah.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  If,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  you know, for a more relevant content, typically, you can do a lot more with this. But yeah, this is something that you can do with hiver AI where, okay, you know, if you want to fix grammar, you want to fix the writing, you don't have to, well, typically, a lot of us tend to do this. I've done it in the past before using this is using chatgpt. So you go ahead and copy, paste the whole thing and then you just go and chatgpt it and then you paste the whole thing again.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Horrible. That's.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  so time consuming. So, with hiver AI, you don't have to do that. You can just do it directly here using AI compose.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. It.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Should work normally. I'm not sure why it's saying, can't perform the task, Anurag, if you're there, I'm not sure if you're still there any reason why AI compose is not performing these tasks for Holly, it's working normally for me.

Anurag (anurag.s@grexit.com):
  I think the only reason I can think of right now is limited data which Holly is feeding,

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  So, I can definitely give it a try for the next few like days or weeks and see if it's how it's going, it probably just needs a little bit, to get up and running since I just turned it on. Yes.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Likely, likely. And are you part of other mailboxes as well, or are you only going to be trying from the appraisals mailbox? I.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Have condos and appraisal desk as well as an additional inbox that we, I manage.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. And would you want to enable these for those other mailboxes as well or do you want to get started with just this first?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  I'll probably do that for condos when we get off. I only have one team member in there, but I would love to see how her tone is and stuff like that appraisal desk. We don't really respond to it's. Mainly just send out. So I don't think it would work for appraisal desk because nobody's actually sending an email on appraisal desk.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Ah, right. Yes. In that case, please do turn it on for the others as well. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. So those were in fact some of the things that we wanted to show you. But having said that, what are your thoughts?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  I'm definitely excited to try out like the, once it will work, the AI configure or whatever this is. Sorry, AI compose, because I know my team sometimes it's hard to make something sound professional when, you know, you get a snippy email or make something sound sincere or, you know, just kind of make sometimes you, you're just like off in space and you need some help, you know, making it make sense.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  So, I'm excited to show them this and give them, let them try it and hopefully it'll help everyone out, instead of going because we do use chatgbt a lot to like. And we'll say like make this better. Like, so I'm hoping that will help us.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And yeah, let us know what you think about it once you've had a chance to use it, and I really hope that this works out well for you and it saves your time. I mean, frankly speaking, you know, the core purpose is increasing efficiency here. So that's really what we hope to do. But yes, we'd love to hear your feedback on this.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay. Yeah, totally.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Great. So I personally don't have anything additional to add here, but Anurag, is there anything at all that you want to add at this point? No, nothing from my side. We are good. Okay. Awesome. And yes, Holly, like I mentioned, you know, Anurag is pi heading AI features and functionalities at hiver. So he is really the man for all things AI at hiver. So, Anurag, thank you so much for joining this call. I know it's really late for you. So thank you so much and Holly, let's connect again. When do you recommend?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Probably. Okay. Let me look at my calendar.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  I'm trying to see if I have anything scheduled in the next two weeks. I don't so we could probably do something February nine through the thirteenth. If you guys are available to reconnect.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  100 percent. My ninth is looking, very busy. Can we do eleventh?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  That seems doable. I don't have anything for that day.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. And do you want it to be this time or a little earlier a little later? What works for you?

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  This time works great for me. So, 10 30?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Fantastic. Let me go ahead and send it across right away. Okay. So that's going to be February eleventh. This is the same time and hiver… AI?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. You should be receiving an email from me anytime now.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Okay, perfect. Once I get it, I will accept it. There it is… yes.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Awesome. Okay, cool. So thank you so much, Holly for your time and I see we've overshot by quite a bit. Sorry about being long winded here, but I really hope that, thank you. I really hope that you found this meeting to be useful and I will be sharing a recording of this call, lots of recorders here. So, yeah… definitely sharing a call recording with you for at least one of these, and yeah, please do give it a try and do also discuss with mark and Trent if they want to participate in the next call. If they're interested, then of course, please ask them to join in the call as well. And I'd be happy to demonstrate AI features functionalities and address any questions that they might have, because I remember mark being very keen, very eager to understand what more hiver can do with, from an AI perspective. So, I'd love to chat with him and respond to any questions you might have. Perfect.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yeah, I'll get with mark and see if he's able to join us on our next call. And if not, then we'll probably, then I could try and reschedule. So he is available to join us sure.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Sure. That'll be fantastic.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  All right. Do you have anything else for me? I?

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Don't but it's been a pleasure speaking with you, Holly. Thank you so much for your time. Really appreciate it and let's speak again very soon.

Holly Gamble (holly@securechoicelending.com):
  Yeah, of course. I appreciate you too. I'll talk to you later.

Udita P (udita.p@grexit.com):
  Speak soon. Bye. Take care. Bye, thanks, mark.
