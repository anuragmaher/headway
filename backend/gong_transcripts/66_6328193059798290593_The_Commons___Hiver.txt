================================================================================

Mugunth:
  hi, Kerri. Hi, Elizabeth. How are you doing?

Elizabeth Howells:
  Hi, how are you going?

Mugunth:
  I'm doing good. Thanks for asking. How are you?

Elizabeth Howells:
  Very well. Thank you. Thanks so much for making the time today.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. Hi, mugunth. How are you?

Mugunth:
  I'm doing good, Kerri, thanks for asking. How are you?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Good. Thank you.

Mugunth:
  Is anyone else joining this meeting or it's just going to be okay?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Got it. Just the two of us from the comments. Yeah. Okay.

Mugunth:
  Got it. So, Elizabeth, Kerri, did you get a chance to review the email which Aishwarya has just sent it to you because when we just received an email, we just wanted to analyze the logs but to try to find the underlying pattern which kind of triggered that mess and all those steps. So, Aishwarya and the support team did the thorough analysis and they kind of, you know, help you with why this is happening. Yeah?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Thank you. Yeah, no, it was, I appreciated that coming through before our meeting today, it was very helpful.

Mugunth:
  Yes, yes. So, I just wanted to have that clarified to you because that would kind of, you know, help us have a productive discussion. So, since we are meeting for the first time, maybe we could start off with a quick round of introduction and I could kind of, you know, walk you through the agenda. I have been working today, so maybe I can go first myself, mugunth, Raj, please feel free to call me for both.

Mugunth:
  I'll be your dedicated customer success manager here at hiver, as my role indicates, I'm here to ensure that my customers are successful by using hiver, ensure that they get the maximum value out of hiver, in simpler terms, you could think me as a consultant who will help you with the best practices workflow recommendations to streamline your workflow. So that's basically what I do day in and day out as a CSM at hiver. We'll just quickly understand your role, add comments and then we can take it forward from there.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, sure. So, I've only been with the company for a very short time now. So I've started as the inquiries manager. So basically, me and my team look after first point of contact for all membership inquiries and well as meeting rooms and events. So we work across the commons, our sister brands forum and central house. So, yeah, we're kind of first point of contact for everyone who wants to join us or become a member and come into our spaces.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Understood. Okay.

Elizabeth Howells:
  And mugunth, I'm Lizzie, I take care of operations for the commons. So I'm here because I'm really interested in obviously we've launched hiver… which has been really great. And this response to the email was really fantastic too. So I really want to have a thorough understanding of our automations of our workflow setup so that we can tweak them, refine, them, keep making them better in future. I think where we could really get some help from you is like if we can share some use cases with you and then you can tell us in hiver, this is the best way for you to match that and like handle that. And then if you can help us to, I guess on the administrative side of the workflow setups, help upskill me so that we can handle a lot of this stuff ourselves.

Mugunth:
  Definitely, definitely Elizabeth. You know, thanks for making that easier for me. The agenda I had in mind today is to kind of, you know, better understand your use case. So I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions, get to know your workflow better once that's done. What we could do is we could proceed with, you know, I'll walk you through the argument panel and I'll walk you through what are all available in your pro plan and how we would set up automations, slas, csats, and so on. Once that's done, what I could even do is I can also help you with the user training. We have a close to seven number team, right? Based on a convenient time slot. I can also walk you through the user training just to help with the marketing. I know that you have gone live, but if that helps I'm even open to help you with a, you know, a quick refresher training to your team members so that they could swiftly navigate through hiver.

Elizabeth Howells:
  That would be great. So we.

Mugunth:
  should ideally be capping it up at the max by more than two calls that's how much I need for, to complete this whole activity excluding the one we are doing today. So, yeah. Okay, Elizabeth, I just noticed that you currently have five shared mailboxes. One is, hello at commons and virtual there's. Also something called forum workspace, central house. During the course of conversation, you mentioned that the forum workspace and central house is a sister company of yours, right?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Sorry, sorry, I'll step in Kerry. Yeah, that's correct. So, the commons is a kind of the brands group. And then we have sister brands that sit underneath the function and operations day to day of those businesses is exactly the same. It's just white labels and it's a different domain. I still have a challenge and I think I've reached out to your team. I'm going to have to contact Google for support here because I can't get up so that we can send from forum workspace, at forumworkspace, com, au, and at centralhouse, com, au, using hiver, I can't set that up at the moment because Google has made some changes I think in the last month to the way that you set up smtp servers and I just can't actually do it. So I'm going to have to contact Google to help with that.

Mugunth:
  Okay. But that could be easily done with the Google settings. Did the support team help you with that process?

Elizabeth Howells:
  I think they did well. I think they tried, but can I share my screen? Do you mind if we try and do it right now? Yes, we.

Mugunth:
  Could do that. We could try doing that.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Okay, great. Can you hold on. Sorry, I haven't used zoom in a while. Hold on. I'm just going to have to come right back. Just give me one sec.

Mugunth:
  Sure. Please pick it up.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Hello. Thank you. Sorry, guys. All right. This is the desktop. All right. You can see my inbox now?

Mugunth:
  Yeah.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Okay. So tell me how I can try and change these settings because I have tried and I can't get it to work.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Just tap on the settings, the Google level settings.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Do I need to do this? So right now, this is like Lizzie at thecommons com. Au, what inbox do I need to do this from? Change these settings?

Mugunth:
  Let's say that you want to kind of, you know, send out an email from, let's say that, hello at commons. Com, you need to make that particular email address as a default. So that is something which we need to do it at the Google level.

Elizabeth Howells:
  So, if I log into, hello… at thecommons com, au, will that do it? Yeah.

Mugunth:
  Yes. Can I just close this app? Maybe we could try it from the one, the previously opened app itself. Yeah, please just tap on the settings here for me. Yeah… please go to see all settings. Could you go to the outcomes? So right now, if you see here, what's currently present is, you know, Lizzie at commons. Com is kind of, you know, present as the default email address. Instead, let's say that you want to make events at commons. Com as an email address, just tap on this option as main default… yep.

Mugunth:
  That's it. So now, can you just go to any one of the emails?

Mugunth:
  See? Yeah. So.

Elizabeth Howells:
  The problem I'm having though is when I go to add another email address, I want to use this.

Mugunth:
  One? Okay.

Elizabeth Howells:
  A different domain?

Mugunth:
  Okay. And,

Elizabeth Howells:
  so, when I try to do this, I… don't know what that means and I don't know how to get around it. I'm a super admin of our Google workspace because I don't… know how to resolve that.

Mugunth:
  Okay. And so what we can do is after this meeting, I can even schedule a quick call with the support team or after we end the discussion. Maybe I can also bring in the support team. I think there is a workaround maybe we could achieve this with the help of the aliases. So just give me some time. We could get this done. There is one settings which needs to be done. Maybe let's see whether that works. I think we could do that. But if it's just one email address, this is the procedure. You just need to make one particular email address as a default. Once you make that, all the emails will be sent from that particular, you know, the common chat.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Yeah. The issue I'm having is I can't add hello at centralhouse. Com, au, and also hello at forumworkspace. Com au, which means they're not in the dropdown. When the team goes to like reply to an email, it's not an option.

Mugunth:
  Understood. So you want all your, you know, the common health and last place the central house in addition to the, hello at comments. Com?

Elizabeth Howells:
  Yeah, that's right? Because we have the hello for forum here for example. And so if we're going to respond to an email that's in here, we actually need to be able to respond from, hello at forumworkspace. Com. Au.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Understood. Okay. I have a follow up question. I understand that comments is the parent company and central house. And, you know, what do you call one?

Elizabeth Howells:
  More forum?

Mugunth:
  Forum workspace. Yeah, are your sister companies? Why can't we just kind of, you know, route all the inquiries to comments. Let's have comments as one external facing, you know, email address, and from there, if it's for forum and for central house, could we kind of, you know, split it internally or this needs to have operators as individual entities as a whole? Yeah.

Elizabeth Howells:
  I mean, ideally individual entities because they have completely different websites, they are different brands. When people interact with the forum brand, they don't necessarily know that it's the commons or when they interact with the commons, they don't necessarily know that it's central house. And from a branding experience, if I've inquired on the forum website, and then I get a response from the commons. Com au, it's very confusing for the customer.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Understood. Thanks for clarifying that because there's also one alternative workaround which I could have proposed. So that's why I kind of asked you whether these all these five share mailboxes. Do they need to operate as a separate entity or could we just kind of consolidate them as a one single entity? And internally, we could split and work among the customers. Thanks for making that clear and sorry… Elizabeth, were you saying something?

Elizabeth Howells:
  No, I just said good.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Got it. So what type of email inquiries do you get in all these shared mailboxes? Assuming that you offer the shared co, working spaces? So do the customers reach out to you to book meeting rooms or office spaces? Is that how the inquiries are? Could you just walk me through the typical type of inquiries? Yeah.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Of course. So there's yeah, a few different sources that we receive inquiries. Salesforce is our main CRM, I guess where we house all of our membership inquiries, we do all of our invoicing for meeting rooms, and that works in turn with the memberships team. So inquiries come through the website directly. So that form goes right through to Salesforce. We get inquiries of people emailing us directly to, hello at the commons. We get phone call inquiries. We get Facebook ads and Google ads, people submitting interest via our marketing. I think that's it phone Google, Facebook website, directly, email directly. Okay. So, yeah, there's a few different sources where our inquiries come from.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Understood. So let's assume that our customer is kind of filling out this inquiry form in the website. Does this also kind of, you know, gets captured as an email and gets sent to your chat mailbox. Is that how the work goes?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Exactly. Yeah.

Mugunth:
  Okay. And when the customer email you, that would also come directly to your chat mailbox, and what about the Facebook ads? Does that also come as an email as a new inquiry? Yeah.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  So that is linked to Salesforce. So to our CRM. So it goes to both?

Mugunth:
  Yeah. Okay. Got.

Elizabeth Howells:
  It. So Kerri, can I ask with that? Sorry, does that mean it just creates a lead in Salesforce? And you get a lead notification? Or do you get an email? Like what can you, where can I, how can I find one so that we can actually look at one of?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  These? So if you go… to team and go to my name on the left? Kerri, yeah. Yeah, there should be one. Yeah. So that's why it's everywhere. So.

Elizabeth Howells:
  From a workflow perspective, what happens is for this form when it gets filled out in, these website forms, and when there's a meta ads or any other type of an ad related thing that just automatically creates a lead in Salesforce, right? That's the first thing that happens, then Salesforce automates this email notification for our inquiries team. So that our inquiries team goes, I have a new lead in Salesforce that I need to take action on. So, this type of an email is probably the most common type of email that they get. And it is, it's just purely a notification. Okay. Is that right? Kerri? Correct?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah. And from there, we action that membership inquiries from Salesforce. So we don't email directly back to the notification. It's more of a, we need to do this. So we jump back into Salesforce.

Mugunth:
  Oh, okay. So for those inquiries, then you kind of use the Salesforce and from Salesforce, you are sending out the emails and following up. Okay. Yeah. Got it. That could be even a phone follow ups, you know?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Checking. Yeah. Okay. Exactly. Yep. So, Salesforce logs, all of our phone calls alongside the inquiries. Yeah.

Mugunth:
  Okay. So you typically do a phone follow ups, they're not an email follow ups if it's coming through the meta ads or, yeah, thanks for the clarification. So, my understanding so far is all these five shag mailboxes are used to handle the inquiry forms apart from inquiries. Do you receive any other type of requests coming into this shag mailbox?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Lots of, so we do, virtual office is a membership. So we deal with a lot of virtual office billing, membership, terminations, membership extensions. So, yeah, I'm not just it's.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Kind of a mix of new inquiries. So new leads coming through this inbox. It's also a significant amount of customer support. And so that might be like our existing customers asking questions about their memberships. This is kind of another main point of contact that they will go to. Okay? These are the central inboxes. So I reckon it's probably from looking at it myself 50 50 customer support.

Mugunth:
  Got it. So you also do let's say that let's say apple has booked a co working space and they have bought in as a new customer. Once they have been kind of, you know, offered the membership, you would be kind of, you know, providing them with one dedicated point of contact. Let's say that for Amazon, it's going to be Keri and if it's apple, it's going to be Elizabeth. You also do that post purchase of membership, right? You also do?

Elizabeth Howells:
  Yeah. So in some ways, yeah. So there are some sort of sorts of memberships where it's like we'll give you, this is the email address. And so the email address might be virtual at thecommons com au because you have this specific type of membership. And if you have any questions or queries that's who looks after you. Whereas for some cases, it might be like here's, a specific person who's not on Kerry's team, who looks after you. Okay?

Mugunth:
  So you also, my understanding is that more like for a VIP customers or high ticket customer, you can also provide them with a dedicated point of contact so that you could quickly respond to the queries. Okay?

Elizabeth Howells:
  Yeah, sort of. So we're a shared workspace, co, working spaces. We have 19 locations. Every location has a community manager. So if you have a private office in a location, the community manager of that office is your main point of contact.

Mugunth:
  Okay. And they are a part of this seven number team, right? Who's using the shared mailbox or they are not part of it?

Elizabeth Howells:
  They're not part of it although I think I would quite like them to use hiver one day, but we need to wrap our heads around how we're using it now.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Got it. Okay. So your team predominantly handles the new inquiries and also for the support for the existing customers, you're not necessarily the point of contact for your existing customers. Okay? Got it.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  It's a lot to get your head around.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Yeah. Understood. Okay. And right now, when I was just looking at your workflow, I understood that you have set up an auto assignment functionality. So based on this, my understanding is that so pretty much everyone in your team can work on any type of inquiries or requests coming in your way, right? So there are no specialized agents or seasoned folks who need to handle certain type of requests or inquiries.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  No, we're a very small team, and we manage quite a large amount of inquiries. So it is best practice for us to all be across all of our brands, all of our offerings. Yes, we do have a member of my team prefers virtual office, a member of my team prefers events, but if that's quiet one day, then we can all jump in and assist where required if needed.

Mugunth:
  Understood. Thanks for clarifying that. And I see that you have been using the tags for the, you know, the users who are present in the group also. Do you classify the emails like you get a bunch of inquiries or requests? Few would be pertaining to the new business inquiries. Few might be kind of, you know, supporting your existing customers currently. Do you classify them or is that something which you haven't set up or thought about?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Do you mean tag? Yes?

Mugunth:
  Tags to classify the incoming emails? Like, you know, this set?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Of emails? I don't know if we have anything set up manually, but we do have tags set up. We probably need to be better at using them for filing an organization, but yes, we do have them and we do use them. Yeah.

Mugunth:
  I could see a lot of tags being created like, you know, for the list. This is what I was asking. Okay, but you aren't using it because of the manual process. Okay? Thanks for that. We could automate this process. We.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Could automate that?

Mugunth:
  Yes, we could automate that. So I don't want to rush into the solution side, you know, I'm just I'm covering your use cases. So in the next session, it's going to be solutioning and quantification. So, yeah, please bear with me into this session.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, no, I think what I mentioned the other day is emails coming through to us into the unassigned inbox and how we can quickly resolve that today if possible.

Mugunth:
  Yes, we could do that. Yeah, that.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Would be fantastic. So yeah, I can move.

Elizabeth Howells:
  That, hello here. And there's four that are unassigned.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  So that top one is an inbound email. So we have had no contact with them. Why hasn't it assigned email to someone to action? Oh, so Neil, unassigned?

Mugunth:
  Neil has unassigned this email. So basically, this email was assigned to Neil through auto assignment. After that, he kind of, you know, applied a tag and then made this unassigned email. So that's why it has been to the unassigned.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Queue.

Mugunth:
  so, Kerri, Elizabeth, maybe I can explain the workflow here. So what auto assignment does is it… would basically kind of, you know, it would look for all the agents who are available at that particular time slot. And let's say that there are 10 inquiries coming. What it will do is if you, we three are there, it will assign one ticket to me, second to you, third to Elizabeth in a round Robin fashion. It kind of, you know, assigns all your incoming requests. So that's the workflow. So, could you just tap on the admin panel? Maybe I can explain it to you? Yeah, you want.

Elizabeth Howells:
  me to go to admin?

Mugunth:
  Yes, please go to the admin panel. Yeah. Is.

Elizabeth Howells:
  that here? No?

Mugunth:
  This one, this one, yeah, yeah, please go there. And could you just go to any one of the chat mailboxes? I see that you have set it up auto assignment for all the chat mailboxes. Maybe you could go to the, hello comments. Could you tap on auto assignment? Yeah. So if you see here auto assignment functionality will work only for your inbound conversation. Could you just tap on this drop down? It doesn't work on any outbound conversation. That's why Aishwarya suggested us to kind of, you know, set up an automation tool in such a way that let's say that if I'm sending out an outbound email?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  That.

Mugunth:
  particular email gets assigned to me, auto assigned to me rather than it being in the unassigned queue. And then you or Elizabeth needs to review it, assign it to one of the six or seven agents of the chat.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Mailbox. So.

Mugunth:
  This is the functionality of auto assignment. Basically any inbound emails received… during your business hours, it gets auto assigned to all the members within your team. And you also get an option to set some limits. Let's say that at a certain point of time, you want only your agents to have like 20 or 30 queries. You could set that limit. Let's say that Kerry has reached that limit, it will skip you and move to Elizabeth if she hasn't hit that threshold of 30 open emails, so.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Where I did have this set up but I've turned it off because of working across the four inboxes. It was, I think I mentioned it. Hiver doesn't recognize where one person might be imbalanced across events, central house, forum. Hello. So I did turn it off because it is a little bit easier to manage. Neil might have been at capacity and events, and then he might have started getting into capacity at hello, but it doesn't recognize that one person's workload across the four inboxes.

Mugunth:
  Yeah, it doesn't recognize one person's inbox across four shared mailboxes, because the way the shared mailbox was set up is to have all these four shared mailbox operate as in separate and individual entity with complete silos and ownership and autonomy that's how the shared mailbox has been created. Say, for instance, from the same organization, HR team would be using it, finance team would be using it. They don't want the HR team to access the finance team's content. So that's how these shared mailbox was created. Whether an automation, an SLA whatsoever, or let's say that csat, if you're setting something up, it's tied to a particular shared mailbox. These features which you're seeing right now are tied to the hello or comments. Com. If you are setting up an automation tool here, we also need to go back and do that for the other four shared mailboxes, that's how hiver works. It doesn't kind of, you know, operate universally across all four shared mailboxes. It's intended behavior?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Can you?

Mugunth:
  Understand what's the volume of emails received across all these five shared mailboxes? Is there any… like certain shared mailbox? Do they receive high volume of emails? Do they receive low volume of emails? Yeah.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Our main one would be hello at the comments. Com. Au, yeah.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Understood. Unfortunately, there is no worker on the solution for this. So, because your four agents are kind of, you know, spread across all these four shared mailboxes, and these are all separate… entities. It's not that you could merge them because we have a separate website and separate, you know, entities operating out of it. So we cannot club, but I'll take this internally with the team. To my best of knowledge, there isn't any solution but we could kind of, you know, work on solutions and all those stuff or how we could automate the manual assignment process and all those stuff. That is something which we could.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Easily do. Yeah, that would be, that would be wonderful to look into. Yeah. What?

Elizabeth Howells:
  About, can we, maybe, I think it might be good if we can look again at the ones that are unassigned. Okay? And if you can like still just to make sure that we fully understand?

Mugunth:
  Yes. Yeah.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Yeah. So, okay. This.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  One, this one… yeah.

Elizabeth Howells:
  So, this one's unassigned, yeah?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  This, okay, new conversation is received. Hiver changed the post to open and changed it to.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Peace. Okay. Interesting.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  This one?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Four hours ago, but,

Mugunth:
  this looks like an outbound email which was sent, right? So.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  I see that the guest has emailed back six minutes, sorry, nine minutes later. And even though Angelica's email, hello at the commons, it should have, should it have assigned back to her? Okay?

Mugunth:
  Okay. Got it. Thanks for pointing this out. So, basically, what we have done here is we have set up an auto assignment to handle only the income queries. Like I mentioned earlier, the first event which took place is the outbound email being sent by who's.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  this person. So, yeah.

Mugunth:
  Angelica? Okay. So that's why I didn't assign this email. It's still sitting in the understand. We could automate this process. Could you just go to the admin panel?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  If we can set it up while we're on, yeah, click on.

Mugunth:
  Click on a create automation, click… on what? Sorry?

Elizabeth Howells:
  One.

Mugunth:
  Minute. Let me just annotate it for you. It is a stamp on create automation. Yep. Yeah, here, select the trigger as when an outbound conversation is sent, yes. Yes. Yeah. Yes, select that add step, select… if condition, if condition, yeah, here, select the containers body… yeah, contains, put the name of the person. Let's say that you could, for testing purpose, you could put either your email address, your name, Elizabeth, I.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Yeah. Well, that's obviously not going to be sustainable, right? So, basically, I want it to be, if I send an email out, if someone responds to that response to that email, it should be auto assigned to me. Okay? And I want to be able to change people. I don't have to update the automation every time. Yeah.

Mugunth:
  No, no, no. So basically, what we are going to do is we are going to set up this seven automation rules. What happens is if you are sending out an outbound email, this email gets assigned to you. So it doesn't wait for your customer to kind of, you know, send out any new email responses to you. So whenever you send out any outbound email, that particular email gets assigned to you rather than it's sitting in the under sink that's what we are kind of, you know, setting up the automation for.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

Mugunth:
  So, just type in your name, exactly how you put it in the email signature… that's it hit enter… yep… hit enter. Yeah, now, add step.

Elizabeth Howells:
  No.

Mugunth:
  No, no. Could you just go to the add step? Yeah… select the action… under the select action, select, assign to… and select the user here as Angelica. Yeah.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Okay. So my question on, this is great. The problem though is if Angelica leaves the business and a new person starts, I'm going to have to update this automation.

Elizabeth Howells:
  So how can we make it so that it's not about the body of the email? Can we use an if condition that's about who sent it?

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  And Angelica is part time. So, Angelica only works three days a week. So we need to make sure that anything that's coming through to her when she's unassigned, she is marked as unavailable on Thursday and Friday that they're coming through to other team members? Oh.

Mugunth:
  Okay. This is an interesting. So, okay. So not all seven members in your team, they do the full time. So there are some part time workers part of it as well. Okay. Could you just help me understand that structure? Let's say that there are seven. I see that one person has already excluded from handling incoming, but there are six person in this. How many are part time workers? How many are full time workers of commons? Or, you know, just.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, just one part timer who's Angelica. So she worked Monday through to Wednesday and then the rest of us are full time, Monday to Friday.

Mugunth:
  Okay. Understood. Okay. This is something I need to validate. But for others, if we set up this automation rule, it kind of, you know, it's auto assigned. Let's say that if you are sending out an email, it gets assigned to you, it's still tapped to you for Angelica alone. Let me just preview and come back if there is any local solution because.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  she works on Monday, same for sick days or annual leave. Like what would be the solution if someone's off sick for a day there?

Mugunth:
  Are two things which we could do, Kerri, if someone is out of office, what we could do is we could, since we are running this automation based on their availability, we could kind of, you know, move these emails to unassigned queues and you as a supervisor or Elizabeth could review it and assign it to the other agents that's one way of doing it, or we could use some other functionality called assign among but that isn't available in your program. So, I think, let me just try to understand your workflow better because I don't think jumping into the solution right now would be the best way forward because we are hitting with the roadblocks here. So let me uncover your case better so that we could preserve the, you know, the solution into the next session. What are your thoughts on this? Yeah.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  Yeah, I always ahead of the day or if I know someone's going to be off, I'll always mark them as unavailable on the little team availability. So, yeah, it's.

Mugunth:
  more.

Kerri Shuttleworth (kerri@thecommons.com.au):
  just that those emails if they're unavailable are getting reassigned. Okay?

Mugunth:
  Got it. Because there's there are ways to kind of, you know, achieve things, say, for instance, we could even skip abdica, let's say that whenever and right now the trigger which we have used is outbound percent.

Mugunth:
  So whenever an outbound email is sent, and we could also set up an automation rule saying that the body contains, we could exclude Angelica and assign the conversations among the five other folks who are the full timers, but that isn't part of your plan. But let me just try to understand the use case. And then I'll come up with the recommendations, then we could take it for the features, functionality, the solution functionality, thank.

Elizabeth Howells:
  You. Yeah. Okay. It would be great as well. If we didn't I just, this doesn't feel like the right solution for me. It can't be typing manually in to this condition, the name of the staff member, because in five years, we might hire 30 more people. And that means every time we hire a new person or off board, someone I'm going to have to go update this automation. So I don't think that's going to work for us. What I need here is an if condition that's to do with the user who originally sent the email. So the user that sent the email needs to be automatically reassigned back to them.

Mugunth:
  Yeah, we could do that. Could you just go to the top? No, no, no, not, the second under the if condition instead of body, select from, yeah… type in the email address of Anthony. But.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Again, same same thing, right? Because if Angelica leaves, then I'm going to have to go in and delete it. So I need hiver, every email that comes out of that inbox is going to come from, hello at thecommons com. Au, but I need hiver to know the user that sent that email and reassign that response back to that same user.

Mugunth:
  Got it. So there are two ways through which we could currently do it, Elizabeth, either by identifying the email address from which it's sent. If it's sent from Elizabeth, it will be reassigned or if the body contains Elizabeth, we could assign it. So these are the identifiers which the hiver looks to automate the whole process. If it's not present in the front email address, if it's not present in the body, we technically cannot run an automation tool that we should only manually assign all the conversations that's the challenge we have here. Okay? So either we should go by the email address or the body, okay?

Elizabeth Howells:
  All right. We can discuss that. So the just so that I understand the reason that this email response was unassigned is because it was a response? Yes?

Mugunth:
  It was an outbound email. So it's not an inbound email. Had it, let's say that if Nick has sent you an email, this would have ideally been assigned to either one of the six agents who are available at that particular time. But since this was an email which was initiated by Angelica, it went to the unassigned queue. Okay?

Elizabeth Howells:
  And that's something maybe if you can go away and come back to us because like I said, our team here is a blend 50 percent sales. Okay, customer service. So, it's hiver's working really well on the customer service side. Yes, from a sales side, they're going outbound a lot, there's quite a lot outbound. They're going to find emails. They're contacting people. Maybe we're trying to, we get email lists and we're emailing people who might be in the area to sell to them. So we need a way to capture, this inbound. This, this, the response to our outbound email? Okay?

Mugunth:
  Sure. We could do that short on time. Can we connect sometime same time tomorrow to go? This? Let's just finish this completely. Let me just uncover your use case and then I can help you. So can I just book a time slot for same time tomorrow? Quick 15, 20 minutes to go, the remaining set of the workflow questions. Once that's completed, I'll work on the solutioning and then I'll come back to you with a better solution.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Yep, that'll be good. Okay?

Mugunth:
  I'll kind of, you know, create a meeting invite for same time tomorrow, and then we can take it forth. Okay?

Elizabeth Howells:
  Great. Thank you. No.

Mugunth:
  Worries at all. So as well, do not worry. I mean, like there are like 10 or at least there are a couple of ways through which we could arrive at a solution once I get the hang of your workflow. Now that you're also I'm educating you about how the hydro works, we could definitely work on a solution that would kind of, you know, streamline the manual process which your team is currently going through right now. So that's for me. So please be rest assured. Sounds good.

Elizabeth Howells:
  Thank you so much for good. See you. Appreciate the time, yeah.

Mugunth:
  See you tomorrow bye.
