Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  hello?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Hello. How are you, Chelsea?

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  I'm doing well. How are you?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Doing well.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  So, it looks like this is going to be it for today. We unfortunately don't have a huge update… but what do you have the original demo that you showed us? So that because we have a new generalist that joined us as well as an hrvp that would like to see the original demo or if you can just record a demo and send that over to us, that would be great. But we do have to get just due to the fact that we have others joining us. We have to get their buy in. So that's kind of where we are right now. I know it's and we actually will be able to, once we get that demo, then they'll be able to see the system. We might schedule something else with you just in case they have any questions. I do have one big question for you guys. Is this able to use internationally?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  In which way… just accessing it internationally and sending emails and communicating absolutely. Yeah. Okay. We have a global customer base.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Okay. That is good to know. We do have global workforce and we want to make sure that it's able to use internationally that everyone's able to use it. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  The short answer is absolutely, it does work. Okay? But yeah, I'll get that demo recording over to you from our first meeting. And then if they have any questions or if they want to kind of step through something live in a few scenarios, we're happy to set that up as well. Yeah.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Okay. Yeah. After we get that demo sent to them, yeah… then we'll be able to actually make a decision and actually be… able to see if we're going to move forward or not with you guys. Okay, great.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Out of curiosity, what are you comparing us to?

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Give me one second. Sorry?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  You're good?

KatherineLara-Steely:
  One of them is happyfox and Chelsea will have the other ones. I just have that one up.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Deskpro, and the last one in my notes is.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  I actually did a comparison last night. Thank you.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Happyfox, deskpro, you guys, and then proproofs are the four?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Proproofs interesting. I've never heard of proproofs.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  It's a help desk. We haven't met with them. We're actually meeting with them this week, so I don't know it's a, yeah, a help desk shared inbox ticketing system. So we'll see.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Cool. Well, I have some more learning to do too… well. Yeah, I'll get that over to you. Thank you. I'll wait for, yeah, let us know if it makes sense to set up more time and we'll go from there.

Chelsee Singleton (csingleton@chronicleheritage.com):
  Yeah, we definitely will. Thank you so much for your time today and, yeah, we'll be able to let you know more information after probably Monday. Great. Alrighty. Then, thank you guys. Thanks for hopping on.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. All right, bye.
