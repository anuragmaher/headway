Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hi, Doreen, good morning. Hi. How are you?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Fine. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well, thank you so much for joining.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Sure. I know that Steffi will not be able to join, but maybe our colleague, Anna, I'm not sure though.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let's wait. That's okay. We'll wait for a couple of minutes and if Anna also does not join, then we can anyways, record the meeting and share it with her. Okay, great. I see that your hiver account is already active and you're managing your contact inbox. So basically, Annie yourself and I believe the third colleague, what's the name?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Which name the?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Third colleague between you, Annie, and… how many people are there in your team that we manage? Three people? Three? Yes. Okay. So you're waiting for Annie, And Stephanie, you said is not joining?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. But I think Stephanie is not added to hyver account also.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  As she is, she uses this contact at the rate SL seven that's her.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's her inbox.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  That's her inbox. Actually.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. So, she uses contact at the rate SL seven.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Exactly.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. Now, have you logged in into hiver already? Like, are you using it or do you, I just want to first of all, make sure that the account is set up correctly, and.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  then actually, I only use Gmail. It's connected with my Gmail account.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's right? I'm not.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Sure how it is, if that's the way how it is supposed to be. But yeah, that's how.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm using it, I will take care of it. Don't worry. I will take care of it. I'll explain you how you could use it along with your Gmail itself. Okay? You don't have to change anything for sure. You would simply log in into your Gmail. And from within your Gmail interface, yes, you will have a contact inbox. We're.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  connected and Steffi told us everything comes into the inbox and there we have to put it to our shared inbox or contacts and then we can assign it to either ourselves or?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Someone else. Absolutely. Do you mind sharing your screen? Let's just quickly go over the exact setup and I give you a demo, just a second.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  I have to send Anna the link again so she will join. Hang on a second. I have to find it myself now. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I can share it on zoom. This is the zoom link. Oh, okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me… share my screen. Sure.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Okay.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  You see my screen?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes. And Steffi is also here. So let me let her in.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Oh, no, that's Anna. Probably, she's just in another account.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Hi. Is that Steffi or Anna?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  I'm Anna?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi, nice to meet you.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yeah, nice to meet you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Thank you for joining. So, before you joined in, we just met each other and Doreen was sharing her screen so that I could see the account setup, recommend the best practices and tell you how you use hiver on everyday basis.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, great. So if you see you all would simply login into your individual accounts. Doreen will login into Doreen at the rate Anna, you will login into your Gmail inbox. All you do is simply look at hiver here on the top for your private emails. So, these are your personal inbox. These emails are not shared with anybody in the team. So, if I send an email to Doreen, you would see that email in the top inbox. But at the same time, if there is a client email that is sent to contact at the rate companydomain. Com that's when you have a shared inbox called contact, and you would find those customer service email, the client emails coming into the contact mailbox. So basically, we all login into our Gmail inbox, have extension running for hiver, manage private emails on the top and shared emails for the sub contact at the rate inbox. Right? In one screen. Now, let's take an example. If you open unassigned, this is the email view that has all the recent requests which are not worked upon for an example, can you open this one up? Just my test email for invite. Now, if you look at this email, what is it about? You want to understand what this email is? You go ahead and look at this magic wand. This actually helps you summarize the conversation. So if you click on this, it reads, the email makes your life easier and summarizes it for you. If you click on it, please… yes. So let's say if you have emails which has a long chain, it's a complicated email with you, not been able to read through all of that. You simply summarize it. Hiver gives you a quick summary. Okay?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  May I ask this is now in English? Is it in English? Because English is the only available language? Or because my Gmail account is in English, we can try.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That in your email as well? Can you close this? And can we just simply mark this email closed? Because we don't want to work anything on this email. So you can change the status here and you can mark it closed. Meaning you're done with the ticket. You don't have to do anything. Now, this will actually move out of your unsigned. Now, let's open any of your email account emails. Okay. Let's say this one. Okay. Can you try this? Okay? So basically, it reads it, but it still gives you the prompt in English because that's the native language we support at the moment. Okay?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Sure. No problem.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But it does understand the exact context of your language in the email. Now, if you want to share what this email is about, you can save this as a note and then you can add mention and say, and this is for your reference. Now, do you want just to save it as a note? Just a test? All right. And at the same time, all you do is just add mention. So this is the notes functionality that you want to talk to your colleagues internally. If you want to drop somebody a note. And can you just look at this one or in case you want Annie to work on this one, you go ahead and assign this ticket to Annie as well. So you can go ahead and choose the ownership. Okay? This is the ticket assignment.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yes. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So if you assign it to Annie, can you just do that?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  It.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  actually moves out of an assignment. And in the team section, you would see how many tickets Annie is working on. So at the moment, she has these four tickets open that she's working on. And if you look at Doreen, you have got nine tickets that you need to work on. And this is, I believe Steffi's inbox, right?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So all in all, this is a workload distribution. So if you click on this human button, it tells you which person has, what sort of emails and whoever has the maximum workload distribution.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Now, when you close the team button and you simply look at mine, this is where you have all the emails that you need to work on. Annie. Yes. All right. Now, one thing that I would urgently talk to you about is when you work on any of those emails, it will be essential. It will be helpful to understand what is the category of the email. Is this something to do with a client request? Is this a cancellation? A refund? Like whatever professional service? Is this? This helps us categorize emails like, you know, how we use Gmail labels to label the emails. Yes, you can use all of those in tags in hiver. Now, if you go to the tags button, let me maybe explain that to you a little bit more when you receive so many emails into contact inbox. What are those common emails you everyday work on? Maybe one example, Doreen, you could give me one, Annie could give us, and then we could create those tags and help you categorize those emails.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yeah, it's about arranging an interview.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then we click on plus button and I would say interview, okay. Scheduling an interview, maybe, yeah. And here, you can also give a description to hiver AI, so that next time there is an email coming in for scheduling an interview, hiver automatically understands that email and adds a tag for you without you manually adding it.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, you can give a prompt whenever somebody sends an email for scheduling an interview or you want to write that in French or whatever language, German, Dutch. It should be able to assist you with the setup. So, go ahead and do a prompt to you.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Okay. Can I just say schedule?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Give it your favorite color and let's create. Similarly. What other emails do you receive today? And we can use such tags, cancellation requests… documentation, contracts.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yeah, we receive contracts.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Go ahead into the tags and let's create more.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yeah, like for example?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then, yeah, any recommendation from you Ann?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  We'll have to think about it as a team later on which tags make sense to?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You absolutely, we can close this, go back to the unassigned again, pick up couple of more emails for the test. Let's say this one first email. What is this about now? If we understand the email? So this was an email Steffi sent from Gmail. Okay. So it's a forwarded email.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  It's a forwarded email.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You can just simply go ahead and, you know, summarize, it will save a lot of time and it will, okay.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yeah, because, yeah, because it's two emails actually in one. Now, that's why? Probably, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Can you click again? Just one more time here? Okay? Because it's a forwarded into, you know, merged email. Maybe it's, it could not, but otherwise, when you read the email, you define who needs to work on it or do you have certain emails that needs to go to Anne and certain email needs to go to you? Doreen, like, is there any automation I can help you with?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  No, actually, it's we had Steffi this morning or yesterday evening. She changed the email address in hiver. And that's why all of a sudden all our emails became unassigned. Actually, when I quit work yesterday, we everything was assigned, but we have to start over now. Actually, we're getting along quite well. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. In that case, what you can do is if you go back, I can maybe help you with that. Yeah, you get an option to select emails in one. Go, let's say you want to select couple of emails that you need to work on, so you can select, and of course, you can then change the ownership in one go without opening emails. Yeah. So you can select these emails just as a test example.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  This, no, no, wait, this and this… one, I can just, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then you look at this human button on the top assignment and assign it to yourself. Yes. Similarly, you can also assign it to Anna. If Anna is already working on some emails. Yes. Okay. You can choose the assignment right from there. Similarly. If there are emails that do not need to be worked upon, maybe an example could be, you know, just the fyi, emails, the junk emails. Yeah, this one here. So you can simply go ahead like, can you go back just for a second? Just like that. If you select this email, you also have an option to change the status from here and just mark it close. Okay, if you were to choose couple of emails in one go, you can select it and close it.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Great. Yeah. So what's the difference between closing and deleting? Okay? We.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  don't recommend you delete any of those emails closing, meaning you are done with the response or maybe you don't want to work on it or if it is done, you would find those emails in the closed bucket. So if you click on all views for me, there… is a closed bucket here and you see if you go to the closed, you have all the emails that are done and dusted and you've closed it. But if there is a new response to this email, it would again open up in the mind section. If you are the owner of the ticket, you?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Can.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  always keep the closed bucket also on the top of your screen so that you could see the top closed emails and the pending emails as well. So there is a favorite button, a star button right next to pending and closed. So if you hover around, there is a star button on pending? Yes, similarly star button on closed. Also. Okay. I can keep all of these, you know, shared statuses, right on the main screen. But what, the most important part is the ones which are unassigned, meaning we don't have anybody to work on these emails. We need to first assign it to the team. Then mine is the one where I have been assigned these emails. And then team is how many members are working on what sort of different emails. These are the main three views that you could actually look at because all of these are the open tickets for the team. Okay. All right. Apart from that, do you have any sort of slas? Like you want to work on the emails in no more than two hours? So you have any response time to these emails? Do we, do you want me to help you set that up?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Okay. Yeah. Okay. Let's just.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let's just look at it. You discuss it with Steffi, and then enable it only then. So you click on hybrid settings here, go… to admin panel, please?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Could you go to the shared inboxes… and contacts, inbox… the slas, if you scroll down a bit?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yeah, slas, okay. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let's just create one and we can create it for general SLA, let's say general SLA policy, general SLA, GENE, yeah, general.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. And let's leave it like how long you, what should be the first response to these tickets that you received today? You can put in the first response time here, maybe 24 hours. Like, okay, I mean this is up to you. This is the first response by the way. Yeah.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Just to see how it works. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then resolution is until you close a ticket, how long are you open? Okay? To wait for it? Maybe 48 hours in about two days you want to close it and.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Then.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  you create SLA policy, meaning from now onward, when you receive emails, you would notice if an email is not answered in 24 hours, it will splash a red color logo on top of it, a notification that says this email is delayed so that, you know that now you could move fast on those emails and then you would get a notification for the ones which are already not done in time.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Okay. Now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Under auto assignment, if you look at this one, this basically helps you make sure that the emails, the new emails are assigned in round Robin fashion. Now, this is already turned on by Steffi. I believe so, you know, that new emails are always going to be either assigned to Anne or yourself, Doreen. So there won't be any email in the unassigned. All you need to do is just simply for the time being the emails which are there in the unassigned. We need to clear all of those and move them into the either closed or pending or however we want. We're.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  working on that. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Already. Apart from that, is there any requirement for you to say, hey, thank you for contacting here? Is your ticket number? We are working on your request. Do you need any sort of autoresponder or not?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  I don't think so. No, for the moment.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No. Okay. All right. Very clear. Apart from that, I believe we are all good for now. Now. We can just close this because your use case looks very simple. Let's go ahead and also… ensure that, do you use email templates? Like do you have requirements for all the repetitive emails that you receive today?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yes, we do. But I was talking to Steffi already about it because it's not really templates that will work for us, but we rather we will rather set up a Google sheet, you know, a document where we put certain parts because we have to pick more than one. We have to use more than one template at a time. So actual templates don't really make sense for.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Us. Okay. That is going to be the sheet and basis of it. You would want hiver to help you draft email responses, right? Okay. Now, for that, if you again, go back to the hiver settings, and I can even help you with that later. Whenever you're ready with the team with the sheet, go to the admin page again, hiver. AI, please. Now, if you go to the copilot… yeah. Now, you have knowledge source. If you turn this on, you… have knowledge sources. Now here, you get an option to upload the document with those articles, questions asked and everything. Now, can you click here for me? You see the documents, you upload the files here. Okay? Now that upload can have all the answers, let's say, you know, what is your cancellation policy? Okay? We only cancel in about seven days. What's your refund policy? There is no refund. We can help you with another, you know, interviews or another job landing or whatever, right? Or how much do you charge? So you can have all of those articles, the questions, the knowledge on the documents, and you can upload it here. Now, how it would help you is when you receive email from your customers, candidates in the main screen, can you close this one? And take an example of any email. For that matter? You have option here called copilot. Now, this will help you draft emails on basis of the context of the question your customer is asking. Oh, okay. And you would say help me draft an email. And this draft will actually take context from the documents you are uploading.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yeah, but our customers don't know what they need. We know, we're the only ones.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Then in that case, you can always say, you know, draft response on the basis of pricing policy on the document. Okay? So, yeah. Yeah, or otherwise, yeah.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  That's cool. I understand. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And otherwise, if there are emails which are repetitive, all you do is when you reply to the emails, you simply first.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Of all, save it as a template.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, save it as a template. Yeah, we've done that before. Yeah, we could do that in templates. One thing I would recommend when you're replying to the emails, you don't keep your team in CC, you need not to keep any in CC or, you know, contact inbox in CC because these people are already a part of your inbox, so they know what's happening. They know the responses, they can literally look at it. They have a complete visibility. Yeah, if you keep people in CC, that is going to be cluttering their personal inbox, hiver does not want it. Hiver wants the private emails to be very neat and clear and your contact inbox very neat and clear, two inboxes running in one screen at all. Yeah. So always make sure that's my tip that's my recommendation that you don't keep people in CC when you're replying from within your team, if it is a customer, like if it's a different two email addresses for customer, your candidates, you can choose to do so. All right. Apart from that, if there is any personal email that needs an attention by any, because it was a candidate email for an interview scheduling, but they sent you an email instead of sending an into contact at the rate inbox. Now, how would you deal with that such situation? Is you open any email personally just as a test? Of course… let's say you just open my test email or any test email for that matter?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yeah. Any test email. I.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Believe this has already been assigned to you. Maybe if you look at the email which is, okay, mail delivery failure, let's take this one as an example. If this email was a customer email that was sent to you, but you needed this email to be shared with the team. So that Steffi could also look at it. All you do is just simply add this mail to the shared inbox, click here and add it to contacts. Yes, please archive this email, just get away from this email from your inbox, just archive it on the top. Okay. Yes. And now, if you go to the unassigned in the contacts, you would see that email right here. If you scroll it down, I believe that's a email about the delivery notification failure. Yeah, it's going to be right there somewhere. Okay? It was an old email. You can even search for that email by the way.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yes, all.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. And now that email is a part of your contact inbox, you can simply go ahead, assign the email, talk to that customer representative in your team at mention, drop the notes, comments tag that email and so on. And so forth. Great. Meaning, you can always move your private email into your shared inbox, if that needs to be actioned upon by your team. Okay? All right. While replying, do you use contacts at the rate shared email address or your personal inbox email address?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  I believe it's the personal.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, which is why you notice in your personal inbox, you have so many emails that you have worked on from the contacts inbox as well. Now, if you go into the personal inbox, you would see the same emails that you have worked on from your contact is also copied here, right?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yes, do.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You want to make sure that your private emails remain private and you see any email, right from the contacts, or are you okay with these emails to display here also?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Yes. Yeah, that's okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's okay. Okay. Otherwise, you can always turn on one functionality that will make sure that these contact, shared emails are never copied in your personal inbox. So we can always choose to do so. But if you're fine, we.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  are fine with it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's okay. Lovely. Any questions by far? I mean, I don't want to make it too much for the first meeting, but I want to make sure that you understand it. And then we could take the progress maybe sometime next week. Look at your more questions… for the moment. Yes.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Me too. Great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Are you feeling confident after this meeting that, hey, this is going to be the steps you add, the comments, you note the comments, and then you add different tags. You close the tickets. When you're done with the work. It reopens it in the mind section. Whenever there is a new response, the brand new requests are in unassigned and the team says how many requests have been assigned to people? Any more questions other than that? And we'll be otherwise good to go for the meeting today?

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  I think it's all clear.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Great. If you need any more help, you can always go into hiver settings here and look for our help center, which is a 24 to seven support.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We have our technical team available 24 to seven. Also, I will be the point of contact. I will drop you a thank you note right after this meeting with my calendar and the recording of this conversation. You can go ahead and have a chat with Steffi. Should you need to book another meeting. Feel free to look at my calendar, book another meeting for next week. We'll go ahead and take all your questions. Again. That's.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  great. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Thank you so much for your time, guys. Lovely catching up with you. Thank you. And we'll stay in touch if you have any more questions, like I always say, do not hesitate. Write back to me.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Okay. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Bye bye.

Doreen Bark (doreen.bark@sl7-wagner-professionals.com):
  Bye.
