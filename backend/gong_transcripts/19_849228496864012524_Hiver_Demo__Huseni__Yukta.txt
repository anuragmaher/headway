Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, huseni. How are you?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Hey, hi, ukta. I'm good. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doing well. Thank you for scheduling this session. I'll be helping you with the evaluation. Could you help me understand what made you sort of book this demo today? What exactly are you looking for? So that accordingly, I can help you?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah, basically, like we, I was just testing this tool two days back. I enrolled for the free trial. So I was going through that knowledge base creation and how I can create that internal knowledge base and how it can be used to respond to customers quickly.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, are you only looking to create knowledge base with hiver or something else?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah, we will be using it for the ticketing purpose to manage our emails.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And which email is this for? Like which department? How many people do we have in this? So.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  It's a small team. Like it's basically a customer support. Like I work as a freelancer for one of the sports academy where they sell online courses. So people generally reach out with the queries about cancellation or enrollment or some trouble in accessing the courses, etc.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  So, I just want to create a system where we can respond very quickly to the emails. Like we can feed the system with all our new launches which are coming courses which are there on the platform, so that the tool gets all the information. It should have all the links from where all the sales page links and other things. So it can automatically write draft an email kind of thing. So that's what I was looking for.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And which email do they write on? Like do you have any specific email address?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah. There are two email ids. One is info at the rate lucindagreenxcacademy. Com. Another is membership. This is exclusively for who are the members of?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  The team? Okay. Got it. And how many people are responsible to manage these inboxes today… at?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  The time, I think two people do it. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yourself and one person?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah. During some launch period, like where we get like the tickets volume increase, then we, maybe one more teammate joins it, but generally maximum one or two. Yeah. Got it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cool. I think you can create something like that. So this is the Gmail. As you must have already seen in the tool, it sits on Gmail itself, where you can integrate hiver and create these shared inboxes which are connected to these respective email addresses at all the team members required. And from there, you can actually either use email templates for the standard responses. This is something you can manually do where you can just store all the standard responses that come in and that you keep sending to these, you know, customers. And while you're responding to these emails, you just select the appropriate template and just insert in it. It's good to go. This is something which will still require human intervention or human work. Apart from it. You can use ask AI here wherein again, AI, we do not have something wherein automatically AI learns everything about your company, which it will, but still some sort of human interaction is going to be required for you to be able to sort of prompt AI to either draft a response for you or you can ask any question here. So AI is going to train itself on either you can create the knowledge base within hiver itself that you can put as a knowledge source in AI, or you can put other company resources anywhere that you have stored today. And AI can learn that and then accordingly, where,

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  can I put this knowledge base? So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Basically, you go into the admin panel here and in your respective share inbox, you would have the.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  here in the AI knowledge source. So this is the ask AI. This is where the knowledge source stays. So you can either enable the hiver knowledge base itself or you can just put any external sources, any custom documents that you have. So anything that you would like to put, you can put it here and that's where it'll start training itself on. And then while you're responding to these emails, you can ask AI to draft those responses for you.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  So it will also look at how we are responding based on those replies. It will, if the similar email came then.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It can, yes, it will learn the behavior on what sort of questions come in, how you're responding to these emails and it'll pick on that language and the pattern and accordingly can help you sort of drafting these responses. Great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, you can just directly sort it from here itself and it's good to go. If you need to make any changes, you can do that as well and just hit the reply. And then you come here and change the status to closed. So this is going to help you sort of tracking the progress on each email. So it'll be either assigned to you or your colleague. Likewise, you can distribute these emails between yourselves. And this can be automated as well. You don't have to manually assign emails between the team. You can automatically assign it either through round Robin basis or any specific workflow. If you would like to set up, you can do that as well.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. So there are a couple of emails which does not require our like mostly someone like notification. So how should I get that? Like that should not appear as a ticket.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can just close them. You can put either, you can play with the automation here in the backend, if you have certain email addresses or any keywords within the subject or the body of the email that will help you identify such emails. So you can just auto close them by creating this workflow. So for any emails, and if you can play with the condition, probably certain domains that are, you know, that are there from where you're receiving… these emails, you can put all of those here and.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And you can just trigger an action which will help you sort of updating the status of those which will be marked as closed, so that they will not even come into the inbox. They'll just directly be closed.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  No. Okay. So I've done that. Oh, so the, all the future emails, wherever I've done, this will go, will be directly closed, will not appear here.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So here in the unassigned section, mine and team section, this is where you see all the open emails, right? Pending one goes into this designated section here and the closed ones goes here. So this is where those emails will lie, which will automatically be closed since those are non actionable emails from your site. So you will only be seeing the emails that you're currently working on here and the team section. If you go, you can see for both the people as to how these emails are today. Distributed, how Alex is working on these emails, I can have full visibility there as well. So that if we need to collaborate on any email, we can just easily assign between ourselves or exchange a few notes if required within here itself. So this would be helpful for the collaboration as well. Got.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  It, okay. Templates, knowledge sources, these two are done. So, yeah, if you can also walk me through the knowledge base creation, there was an option I could find.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can just go into the knowledge base here and you can just start creating it from here itself. You can just edit this and just log in.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right now, I don't have access but it's pretty straightforward. You're just logging into it. And then you can just create it as per how you'd like you can also go to help at the rate here in the help center, which lays out the entire workflow of how the knowledge base is set up. So you can just read through this and this will help you sort of understanding the setup here. But it's pretty straightforward. You can either put it for external for public facing or for your internal private usage as well. I'm assuming this is for your customers. Is it?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah. Initially we'll create an internal one and then maybe we can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you can actually have both if you want. You can have one internal and one external as well and you can just set this up, put your branding and all of that. And yeah, it'll be good to go. And then you can put anything there that you would like.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  But how do the like the data needs to be put? Like this will be like some documents, or it takes from our website? Also, it can like it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Will not automatically take anything. Obviously, you'll have to create it from scratch as to how you see the typical knowledge base in the world, right? This is exactly how like we have knowledge base for hiver and how you see the help itself here that I was showing you that's created as a knowledge base, right? So you can just put anything here. You can put different folders. And then under each folder, you can put different articles so that all of this then can help you sort of understand everything about your company cancellation, process, new admissions or anything that you would like. So you can put everything here and you can make it from the UI perspective. You can just design it as per your company, you know, design. So this is how it's going to look like. And then you can just place this anywhere that you want. If you want to place this on your website, for your customers to be able to go into this, you can place that there or you can just use this for your internal employees as well.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay. And I can use my custom domain also.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  OK, clear. That's clear.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  So on the pricing front, there are two, the plans. What are there?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So based on what you need, I'll be recommending the program because this will only have the ask AI, the AI co pilot that we are looking at. And also, okay, the knowledge base are there in the growth plan as well. So that'll be covered. But if you need the AI that I just showed you, which is here that'll help you sort of answering those responses for that, you'll require the pro plan. Otherwise, you can also look at the growth plan.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay. In growth, but it says the AI compose and AI summarizer, is there? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Only, these two will be there, which is basically AI summarizer. Is this which will help you sort of getting the quick summary of the entire email thread. If it's a longer thread, then this is really useful. AI composes just, you know, this little button that helps you sort of connecting your response. So that's it. Okay?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  It will not draft an email for me. No, no, no.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So that's gonna be part of your co pilot here. So if you want drafter reply and all of that, this is gonna be part of the co pilot which is ask AI. So that's gonna be in the pro plan. So ask AI is part of the pro plan. So, yeah, and.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  These are charges per user, we have to pay per.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  User. Yes. So we sell in a bucket of five. So usually minimum requirement is five licenses, but we also do two. So two is the beginning from two. It's five, 10 15, 20 like that. So minimum, at least you would require to buy two licenses if.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  We go ahead with growth. And also, we need to buy two.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. That's across all plans.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Understood. Any major, any other difference between the growth and pro? Like I?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Mean, there are a lot of differences of course, but based on our discussion, I could only see that this is your requirement which will be there in the pro plan.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  And how does it help with the whatsapp and social media thing? Social?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Media, we do not have whatsapp, you can connect here. So this is the whatsapp in case you have a large volume of messages coming in which you would want multiple people to be handling that's, the majority of the use cases that for using high using whatsapp in hybrid here. So you can set it up here itself. If you have a designated business number and you can then receive.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah, we have you, we are using body. So like is there an integration or no?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What do you want to achieve exactly through whatsapp could you tell me that? So?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Generally, during our launches, we'll send whatsapp messages and there will be some people randomly respond replying on that, but we don't have that bandwidth to look at each of those messages when we send out bulk messages. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, this ideally seen whatsapp when you're using a third party tool, and this is across any tool in the market. Usually, it does not allow you to send any messages. So if you're still sending bulk messages, I would not recommend using hypo or using whatsapp within hypo. Because this is strictly for only handling incoming requests or messages from your customers, right? And that's where you want to reply because it's not going to allow you to initiate any new conversation. So, it's like, how you use any customer service or live chat with zomato and all of that, right? The conversation is usually only open for like a specific time period and then it vanishes. So that's how it's going to be, right? You receive any message and then you reply on it and it gets closed for the same person. You cannot initiate a new conversation. Let's say after five days. So, if you are sending bulk email, bulk messages, then I would suggest to not use it here because then if you have whatsapp here in hypo, you would not be able to use it on your phone or the web. Okay. Yeah. Fine.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  So then the email should be our priority. Okay? Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  In terms of the budget, huseni, like what do you think? Have you considered any other platform? What stage are you currently in terms of your evaluation? Yes?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  So, we were using, we are using currently helpdesk, what… do you call that helpdesk app? Helpdesk? Com. Got it. So we are paying around 29 dollars, okay. But we have a single user plan there. There. It's not like we can create tags there and we don't need like user per user. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  They don't offer the AI thing that you are looking for or to draft and all the.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  problem is like, they, their model is like all the emails will forward it to their server and from there, it will not come in our Gmail. So… we like what I was thinking now, gemini is like really advanced where it can see all our emails, etc if it is there in our Gmail.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's true.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  I wanted to leverage that and for that, I wanted a tool which helps us initially at least for the ticketing purpose. And then we can see how it works. But the like the email should remain in the Gmail. So in that case, it's going there. And then it's getting tagged and we have to respond to their tool.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Then it will be difficult now.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  So that's why I can't like because all the sent messages also, I can't have a track like at least those emails which are getting, I can still post them those, but.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. I think gemini is one that you can still keep using when you are in Gmail. And the difference that you will see when you're even you're using copilot as compared to the, gemini can only Polish your emails, right? It cannot feed any new information or let's say fill up for something that's not available already in the email, right? Copilot is going to help you drafting the response exactly from what needs to be responded on this email without having you to prompt or put that information yourself and then asking AI to sort of further Polish your email or elaborate it and all. So that's going to be the key difference for sure in terms of the information that is going to be there already in the draft when you are, you know, prompting it to draft that response for you because AI will then know all about your company, the documents and everything. And based on that, it can then help you with the correct responses automatically.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  But like we have like custom gpts also, which where we have trained the gpts with our business and etc, and I've created similar gems also in gemini. So, if I get all these emails in Gmail, I think if they can read it and then they can apply that logic. It should work. I don't think so.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Then why don't you just use normal Gmail? Why are you even using any tool right now? Since it's just one person?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Because the, sometimes those emails like because we have lots of notification emails. And then there are other like.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Simple filter in Gmail, to sort of either mute those emails or put them in a like a separate label and then mark them as read.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Yeah… but there are some of the team which works on a different time and sometimes they look at those emails.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  We were actually using that reason for like to just streamline those tickets because some of the tickets will forward to them and then they will respond.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And how, what are these teams? How big are they?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  It's like three to four members at max. Yeah, who will be looking at the tickets?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah. I mean, then, yeah, if there are like three, four people and if you're forwarding emails and all, then yes, you can use something like hiver so that you can easily then reassign those tickets to someone else. If someone else needs to pick up, they can just assign it to themselves. So that could help. Okay. I think in terms of, you know, actually implementing a technology like this, how does that look like from you, are you the one who is going to be ultimately sort of going ahead or choosing the tool or there are more people who are going to be involved as well?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  So this decision will be like I'll be taking it forward. So. Okay. So I'll just check with the team and who like basically does all the customer support thing. If he is comfortable, then we can go ahead with this got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It, so you mentioned that you would be starting with two users only as of now, but you also mentioned you need other people to be involved as well. So if you actually implement this, would you be implementing it for two people to begin with or would you be requiring four or five licenses?

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  So initially, we'll go ahead with the two. Okay. And we'll see how it is and got it because we will have more like tickets coming only in March when we launch our membership program. So before that, we don't see at least for a month so we can test it out. And then if we need, we can upgrade it. Got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It. Yeah, makes sense. So let me know while you are on the trial and using it, you can also reach out to the support team as they are available 24 seven. So if you have any question or any concern while you're setting things up, you can just from here, just go to the instant chat support, which will allow you to connect with the technical person and they can help you other than that, you can also use help center to sort of, you know, go through certain technical queries yourself.

Huseni Kapadia (huseni@lucindagreenxcacademy.com):
  Okay, great. Yeah, thanks.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  All right. Thank you. No worries. Thank you for your time. Take care. Bye bye.
