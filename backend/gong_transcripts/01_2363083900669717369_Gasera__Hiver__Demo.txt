Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Irene. How are you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Good. Can you hear me?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. How are you doing? Good. Perfect. Great. Shall we get started or expecting more people to join in as well?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  No, I think it's just me for now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Then. Great. I'll be helping you with the evaluation today. My name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver. I know you did speak with my colleague as well, sharing a bit of your requirement. I'll be building on that. So Irene, if you could just help me understand briefly in terms of what exactly you're trying to achieve, I think that will help me understand that and accordingly give you a brief demonstration of the platform as well.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Okay. So we are a gas analyzer manufacturer and we also, my main responsibilities are service and support and we have a support at casera fi, which is not an email address. It's a group that's shared with every one of us and all the mails that come into the support at casera. Fi. I… would need to like automate that because now I'm responsible for the support in terms that I'll forward… the message to someone in our team, but I don't have any tools to like evaluate where the case is going by. Just, it's only the Gmail and the Gmail ad is itself, is it's not good for that? I can always search and I can start the emails and I can tag them as to do list but, you know, it's starting to I'm at a point that there's so many cases that I would need something automated and also because I'm sending a lot of the same responses. So it would be good, if I could create templates and just send them and not copy paste from somewhere and modify and then send. So it would save me a lot of time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Understood. Yeah, makes sense. So currently, are you the only one who is part of this Google group? So you only receive emails which are being written at support at the rate?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Or, no. Everyone there's 14 of us and everyone gets the mails that come into the support folder?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, this is a very, you know, a common pain point that we keep hearing from our clients wherein especially when you're on Google group, it does not allow you to sort of have that visibility on each other's, workflows and to understand who is handling what. So, it becomes a lot confusing as to, you know, if you need to coordinate on emails and of course, there is no visibility once it goes to anybody's personal inbox, you don't know what's happening there. So that creates some sort of friction as well. Cool. You mentioned email templates. We could cover that as well so that you don't have to send out or copy paste responses for the repetitive sort of emails that you're receiving. Just to confirm Arun, are you the one who is handling this team for support and service? Like after sales support? Okay. Yes, got it. And is this the first time that you're looking out for a tool or have you been exploring?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  We've talked about this like for years, but these five years we've been talking about this and we know there's some kind of there's Zendesk that has a ticket system, but we don't want a ticket system because giving personal support and sometimes the problems aren't technical problems. They might be related to something else. So we don't want them to drown in a ticket system where, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  See. So, we want the messages to come into the support file so that everyone sees them and stays visible. But I need some kind of automation to help with the workflow, and to help like see where the case is going. So, without it being a ticket system because, some case might be open for years. Like there's something happening. I, I'm we don't it doesn't work for us that you would have a ticket and then you would close it. So I've been googling and using chat gpt and that's why I'm here.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. No problem at all. I think see hiver works both ways. It does replace our typical ticketing system that you see like a Zendesk. But you, like you mentioned Zendesk is a like a proper ticketing tool, right? Wherein emails come in, they become ticket and then you close them. While what I understand for, from what you're saying is you're looking more of an email management solution that could help you coordinate and, you know, collaborate better within the team itself. So that is something that I'll focus on as well as I take you through the platform. Let me just share my screen here so that we can get started and we can keep it interactive. If you have any questions in between. If you're curious about anything, just let me know and I can pause in between. Perfect. Great. So just a quick introduction. Irene hiver is a tool that sits right on top of your Gmail. So I understand that you're currently using Gmail, you're on Google workspace. So you will not have to use a separate platform in order to manage this support inbox. You can actually do it while you are working out of your Gmail today. Right now, how it works is you will log in to your Gmail account, like I have done here, which is at the rate. And we will download the Chrome extension of hiver through which we will create the shared mailbox which will be connected to support at the rate email address, right? Like you can see, I have these shared mailboxes here with me which is finance healthcare project support. These are different shared mailbox within my company that I am part of. So you will be creating one with support at the rate. And we will add all 14 individuals who are currently managing this inbox and all emails associated with it, right? So once we create this, you will still be able to manage your primary inbox as you're doing today. And at the same time these emails instead of going into each of your postal inboxes and from there, you doing forwarding or ceasing each other, you will have a singular place from where now you will be managing all such emails, right? So what will happen here from these sections that you can see, this is what will define your day to day workflow so that you have clarity in terms of all the new emails that are being written at support at the rate, they will come into this designated section called unassigned. Which essentially means that these are the brand new emails. Irrespective of if I mark it red or unread, it doesn't it. Doesn't change anything as long as they are here. It means none of us have picked these emails yet they are brand new. Okay, once I click on any email here, you will have this activity panel on the right side. So from here, now, I can give a proper ownership as to who needs to work on this one, right? Without having to decide internally between ourselves. Whoever picked it, just started working on it. Rather, we have some system which says that if I assign this to myself, now, this is with me. I am the one who is going to be working on this email irrespective of for how long it's going to be in open, right? And when you assign email to anyone, this gets recorded as well. So you'll have the logs in the real time for all the changes that we are making as a team. And you will be able to see all the emails that are assigned to you in one place which is going to be the mind section here. So whatever gets to your assigned to you or anybody else, everybody will be able to see all such emails in their mind section. And at the same time to maintain that transparency, all of you can go into the team section. And you can see across all 14 individuals as to how these emails are currently assigned between ourselves. So that we know that if let's say Rakesh has seven open emails that he is working on, I can still go ahead into it. I can see what's happening here. I can get a quick summary as well if I want. If it's a long chain that's been, you know, going on for lots, you know, three, four months. I can still get a quick update on this. I can reassign it if it needs to come to me without having him to forward me or mark me in CC. So do you see how it's becoming much cleaner in terms of collaboration? So this is something that you can do, right? And you can also reassign emails to yourself or anyone. So if somebody is not available, they're out of office on a vacation instead of waiting for them to come back. We can easily just reassign those emails to ourselves? So this would be your assignment bit? Any question? Just taking a pause here? I'm.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  curious. Now I have the hiver extension installed. But do others in my team need to install it also for them to see the support?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Everybody will… have to. But since you will be the admin, so the initial setup is going to be done on your account so that they don't have to go through all those processes, all they have to do is once we invite them, they just have to accept the invite that they will receive in their email. And automatically, it will prompt them to download the Chrome extension. And once that is done, they'll just directly see the support inbox within their Gmail.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Okay, right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Now, in terms of the assignment, we can automate this process as well. So for example, if you have certain kind of emails that needs to be handled by a specific individual, instead of assigning those emails manually to them, we can automate this process. And this is where we will go into the admin panel and… go to our shared mailbox. And from the automations, we can create different workflows for ourselves. One example that I just gave you was of, you know, any email that needs to be handled by a specific person, we can directly sort of, you know, assign those emails to them without having us to routing those emails every time that they come. So let's say, if in the subject, there are certain keywords, let's say abc or whatever right? That helps you routing these emails automatically. We can just put these keywords here and add a step wherein we can trigger this action that this email should get assigned to an individual person whenever it fulfills this condition, or you can assign it among different individuals as well. So if there are let's say three people working on these kind of emails or a specific client. So all emails coming from this domain should get assigned between these three people. So this would be your automation workflow that you could achieve anything that you have in mind as an example that you would like to achieve? Yes.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  I have a, I have an example that we have pulse and laser devices. So one could be that all the emails concerning a o four or o six starting serial number, or the word laser would be assigned to a certain person. If you go lower, there's there was this, that load. Balancing. Does that mean that, it distributes the emails evenly equally. Yeah. But for those three people, okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. And?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  What's the round Robin?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Round Robin is like it'll go in like this way that first email comes to me, second goes to you. Third comes to me like that. Yeah, load balancing is, it's taking this thing in account as well. That Yukta still has 10 emails in her open. So it will automatically, you know, bypass me and give the other email to the other person irrespective of if I am in the queue. So that's the difference between round Robin and load balancing. It'll maintain the load to each individual.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  That's really smart.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, right. And with that, you mentioned you have two types of queries, right? Laser, and you mentioned something else. So for that, you can also use tags here. So tags basically help you categorizing your emails into different buckets. So let's say if you wanna tag such emails which have laser in their keywords in the body or the subject, we can also create that tag here and apply that. So that this gets automatically applied as well along with the assignment here, right? So the tags basically will look something like this on your Gmail, wherein if I go into any email, this is where you'll find the tag option wherein, you can apply multiple tags on email to categorize them into different categories, right? And once you apply, this helps you maintaining a like a repository for yourself. So if I go into tags here, you can easily refer to one kind of emails under that category. So you'll get a clean slate as you start creating those tags and you can have separate tags created for each topic that you're interested in. So that, you know easily refer those kind of emails. So this is something that we could do as well. And from here as we start working on any email iron, you mentioned that you have a lot of repetitive sort of emails that keep coming in, you're responding the same things to them. So for that, there are a couple of things that you could use in hiver. Number one is going to be your email template. So you have an email templates here wherein you can store all templates that you would want your team to use on a day to day basis. And you can categorize them as well into different folders, right? So when you, when anyone is working on any email instead of them typing out the whole response, they can just click on email template and pick the right template that suits here. And then just, it's good to go and they can modify it as well as needed with this. You can also use AI copilot since this is a support use case and you have you're giving support and services after the purchase from the customer. You could definitely use ask AI that hiver has, which works on the knowledge source that you feed into hiver AI. So it becomes your personal AI that helps you drafting a reply. So AI will read this email and will automatically help you giving a reply to this or drafting a response that you could put here or you could, you know, ask any question that you have fed into the knowledge source in the back end, right? So that it then gives you those responses. And you can easily get a help. Or use this as your guide or your buddy while you're working on any email. So this is something that, you could use as well. So in the ask AI to just show you quickly in the back end in the admin panel. This is where you can, you know, upload everything in the ask AI. So this is the knowledge source. So this supports your, if you want to create your knowledge base internally, do you currently have any knowledge base? No right? So you could create this with hiver. It comes with any plan that you would be having. So this is something that you could create and then put in the knowledge source for AI to train itself. You can put any custom documents that you have in regards to your company details and all of that. So that it trains itself on these things and helps you or helps everyone while they're working on any email. So these are two things that you could definitely use to manage, you know, the emails or the inquiries that you get any question on this. Do you think this is something which could be useful? Yes.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Totally.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Just last bit that I would wanna, you know, touch upon before I take your feedback is gonna be the internal collaboration as well here. So while you're working on any emails, so currently we are marking each other in CC forwarding emails or having separate conversations on different platforms rather than doing that. If I let's say, this email is currently assigned to me. I'm working on this. And if I need any assistance or any guidance from my team member, my manager instead of forwarding this email to them, I can firstly save my draft, whatever I have written, if I have written anything. And then I can add mention anyone in this notes section right here. And I can collaborate with my team member without having to ping them separately. If I mention Rakesh here, I put my message here and he will see my note in this through this bell icon or a notification as he clicks on that he will be landing on the same page that I am right now. So he can literally see the entire email chain and understand what's happening, see my message. And we both can converse in regards to this particular ongoing email, right? So it becomes easy for us to collaborate. Multiple people can join and have that internal discussion that needs to be done, on any ongoing email chain. So this is something that you could use as well. And of course, as any ticketing tool would have, we have status of open pending closed. You could always use them whenever you are done with an email. You're not no longer expecting any response, you can just mark them as closed. So that the closed emails will not hinder your mind section. So that the mind will only have your open emails, the emails that you are working on currently, which are still ongoing irrespective of for how long, and all your closed emails will remain in a designated section called closed. And, if you get any response or anything, they will just come back into your mind section. So you don't have to worry about these at all. So this would be the basic workflow iron that I wanted to touch base. Happy to take any questions, feedback. What do you think?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  No, I think it sounds awesome. It sounds like it could really help us because… I'm doing this all manually. Yeah. Right now, and it, it's a lot.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So that is why I wanted to first understand what exactly you're going through and tailor it in a way that it makes sense to you, right? So what are the things that you want to achieve? I think with these functionalities, of course, you can do a lot more. I could go into analytics, help you with the SLA and all of that. But I think for now, even if you achieve this much through hybrid, this will bring a lot of standardization into how you're doing things now and you can always build from there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. As the next step. What do you suggest? Like, do you wanna, would you like to do a trial test this for your team? How it works? Because we do support that as well? Or what do you think?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  I'm mainly concerned because I was asking like our support mail isn't a mail. It's a group. So if I were to, I did download or install the hybrid and if I now want to like invite… to… my team members. So how do you, how do I do that?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Firstly, I would like to understand, do you want to test this for all footing people or do you want to test this with? Let's say two, three people to begin with and see how it works? And then only invite rest of the team. What do you think I?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Think I would will test it but with few people because there's a few of us who mainly do the support. But I do have a, there's a lot of RDRD stuff and a lot more that we can use this for. The main focus is now for support.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So what I will suggest, see we can create the shared inbox with your Google group account that's not a problem. You can start using it. You can invite a couple of colleagues of yours as well. The rest of the people they will continue to use hype, use the use it as they are doing today. The emails will go into their Gmail. Only they don't have to worry about it. It is just gonna be for you and the people that you're gonna invite that instead of you seeing the emails in your inbox that you're seeing today, you will just see those in hybo. So that's the only change that you will see. And then you can manage it. And for the people who are still not aware of hybrid, they can just keep doing the work that they are doing as of now. So nothing will change for them. Okay. Yeah. I have 10 minutes. So if you want, I can help you right now, setting up your shared inbox, and you can invite a couple of folks or do you want to connect again for that? Probably tomorrow or day after?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Maybe I'll start on my own and I'll message if I need help because I think, I… got it like the basics. I'm sure I'll have questions, but now… I think I can start on my own.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. You can do that. The only reason why I was suggesting it to just make sure that you're not facing any issues while you're setting it up so that everything is done in the right manner. And then from there, you could start using it, see how it works for you still, if you want to do it yourself or if you don't have time right now, we can definitely connect. I.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Can also share my screen and you can help me if you have time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can do that. I think it'll just take five minutes. It's not gonna take more than that.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yeah. So just look for them. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  So, I did install. So I have the demo inbox.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, but I haven't.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  done anything else there's? Support? I think I named it asked me to give a name. So I did create a support so that's.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  fine. Can you click on this hiver icon where my red marker is? Yeah. Can you click on the admin panel? Can you click on shared inboxes now on the left?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. From here, can you click on create shared inbox?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Email?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  I think I already created a support inbox.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's fine. Can you just name it a little different from the last name just to make sure we don't come across any issues?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Perfect. Hit next, can you click on the second option, connect a Google group email? Can you put the email address here?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Mine, the,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  support email address? Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect hit next… here. If you wanna invite your team members now, you can put their email addresses or you can do it later as well.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  I'll start with just one.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. That's fine. Even two people are enough that's fine. Okay. Set, click… on. We'll do this later. Perfect. So now we have your support inbox created here that you can see on the left support official. You already have three emails here in this sitting. Perfect. Cool. Now, I didn't from here, you can start using it. Now. I'll just help you with a couple of things here. Can you go back to the admin panel, please? We'll first delete the demo inbox as we don't need that. Since we have already created our real inbox, go to the admin panel, click on shared inboxes on the left… and hover over extreme, right? Click on, delete… perfect. Type, delete demo inbox.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  This shared inbox. For all users?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's fine. It's the demo inbox that we are just click on, just type delete demo inbox in this?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's not typing, I think. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So now delete this for this is done. Cool. Now, can you click on the settings for me? Please on the left? The last option there. Okay. Can you go to features access?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you enable this out of office? So that why I'm asking you to do this is so that you'll have now a human icon here, which would enable you to mark yourself available or away as you can now, see. So currently, it's green which means that your available emails are going to be assigned to you, but when you are not available, you should be marking yourself away so that during that time, somebody else can pick those emails for you. Now, going back to the shared inboxes here. Do you want to set up any automation just to see how it looks? And then you can always change it or tweak it later on?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, before that, let's just create a couple of tags, the laser or the one more that you talked about? Can you just click on this cross for me on top on… the left? Can you go to the Gmail like click on the Gmail on the left? Yeah, yes… perfect. Could you go to tags, scroll up? Yeah. Yes. Here, can you create a couple of tags for yourself that you would like to categorize… your emails on clicking the plus button? Yes.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. You can create one more.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cool. Two for now. So now we'll now go back into the admin panel and into the shared mailbox and create this automation.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Go to the shared inbox.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Go to automations.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Click on create automation. Okay? So this is where we'll create our first automation for, let's say all laser emails. So we can name this automation as well on top where it says automation one, we can rename that and call it laser. Now, this is fine. The trigger is on, is gonna be on all the new emails that you're receiving. We will click on add step and… click on if condition… select condition, click on… add step. Is it gonna be from a specific email address?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  From support?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But it's gonna be, it's gonna be in the subject or the body of the email, right? The keyboard?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  In the email text?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, can you click on from email? Yes. Yeah. Here, can you select body? Not from email? You'll have to select body there. Ah, yeah. So that it's gonna be in, anywhere in the body of the email, if they have, if they have a keyword, okay? Which is laser hit, enter. If you wanna add more keywords, for better accuracy, you can do that as well.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Maybe I'll just leave it for now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. Now, can you scroll down and click on add step? Click on action. Okay? Now select action. Do you wanna also assign these emails to anyone? Yes. Okay. Click on assign to. So for now, since you are the only one part of this, so you can currently just select yourself. Okay? So that all these emails get automatically assigned to you. And with that, click on it on your name, we can add another step wherein… we say action… and we select action and select add tag. Yeah. And we will apply this tag. Perfect. Done. So now this automation is created, so we will be able to use it. Now. We can save and enable this. Perfect. Great. So now you have this automation created Irene. Likewise, you can create more as you start using, okay, for the AI piece. I think… if you click on the AI for me once on… the left, not there, go to shared inboxes only?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yeah.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Something happened.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I don't see. Okay, it's back.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. So, I think let's you know, use this. So you see that warning sign. Can you click on the support inbox there? Not in the admin panel here on the main screen, support official inbox, on your Gmail?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. It currently is syncing your email. Can you click on auto sync later? So that in the backend, it'll just sync your emails in hivo in the backend and you can just keep using it for now. Okay. So I think for now, this is good. And in the email templates, as you can see, you can put your templates as well if you'd like to test as you start using it, hiver, AI is something that we could use as well wherein you can put knowledge source and start testing it, how it's responding to any question that you ask.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do you have any resource right now that you would like to add? Or would you like to add it later?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Maybe later. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So for now, you can test these things as you start using it. And if you would like, I would want to connect again probably towards the end of the week either on Thursday or Friday just as a quick check in for 10, 15 minutes to see if everything is going fine?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yeah. Let's do that?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can we do it on Thursday at the same time? If that's okay?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Yeah. Thursday, two o'clock I've finished time. Yeah, the same time, Thursday? Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Let's do that also Irene, the last thing I wanted to understand, do you want to know about the pricing that we offer or what pricing is, or do you want to put that conversation for later once you've tested it?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  What are the levels? Like I shortly saw some payment plan for something. There was a pro level. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'll just show you.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  What the difference is?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me just share my screen. So these are the different plans that you must have seen on the website that we have.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, the free growth pro and elite, each plan comes with its own set functionalities, right? Based on what all you need, we make a decision or we recommend that what plan will suit you based on the conversation that we have had. I think the growth plan will suffice as you start using the tool because the free plan will allow you to have create one shared mailbox, you can add as many people as you want. But the free plan will not give you the templates, the tags, the automations that we are looking to achieve. So, I think growth plan will have all of those things for you. And if, in case you want the hiver AI as well, which is the AI ask AI that I showed you the tagging, that AI automatically tags your emails, all of this is going to be additional 20 dollars on top of any plan that you choose. So it's going to, then in total cost you 45 dollars per user for per month for like 15 users as we sell in bucket of five. And yeah, we can, then at that point, this is our standard price, but happy to explore based on your budget and what you're looking for once we finalize on the product. Okay? Does it make sense? Any question on this?

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  Not right now. I'll discuss this separately.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then let's connect on Thursday first. Let's see how you feel about the tool. And if you're confident if you think this is something you would like to implement, we can discuss the budget and the price and cost at that point. And yeah, we'll take it there then perfect. Then Arun, thank you so much for your time have.

Irene Pesu (irene.pesu@gasera.fi):
  A great day. Thank you for the help. Thank you. No worries at all.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Thank you. Bye bye bye.
