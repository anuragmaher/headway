Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  hello, is it Lulia? Hello? It's iulia, it's basically like Julia, but without a J.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Iulia amazing. Nice to meet you.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Nice to meet you. I was wondering if you would be surprised that the meeting shows schedule with Nate that's my business. He's the business owner. So that's why the email that I needed for the account has his name. So I'm in charge though.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  I love it. Well, it's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So I see that you've already started a trial with hiver and would love to understand what you're looking to accomplish and how I can help you today myself. I'm one of the account executives been in this help desk space for 11 years, so have a pretty strong understanding of how to set things up and kind of what the limitations may or may not be.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Sounds great. Yeah. And I already have a few questions because I tested a few things and I would like to know how it's going to help me. So basically in the business, we have two email addresses that are basically for the students for the leads and it's hello at selfconcept. Com, support at selfconcept. Com, we are using Google as our hosting. And so far I've been managing these inboxes on my own, but logging in each individual one going forward, I would like to have a team member and I would like this person to manage both inboxes without having to log in because Google has a lot of layers of security and it's just way too complicated to have someone else log in directly into those inboxes. Like I am, I connected. So I started the account with the, hello at selfconcept. Com. And then I connected the support at as another shared inbox. And I've noticed that I still kept going to the regular support at login with Google to handle a few emails and I noticed that they were still not marked as read or solved inside the shared inbox with hiver. So I would like to understand a little better. How does the sync work? And how should I avoid? I don't know, maybe responding to emails on my side. And then a team member doing the same thing for the same, yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, I'm in the back end of the system right now, just looking at your setup. So you have your two, your hello and support at, yeah… what we need to change is the user. So we should use iulia at self concept, not the hello because this is actually a shared mailbox, it'll just, it's not how it's intended to be used. So, I'll help you set that up. And then in terms of setting up you.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Know, having.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Everything work as expected… let me share my other screen. So you, actually, when you go into the other mailboxes, like if you were to authenticate into support at instead of managing it through the shared inbox, you know, down here, you'll… see that the replies have happened on the thread however it won't look like it's read or not.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Because, yeah, exactly. That's what I noticed.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that's intentional. So in hiver, the red ones are only for my user account. If a different user wrote a login, it's not going to show that these have been clicked on. And the way that we like kind of help with this is when we look at kind of emails that are being handled by the team, we'll see like Cole or Alexander. This means that it's assigned to these people. So it's easy to understand like who has ownership of this email right now?

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  So that's why it would be best if I have my own account overall as the admin rather than use one of those shared inboxes as the admin.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  It's interesting. I actually checked with chatgpt before signing up because I wasn't sure which one to go with and chatgpt insisted that I use hello ads to start my account because they were warning me that if I use my personal account, all of my personal emails are going to be shared automatically. And I'm like, no, I don't want that.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. No. So that's so funny, I'll have to let the marketing team know because they're you know, clearly trying to optimize for the new gbts?

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  But how we do this is the hiver setting up here… admin panel. So to start, we're just going to add your personal user as an admin. So, you know, iulia and then we'll come back here and we'll remove the hello app… and then we'll create a shared inbox which I think you've already done for support. Yes. But then each one of these is the shared inboxes that are… you know, anyone with access to hiver in the inbox could see your personal emails will never be shared.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  It makes sense. Yeah.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Cool. So that was the first question.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yes, yes. Another thing. So, I noticed that every once in a while, we do get relevant emails landing into spam and they can be people asking for cancellations. So it's really important that we cancel before the charge happens. I didn't quite see a space where we can check the spam income inside the shared inboxes. Is that a different way to find the spam?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So that's… a good question. So it's going to be the same. The problem. The challenge is it's the same Google spam rules.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Let me get back to you on the best way of doing that.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yeah, I'm not necessarily checking spam extremely regularly, but every once in a while, I remember to just take a look. And so if that's something I have to do from their own inboxes and just check every two weeks, it's not that bad. But I was wondering if somehow I can have the team member take care of it because another thing I really don't like about those spam emails. The moment you click the button, it's not spam from Google. It automatically moves the email. It marks it red and I cannot find it in inbox unless I search for it. So I find a workaround for that, but that's.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  what? Yeah. Well, if you marked it on, if you moved it to the normal inbox in our system, it would then show up as just an unassigned email, but still we'll see what we can do on the spam piece because it's Google's protocol if that makes sense since we just kind of sit on top of it.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yeah, I see. Okay… I've also seen that there is a free plan and there's paid plans. And I'm not quite sure whenever I signed up, I just went to the website and I started the free trial, but I'm not quite sure what I signed up for and what's the difference between each plans. If you can let me know, what are the benefits? What exactly am I trialing right now?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you're trialing, I think essentially, it's like the elite plan, but with some limitations around like AI usage, we haven't really talked about everything that you need, but typically like if you have more than one inbox, so our pricing page has like full information on this.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  The.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  usage limits is kind of the big one. So number one, how many shared email inboxes do you have? And you have two, which would be your growth plan, the number of users that need access to this, it sounds like two. Yeah. So again on the growth plan and then the number of automations per inbox is 10 and the number of like custom attributes is two per inbox. So based on everything you've told me, I think the growth plan would be a great fit.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yeah, this.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Includes our AI composer. So like an AI agent that will write emails for you, an internal knowledge base, the ability to have like collision alerts on multiple people working on the same email. If no one assigned it to themselves… this is a very value rich plan for what we offer. And then going one level above is really about more of like a true ticketing platform of, you know, you want like a service level agreement to automatically like notify people. If we're not responding to emails within, you know, your set timeframe… for larger teams being able to auto assign work based on skills and, you know, workload and then more advanced reporting. Yeah.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  I think that the growth plan is covering all I need. And then if we do grow into more, we'll probably look at other ones. But growth definitely covers what we need regarding that user per month. So in my case, it would be two users, right? Me and my team member?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  And.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  so, because I started the account with helloads, if we make the switch, can we make it in such a way that it's not going to charge me for three users? Because I kind of started it as helloads as the admin.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's no problem. So essentially, we'll just remove that user. So it's like a named user model. So, if I, you know, I don't want to delete anyone, but we can select a user and remove them. Okay?

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  So, basically, what I will do then from the helload account, I have to add myself, add my team member, and then from my regular account, I will go back again to the users and remove the helload as a user.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Okay.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yeah, I will do that. And another thing I've noticed, we have email reminders for our yearly subscriptions and those are sent from gohighlevel. They are sent from, hello at selfconcept. Com. And I've noticed oftentimes when I reply back to them because people reply saying, yes, I do want to cancel, and then I respond back, great. I confirm your cancellation. And then I notice that those emails do not land in their inbox because a few days later, then they insist again, hey, I do want this canceled, please confirm. So a workaround I found for that to make sure that my confirmation arrives in their inbox, I start a separate thread kind of like setting up a new email to the user. Is that possible if a team member has access to the shared inbox, hello ad to start a new email and send it out as hello ad?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yes. So the way this works?

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Oh, nice.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's actually. So we start in the Google protocol. So you and the other user have to set this up where you're going to add the other email alias. So like hello ad and another thing popped out over here. So you just follow that, then you're going to click verify and it's going to say an email with a confirmation link has been sent to support ad.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  So,

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  then I'll go to support ad. We just disconnected this inbox. So we… have my sales and yeah, but you'll get an email here, you'll click authenticate… and then back on the accounts, you can decide, do I want to reply from? Iulia so the same address or sorry, the default address on your Google business account or do you want to reply from the same address that the client wrote into… that's our recommendation?

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  And then.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  we can do a signature so you can have a signature per email alias?

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Oh, yeah. That's nice.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So that's kind of how you set that up?

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Okay. That's that's awesome. I really like it. I haven't played too much with the tagging and assigning just because I didn't add my team member there yet, but, it looks like it works those emojis, the happy faces. Is that like an AI automatically deciding the sentiment of the email? It?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Is, and I think that's actually on a higher plan. I think it's actually, it should be showing up here.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yeah, I don't care that much for that. I feel like it's it starts to get to clutter if I see too many things attached to the same email. So then it likely will disappear once I switch to growth plan.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And if you want to manage that, in the meantime, you just go to the admin panel, hiver AI and then sent up an analysis.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. That sounds good. And so once I make the switch to remove, hello ad as an admin, and then put my own account as an admin. The change of the plan and then putting in the card is going to be on my side of the account. I will be the main admin.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yep. You'll be the main admin. And that'll be in the settings section of this admin panel.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. I think that was it on my end. Everything looks clear. If I have anything else, I can just send an email. But so far, so good, it seems like it solves all the problems I had with managing this.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we're very fortunate we've been in business seven years, and this is a problem that we have solved. Well.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yeah, for sure. I wasn't quite clear where to get started. We did have Zendesk in the past and other platforms and I was like, I just don't want to get something very complex just for this. And hiver really seems to work very well. I feel like having it integrated inside Gmail is really great.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's the whole value prop is like you don't have to change your workflow just makes it easier to see who's owning the conversation. Nothing slips through the cracks. Yeah.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Actually, I do have one more question. So, how does it work on mobile on my phone? I'm logged in every single inbox. And I did notice that because the shared inbox of support is inside, hello ad with hiver. When I get one of those emails, my phone dings me twice.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yes.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  So, and I don't even have hiver installed on my phone because when I open the app, I don't see it. So, can you help me out if it can be used on mobile or what I should set up?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yes. So, hiver has its own mobile app.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Okay. So.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Are you an iPhone or android user iPhone?

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  So, it's going to be this app and all of your support messages will come in here. So, you know, your two inboxes, and then you'll have the same experience of things that are assigned to you, the team, et cetera. So you would then not need to use the Gmail app for these shared inboxes. Yeah.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  And probably that's what I'll do. I'll probably turn off hello ad and support that from the Gmail. So I don't get dings three times for the same thing.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Okay. Yeah.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  That works. And then inside the hiver app, I sign up just with my, I chose the sign in with Google account, and that's how I get through. Yep. Okay. Sounds good. Yeah, there's.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  one last thing. Yeah. So, from the admin settings button, have you seen we have instant chat support?

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Oh, no, I didn't notice that.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we have technical support that's available within one to two minutes any time of day. So, please use this. We're here to help.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Okay. Awesome. Sounds good. That definitely makes it even easier.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's you know, we're in your email, it's important. So.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Thank you so much. Yeah… it looks like your trial is you have a few more days in the trial? I believe.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it looks like you have a trial until February third at midnight or the second at midnight, we'll see how that looks. Yeah. And then if you just put in your credit card, it'll remove the trial banner from your Gmail, if you have any problems like shoot me a note, okay?

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  I will first do the switch of the admins to my personal one. And then I will set the payments through my own account and I'll make that change then.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Sounds like a plan. And if you like the system, you know, in a little bit, you're like, hey, this is working really well for me. You can toggle to an annual plan at any time and it's… paid annually upfront. So, you know, two users 50 times 12 would be 600 dollars, but, you know, it is a pretty decent savings.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I will look into that after we solidify with it cool.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Well, that's everything I wanted to cover on my side, yeah.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  It was all I needed as well. All my questions are answered and I think I'm all set up.

Alex Krumm (alexander.k@grexit.com):
  Great. Well, nice to meet you and we'll talk to you later.

Iulia Cart (iulia@selfconcept.com):
  Nice to meet. You. Have a nice day. Bye bye.
