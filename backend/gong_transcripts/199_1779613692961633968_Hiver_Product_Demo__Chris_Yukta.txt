Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Because it sounds like you have a cold because everywhere I have a really bad throat infection myself, why?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do you have a bad throat? You are not in this gas chamber in Delhi?

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  Yeah, but correct mother in law, literally, both my parents, my sister, my wife, everyone's sick.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):

Jeevan Radhakrishna (jeevan@grexit.com):
  yeah. Yeah. It's the onset of bonsu. It's like we're like reading cancer, dom's last couple of weeks. So, every year, this time everyone falls sick as a result of infection. So, yeah, I have a bad throat.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I hate small dogs.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, Chris. How are you?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Can you hear me?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, I can hear you now. How are you doing?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Well, thanks and yourself?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'm doing well. Thank you so much. Shall we get started with the discussion or expecting more people?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yes, we can get started. No problem.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Then let me just quickly introduce myself, Chris.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  My name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver, as well as your point of contact. I'll be the one helping you with the evaluation of hiver. I know you reached out to us. I think you wanted to reactivate your account or start using it again as you were doing before as well. I would like to understand more in terms of what changed from the last time that you were using it in what capacity you would like to use it and what all you would like to sort of solve. And accordingly, I'll be in a position to assist you.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  So we have been. So we're a very small team, a small business that we've… been trying to find the best route to success in terms of managing… or organizing our emails and communications from customers and sellers because we're a marketplace and we operate on very small margins and basically the costs of all these different subscriptions that are having it become like overwhelming. So we've been trying to find other avenues where we are basically collating all of these different channels into one place. And we've used hiver for a couple of years, I think since… very early days when it was launched and we decided that I actually had other staff here that wanted to use another system which was trengo to integrate whatsapp and all the different channels and whatever. And I was out of the business for two months in that period and I let them do it and I'm not happy with the results of it. I think it's a… good tool but it's not good at something, you know, like it's a little bit good at everything and not really good at something. And to be honest, I preferred the sort of the workflow of either, we never integrated whatsapp to it. We haven't tested any of that yet. We haven't integrated Shopify with it because I think that the integration wasn't ready for Shopify at some stage. I don't know if it is now… but there's basically two people excluding myself. So three in total that need accounts. And I'm just looking to automate as much of our communication… with either sellers or customers in our marketplace as possible. And I just found that hiver was a better solution because I had more trust in it. I could see, I could see like history of emails like the tagging was easier than what I've seen by using tringo and yeah, I feel I just want to revert back to a, what we had and I understand that might not be possible. I did download data and whatever from it before I left, but yeah, I just kind of want to put that back into place. And then I also want to explore further into hiver especially with whatsapp… as well because I never got to see that and I don't know how it works and all of that. But we're really struggling with our whatsapp stuff. At the moment. I see whatsapp's actually, you're… not able to access it through your meta inbox, but for some reason, South Africa is excluded from the list that's right now. So yeah, I kind of just want to, I want to revert back to what we had and then I wanted to talk what the best case scenario on pricing for us would be?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. Yeah, I could help you with that for sure. Could you help me understand which like what email address you're looking to sort of manage within the team? Is it for support or on some other team?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  So we run obviously… Google workspace. We have three accounts. Well, there would always be three users. And then we've got group emails. So support at story info at story, email, and then consignment at story ktown, so those are all different like tags I think are.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  These different mailboxes, are these different shared mailboxes that you would like to create?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yeah, they're shared mailboxes, but they're set up as groups in Google workspace.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's fine. And we are looking at in total three people, right? Who will be accessing these?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And apart from email, you said you're also looking at whatsapp right? Yes.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  I would like to explore integrating whatsapp into it as well. The problem we've had with like tringo, for example, it doesn't allow us to communicate easily with people on whatsapp, there's a whole bunch of like API limitations like if we miss something over a 24 hour period, then we can't respond to all of that stuff. So we've kind of just preferred just using it on a phone rather. So I don't know what the setup in hiver is, but it is something I wanted to explore.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So I think that will remain the same with hiver as well. The 24 hour window when you connect whatsapp with hiver. And these are the settings which are there from the meta from meta itself. Yeah. And I think third party platform can sort of tweak those because these are set for the privacy concerns. Because when you're creating whatsapp within hiver or the other platform that you're using, I think these are used mainly to manage your incoming traffic of messages which is not being able to manage just by one person. And that's where you create whatsapp in hiver connected and be able to receive all the email, all the messages. But yes, there are certain limitations in that and these are like you cannot use whatsapp anywhere else. So you always have to be on hiver, have your Gmail, and then sort of be able to use it. And then you cannot initiate any chat from your side. So you cannot. Yeah. So that is going to be there as well. So it's just going to be restricted to you managing only the incoming messages. And then of course, you have to reply to those within a certain timeline. Otherwise they'll just vanish. So these are going to remain.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  In that case, we'll leave whatsapp off for now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because it won't fulfill the purpose that you're looking for. Yeah, just wanted to let you know about that. Cool. Then Chris, I think since you have already seen the platform as you were using it for up till very recently, things remain the same in terms of handling your inbox for three users, we will just create the three inboxes and have everyone be part of it. So that for you to be able to manage these things in terms of the Shopify integration that you mentioned, we do have that so you can easily connect to your Shopify and this is where it will look where you can then fetch details, the order details while you're working on it. So that is something which is possible. Anything else that you would want me to sort of show you which you have not seen or you're interested in?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  I see you guys have been doing a lot of work in AI stuff. Yeah. Where does that come in here?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So in AI, like there are different things that you can do, right? We have AI sentiment analysis that gives a sentiment to your email so that you can prioritize them accordingly. We have AI co pilot as well, which helps you sort of asking AI any questions which helps you being more productive or bring efficiency while you're working on any email. It also helps you drafting a reply for you based on what's written in the email. So these are things which you can definitely use as you start using hiver, also with the tags, like if you're using tags to categorize your emails. So instead of manually putting these tags, AI sort of trains itself and learns the behavior on what kind of emails you're you know, putting the tag as billing and it sort of automatically starts applying those tags for you.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Lovely.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, these are the couple of things that it helps you with. So yeah, would you want to have AI as well added within your tool?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  I think… so. Yes, I like the… co pilot.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'm.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  just wondering like because the draft reply, if we get that natively in Google already?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, you don't I think it helps you polishing your emails, but it doesn't draft a reply for you within Google. Okay? Yeah.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yeah. I like it that there's a lot of my staff sometimes battle with, you know, sort of correct kind of tone and things like that when it comes to emails, and I mitigated that by creating templates for them to insert for a lot of sort of repetitive things. So, is it a separate cost? The AI thing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it is. So in terms of the pricing, these are the plans that we have based on what all you're looking for. I think the growth plan will suffice. It gives you three mailboxes. Let me just check if it has Shopify integration as well. We do have that so that's perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  AI is not going to be included in that. So for AI, if you want to use that as well, it comes with an additional cost of 20 dollars per user per month. So right now, if the plan is about like 25 dollars, it's going to cost you then 45 dollars… I know that you are also looking within certain budget. Would you mind sharing that so that I can help you accordingly?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  So, we were on the pro plan?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yes.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  That was costing us 95 dollars, 50.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Eight cents a month.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  For three users? Yeah. And with the, with that pro account, is that including the AI or?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no. In each plan, AI, is each plan is?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Separate?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's a separate cost.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, are you looking within like 30 dollars like the same price that you had for pro?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yeah, I wouldn't want to spend more than 100 dollars a month?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got. It. Makes sense. So, 100 dollars is about like 30 dollars per user per month, 33.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Point three probably.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, like exactly. Got it. Cool. Let me see what, and how soon do you want to start? Are you like ready to sort of start using it or is there any timeline? Yeah, I.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  would start immediately.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it understood. Okay. And AI is something that you would want to have as well, right? Included?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Ideally, yes… I don't know that I'm probably asking for a lot, but.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  that's fine. So, what we can do is this growth plus AI is going to be 45 dollars. I can pitch like I can request for like a 25 percent off on this. Usually we can stretch till 20 percent, but since you are past user of hiver as well. So I can try for 25 and that'll cost you about like 33 dollars for each user and it'll be like near to your budget that you share, which is like 100 dollars, will that work for you?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yeah, that would probably work. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because usually we do not discount on our starter plan, right? That's why you were on the pro plan and you had the discount, but since you also want AI, then if we look at the pro plan, it's going to just cost you a lot of money. So I will try to get the discount on the growth plan so that it comes within your budget and you could have both things to sort of, you know, enable it in your account.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, should I do this, Chris? Like are you the one who's going to be going ahead with the, you know, payment and everything? Should I ask the finance team to share it with you?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yes, please.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Then let me do that. And once we do that, you can set up your account if you want.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I can connect with you one more time to help you with the setup, then you can get started. Yeah, do you want to connect? Let's say tomorrow or day after for our onboarding?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yeah, tomorrow would be good.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Tomorrow, what time should we connect?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  We could do same time or is this your earliest slot? I don't know what time it is for you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, no. I can connect earlier than this as well if you want.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Say again.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I can connect earlier than this time as well or at the same time also?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yeah. The earlier, the better… what.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  time, do you think? What time is it for you? You are in Africa, right?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  South Africa? Yeah, South Africa. So it's currently almost three o'clock here now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you want to connect? Probably at 12?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Yeah, that would be great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's currently three P. M there, right? Three.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let's connect at 12. I will share the invite with you and then I will help you with the setup so that you don't face any issues, and then you can start using the tool and I'll get the payment done in the meantime.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay. Great stuff. Thank you so much.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. No worries. Chris. Anything else I could help you with?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  And that is all for now. So we have just one point. While I will be taking three accounts… the third account is a new employee that still needs to start and she will only start likely later this week or the following week.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  So we'll see what happens. Well, I guess I'm happy to pay for it so long. I just don't know. I won't be able to set up the third account just yet.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's fine. Whenever you want to upgrade to or add additional user, you can always do it within your account itself and it's going to cost you on an appropriate basis. Like that same discount is going to be applied for that user as well.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And just to confirm we are going with the annual plan, right? Because I showed you the annual pricing.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  It will be monthly.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, is it okay, monthly? Can we do annual? Because usually the discounts are possible on annual, and also the price that I showed you is for annual. So the 25 dollars is annual monthly, it's going to be 35 dollars. I can get a same discount here, but it's just going to cost you more.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Just see if you can check with your finance just like even, if they just reinstate what I was currently on because I was on monthly, I look at my invoices.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, that's fine. Monthly monthly is still possible. It's just going to be a little, you know, it's… just going to cost you more. So with monthly, it's going to come around 120 dollars per month.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay. Yeah, I'll just see what they can do if they can just see my like previous invoices. So I had a pro plan. The unit price was 59 dollars, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You put on the pro plan?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  46 percent discount?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, at 95 dollars. But in that, the AI was not included, right? And also the pro plan earlier was priced at 49 dollars per user per month for monthly. So the prices have changed and also we are.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Including, yeah, that one's actually coming down on the pro plan.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And actually, it has come down, yeah, exactly.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay. Well, they can just let me know what like the best case scenario is… yeah… and then we can just take it from there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you stretch till 120 dollars? Is it possible or no?

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  I'm just… doing the conversion here.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Because to be honest, there is nothing that, I would have to do after this call. So, if you could share, I can help you, right? Because to go to like 33 dollars that's like 40 percent discounted, that's just not going to be allowed internally from the team if you can. If you don't want AI, then of course, we could look at, you know, and that will accommodate the pricing. It'll cost within 78 dollars for three users at 25 percent. But if you want AI as well, it's going to be.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  So, yeah, I would say, okay, one, three dollars, 2,075 grand. Yeah, I can go to 120. I think that's an absolute max. It's depending on the exchange rates keeps me around 2000 dollars, which is what I'm currently 2000 grand, which is what I'm currently spending.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So 120 dollars you're saying, which is about 32. Okay, cool. Then, that's fine. I think 20 dollars, 120 is fine. Although the 25 percent is 123, but that's fine. We can do 120. Let me just get it, you know, shared with you the invoice. And then we can connect tomorrow.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Okay, cool. Sounds great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Then Chris, thank you so much. Let me know if you have it. Thank you very much. No worries. Take care.

Chris Howard (chris@story.capetown):
  Bye. Cheers, bye.
