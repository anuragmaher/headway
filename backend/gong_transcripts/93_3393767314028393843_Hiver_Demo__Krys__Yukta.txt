Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, how are you? I'm good… awesome. Shall we get started with the discussion?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Yes. Can I, do, I pronounce the name as Yukta?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, it is Yukta. Great. Perfect. Krystalle. Thank you for scheduling this meeting with us. I'll be helping you with the evaluation. So before we get started, just wanted to understand what made you look out for hiver. What exactly are you looking for? So that accordingly, I can help you.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Yeah. So maybe I can give a bit of a background to my organization. We are actually a film festival that happens annually over 10 days around 10 days. So we usually have a core team of six full time staff that increases to about 30 plus with like project and contract staff coming in closer to the festival period. And we mainly rely on Google apps like Gmail, Google sheets slack as well as we have our own CMS and website. So I think what we are lacking in terms of the organization is some kind of like customer support solution where inquiries are coming in via different channels such as multiple email accounts… as well as social media.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So it's.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  hard to kind of like track the customer's journey or assign them to the right person. So maybe it may create certain like inconsistencies when we are responding to the customers, but I'm also curious to know like what else hiver can do also.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So in terms of your channels and where you're receiving these queries from your customers, what are the channels that you usually use? Are these email, slack, social media… yes?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Email and social media? And then we use slack for internal communication?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you would want to centralize for all the emails that are coming in as well as any query inquiries that are coming on the social media. Is that right? Yes. Got it. And for the email, do you have any central email on which you receive these customer emails? Or are these multiple emails that customers can write on?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Multiple emails, and also because we have different types of customers. So sometimes the inquiries from different customers can overlap like maybe they are asking like we have donors as well. So maybe the donors are asking ticketing questions, but there is a separate ticketing email address that handles ticketing inquiries. So I think what happens is that a lot of time is spent sort of like, okay, then the person handing the donors has to check regarding the ticketing inquiry, and then they come back to respond to the customer. You know what I mean? Like.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So you have different email addresses catering to different function within your organization? Yes, and accordingly distribute those emails internally. How many of such emails would you have today, at which you receive these emails?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  How many of such emails? I… think the generally… like day to day there isn't a lot, but it's kind of like during the crunch time. So maybe like two months before the festival, two to three months before the festival. And then the email rate kind of like steadily increases. I don't have the exact data on the number of emails that we receive, not.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Those emails I'm talking about, I'm asking for the email addresses within the company, how many of such generic email addresses you have on which customers are writing on a day to day basis? So, let.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  me, think about three to four. Okay. Three to five. Let's put it as that three?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  To five. Could you just say or tell me a few of these? Okay?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Sure. So we have like the ticketing email… ticketing at sgif. Com, for example. And then we have like inquiries at sgif. Com.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Cool. We also have friends at sgif. Com, which is for donors. Sometimes we get inquiries via like marketing at sgif. Com also.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. And like these three to five email addresses that you have just mentioned how many people are responsible to answer to these emails internally?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  So, and I'm not including social media yet. So that's another channel as well. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I would first, I wanted to understand the email part and just to let you know, since we're already discussing currently, we do not support social media.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Oh, okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So with hayur, if you're evaluating it would only be for your email that you could manage by creating shared inboxes, connecting with these email addresses. Okay? That we just discussed like ticketing, we can create one shared mailbox, add all the relevant people or the users who are going to be managing this inbox on a day to day basis. And likewise, we can create multiple of these, and you can have same person be part of a different inbox as well. So that in case someone needs to do overlapping? And if someone is handling, you know, both the inbox together, they can do that as well.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Okay. But I.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  would like to understand, do you want some, a tool which also centralize your social media and email in one place itself? Is it a must have for you?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Or is it okay to do the email? I mean, it would be helpful, but I guess that… can also be optional because I think the social media inquiries.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  I, it's kind of like handled by a different team. I would say, so to answer your earlier question, how many people are handling the email addresses? It's one person each?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  One person each. So there would be like three to five people in total. Also, I'm assuming that these people would not have their individual accounts, do they?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  That's their individual account?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  They have their individual accounts as well.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Those are their individual accounts.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So these are the individual accounts, like ticketing at the rate is assigned to a specific person, likewise, the others as well. So I'm just curious like when you already have one person assigned to each of these accounts then, is there a reason why you're looking to centralize this? What part of it, do you want to centralize here?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  So, I think the centralizing part comes from the fact that we have inquiries that overlap.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So… it,

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  would be like for example, maybe friends at sgif receives a question that's more for ticketing. And during the crunch time, friends at sgif can maybe like receive a lot of emails in one day. So it may be more efficient for them to kind of like redirect to the right person while they focus on other queries that only they can tackle. Does it make sense?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. But in that case, also, I think Chris, you would still have to do that manually, right? If I'm playing let's say ticketing at the rate email address or account. I'm working on it on a day to day basis. I receive an email which is more towards let's say inquiries. I'll have to still select that email, forward that email to inquiries so that they can take care of it. Since inquiries is also handled by one person itself. So I do not suggest for this reason to use a solution because even if you use a solution, I mean still you'll have to manually do this, you know, one person forwarding emails rather. I was thinking a ticketing solution or a solution like hiver is mostly used when you have multiple people who are responsible to manage a single inbox. For example, if you have had let's say five people who are managing ticketing at the rate inbox, you know, together, right? In that case, the problems arise of who is handling, what, who is answering to which email? How do we better collaborate on these emails which are coming to this inbox? But since you have one person already assigned to each, I do not feel that there would be a need to then have a tool to sort of now manage these emails. And that any tool in the market will not solve this problem of redirecting the emails automatically. You can rather use Gmail filters which wherein you can put something like if an email comes in, you can put the keywords like it's related to ticketing and if it comes to, it should get forwarded to ticketing automatically. So I think Gmail filter can do that for you.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Okay. So you are saying that hiver is meant more for if multiple departments need to handle a single inbox, exactly? Do you mean that?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Multiple people? Yes. Okay. So we.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  have another problem that is maybe less directly customer centric. But for example, we need to invite guests for events… for example, for our gala, red carpet events, etc. So this invite list and RSVPS are handled by multiple departments… and there is a lot of like internal miscommunication because there are overlaps or like two departments are inviting the same person and that person, the guest is like RSVP to both, for example. So it creates… a lot of repeat… communication or I think miscommunication as well. So I think that's also a problem that we are trying to solve in some ways. Yeah. Now.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is an outbound thing, right? You are sending out the invite with multiple people. Let's say, I'm part of one department. I know someone that I want to invite you from another department, but you also know that same person and we both are sending invites from our ends, right? So how can we eliminate this? Are you using any outreach tool within your organization? No?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  I think currently, it's very manual in the sense that we have this like master Google sheet of names, and within this master Google sheet, there are already sometimes like overlaps.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, and then different.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Departments handle different sections of the master list and then they email it to them manually. Got it. Yeah. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  There are about it, right? Again, it wouldn't be the right fit for hiver, but I can still make a few suggestions either within the Google sheet. You have one column wherein a person, you know, fills that if they know that person that they want to invite, and if it's already invited, they should first check the sheet before sending the invitation or if the,

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  If that's not happening, then you create, you use some outreach tool which helps you sort of sending the bulk invites. So what you can do is first you maintain a Google sheet, you ask everyone in the company, whoever they want to invite. They give you that Google sheet. Nobody sends the invitation by themselves rather use a tool or you don't even have to use a tool for that. You can just only one person can just sort of send the bulk invite to everyone, but it can also happen within Gmail itself. Okay?

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Sorry, give me a moment, no worries.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Sorry, I'm back because someone else wanted to use the meeting room. But anyway, yes, yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, I think for this also, you can just use or organize this internally by not have letting people to send invites by themselves, rather have one person to send the bulk invites once everybody has sort of, you know, filled that sheet with who they want to, you know, invite.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  I see. Okay. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That solves this problem.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Okay. So in that case, it seems like it's not really suitable for us then?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, not really. But yeah, if anything comes up, if you have anything in terms of multiple people handling a shared email address, shared inbox. And if that's the use case that you come up with either for internal or customer facing, I think at that point, we can connect and I can then help you with the evaluation.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Okay. I appreciate the honesty on your part.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. I appreciate your time and let me know if anything comes up in the future.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Okay. Thank you so much. Thank.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You so much. Take care. Bye bye.

Krys (krystalle@sgiff.com):
  Bye.
