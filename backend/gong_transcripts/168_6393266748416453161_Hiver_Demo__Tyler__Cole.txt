Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on Tyler?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Hi, Cole. Nice to meet you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice to meet you too. Where are you calling out today?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  I am based outside of Philadelphia.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, nice. Very cool.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  How about yourself?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm based out of Brooklyn New York.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay. Nice.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But I appreciate you hopping on the call here though. Tyler would love to just set a quick agenda and start with a quick round of introductions, then we can jump into a product demo and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions and next steps, but I can kick us off for the intros real quick.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  My name's Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the email management and client experience space for a little over seven years now helping similar companies manage internal external communications across multiple different channels. But yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can help y'all tonight.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Yeah, yeah. So on my side, I'm Tyler camps, I am the head of our investor services and credit operations groups at Hamilton Lane. I've been at Hamilton Lane for coming up, I guess in a couple of months here for 15 years, my teams are largely focused on supporting the fund products that we have in the market and then supporting the investor base post, getting them in our funds, right? And so that's through an internal investor portal that we have, but also via email as a large channel of communication, right? As you probably have seen from others. But yeah, so we've traditionally used outlook inboxes to kind of centralize this stuff. But outlook inboxes inherently are not very good at collaboration. And so we've tried some other band aid solutions and I think now we're just trying to figure out what's the best solution for us rather than working through band aids.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So you're using outlook today from the email management standpoint?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  So, I guess the band aid that I said for our largest inbox, we are using Jira as a tool to just try to centralize and have some capabilities to collaborate. It's still, it's not great, right? Because it's really more of like an internal only tool where we can't actually leverage it to like write an email back to somebody we have to like, you know, download and then open it up in outlook and then send it back via email. And so it's just, it's not great. I mean, it's a lot better than where we were before, where we were tagging things in outlook, right? You know, like somebody's working on this one versus someone's hasn't looked at this one, but still, it's just not ideal.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And how many people today are managing like living at a Jira, working through these email communications on the team?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Yeah. So, the team that's focused on that is around, 15. I'd say there's probably like three power users that are kind of managing the workflow process, right? So, an email comes in and that triggers an event, that needs to then get sent out to someone else on the team to action. Or if not, if it doesn't need to be, you know, one of those three users would do that. But, yeah, I'd say 15 in total.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And is it the inquiries at hamiltonlane? Com, email, is that the primary one the team's managing?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  No, this is going to be, investor relations at hamiltonlane. Com.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. And I saw on the website, you have a quite a handful of different other distribution lists, shared mailboxes? Is there primarily just this one that you're looking to manage? Or is there others that you'd be looking to expand out into?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Yeah, I mean, I, I'm selfishly looking for a solution for myself, right? And my team, but, you know, by no means does that need to stop with me, you know, I think I'm just trying to see what's out there in the kind of initial round, we'll probably definitely loop in some others as we continue to, you know, have discussions and maybe demos or whatever it is. Just to get a better sense.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. That makes sense. So I can jump into the, product demonstration here, Tyler to show you how we're helping, teams manage, email communications effectively and efficiently and, feel free to stop and ask any questions as we're going through it here.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  All right. Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So taking a look at my screen here, you know, what's nice about hiver is we built a platform for outlook clients to one manage their personal email communications. And then below the shared inboxes that you have as an organization. So you're going to log into this environment with your Microsoft sso, you know, you don't need another login or password. We have that read and write integration with Microsoft, and then going to the left hand side to the support share mailbox, right? So this is where we're going to manage the inbox intake itself. So as I click into the support share mailbox, it opens sub views beneath it that helps us manage those communications. So the first is the mind view everything that's been assigned to me that I'm owning on and need to work through. The next is the unassigned section, new emails that have hit that mailbox that need to be distributed out amongst your team. And then the next is the team view. So this is, you know, where you can see Tyler what everyone on the team is working on in real time, what's outstanding and what needs to be completed across the group.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Got it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, and I can easily click into people's emails, see what they've said, you know, everyone has visibility into everyone's responses. So it's very easy to pick up with others left off as well as bring people into the conversation for collaborative purposes.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  That's great. Yeah. I mean, that's a big problem that we have right now, right? Is, you know, even though we have Jira, all of the email, actual communication that's occurring is happening outside of Jira, so, you know, we, if somebody's out and they were in a month long conversation with somebody, if I wasn't copied on it, I can't get to it, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Yeah. And that's something like, you know, we saw for a lot of teams just giving you clear visibility into everyone's conversation. So if you just need to hop in and see what's going on, just very easy for that perspective. Yeah, but go into the unassigned, right? So I'll click into this email. So we built this to be very similar to an email client similar to outlook in that fashion. So taking a look on the right hand side, you'll see a couple of different actions we can take around the email. So the first is assigning it. So in this case, I'll assign it to myself. Let the team know I'm going to follow up and own this communication. The next way we can assign work is a round Robin automation. So we can equally distribute emails as they hit the mailbox, ensuring fair workload distribution is happening. And then the last way we can assign work is skill based routing. So maybe, you know, someone handles a certain client, we can identify that client's domain and make sure it always gets routed to that specific person to own that follow up or communication. Just curious like how ideally would you want that set up today? Would it be like a skill based approach like round Robin? Like how would you ideally want like the routing to work?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Yeah. So you kind of mentioned, you know, based on a client, right? We have based… on like the request that comes in typically is related to a specific fund that we have. And so with that, I have a person on my team or two people on my team that are assigned to that fund. And so like the person that's assigning at the initial stages would then assign that person to it to handle it from that point forward. So I think if that's possible, then I think that probably makes sense. But even like the round Robin approach wouldn't be a bad one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then on the right hand side also, Tyler, we have some other actions like tracking the status, whether it's open pending or closed like that ticketing functionality to ensure nothing slips between the cracks and that we're working through things to a resolution… adding those tags for organizational purposes. So we can use these tags to create buckets folders or views to help manage conversation types. We can also report on these tags on the backend to understand, you know, why are people reaching out to the investor relations inbox over a certain time period? What are the hot requests we're seeing from clients over any given date? And then we have custom fields. So further ways to slice and dice these conversations. So we can create dropdown fields… we can create, you know, just text box fields, value fields and then date range fields to further, you know, bring in data on these conversations.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then right below is the collaborative aspect. So being able to collaborate internally… I'm going to send this notification to matt. He'll receive that right over here. On the left. Once he clicks on that notification, it'll take him to this thread where we can kind of keep having that back and forth conversation. Maybe he'll use like our AI summarizer to get up to speed on the conversation really quickly if it's like a 50 email thread. But let's say we need more information. You know, we want to respond to this client. We do have the ability to populate AI messages using our copilot. So our AI copilot can search through PDFS word docs information to help your team draft replies. So if you have any internal documentation that might help your team more effectively and efficiently respond, this is where we can use the copilot to help them do their job better. And then now, I'm going to choose the third prompt which is offer account activation assistance and propose a setup call.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then I can insert this into the draft right here for further editing. Maybe I'll create like a shared draft for someone else to come in and further edit that conversation?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay. And what is that AI running off of? Is there like a library that you have to maintain?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it can pull in from like our knowledge base. So we have an internal external knowledge base where you can add information. So it can pull from that. And then it can also pull from like PDFS that you're feeding it word docs and things along those lines.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay. And what, I guess, what is that running on open?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  AI, it's open AI.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay. All right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So that's where we can kind of use that. Then we also have email templates. So kind of like those canned responses. If you want to quickly populate a message, we can also insert customer satisfaction if you want to see how the clients are feeling after it, so on and so forth. And then once you've deemed the conversation done, you know, we've worked it all the way through to the end, you can send and close the conversation, changing the status from open to close and you move on to that next email communication.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay. And so just like at the top there, I see that it has a from, is there the ability to, you know, it's coming into investor relations, but I want to change it to my email address to send out?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. 100 percent. So if you want to have that personal touch, you can either choose whether it's being sent back from the investor relations or it can be sent from, you know, your email itself with your signature or whatever it might be.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But just want to pause here, Tyler, what are your thoughts on this so far?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  No, I mean, this looks great. I mean… I think this solves a lot of the friction points that we have. You know, where the solution we have today is two separate tools that don't really communicate right completely. And this kind of lumps it all together into one… with, I think the ability of like the AI piece here of trying to create a standardized way of responding as well. I guess from that standpoint, is there like over time, does this kind of build into a repository… of kind of canned responses that, you know, it'll see the same requests coming in and we know the answers type of thing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, can you repeat that one more time? Tyler?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Yeah. So like, you know, if, does… this have the ability to look at past… responses to questions? Does that make sense? So like if, you know, we're getting a question of how do I reset my password, right? And so if we respond to that, once we start using hiver, the next time that pops up, will it look back at a previous email that was drafted to answer a question?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it can learn, the copilot can learn from previously drafted responses. We can also create an automation for those standardized questions like password reset. You know, we could do things where it's like new conversation comes in. We've identified in the body of text that, you know, this is a password reset request through, you know, whatever keywords, key phrases. However we want to find it, let's send an automated email reply, giving the exact instructions on how to reset your password.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay. That's great. Yeah, that's good to know about the kind of learning ability because once we get one question from an investor, it's you know, if it's something that's like thematic about the market, oftentimes, we get the same question multiple times. And so we're having the ability to respond once and then have that kind of learn that this question's going to come. Again. We can use this as a canned response. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. 100 percent. And then in terms of like analytics, is there anything that you'd be looking for specifically from an analytical background? Yeah?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Not so much. You know, I mean, like right now, my analytics are like Jira based. So it's really just how many requests came in, how many requests were solved? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  timeliness. So that's really the… gist of it right now, but, you know, we'd love to see what hiver offers from that standpoint. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, let's say we want to take a look at like the last 90 days of data. We're taking a look at the support mailbox here. So here's where we can see active new resolve conversations over that time period, our performance metrics, like average first response time, what was our average resolution time as a group? Individual metrics? Like emails assigned per user, email sent out per user. So understanding the workload distribution across the team… and then also their individual performance metrics. So, you know, over the last 90 days, it's taking me 350 hours to respond to an email. When it gets assigned to me, I'm probably not going to be in my I'm not going to be working next Monday.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Right, right, right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So just making sure everyone's kind of like holding up their fair share of the bargain and providing those good performance metrics… the tag analytics. So understanding why are people reaching out? What are the hot topics we're seeing amongst the mailbox and the requests that we're getting on average… and then SLA analytics. So we can create SLA measurements on the back end. So let's say a new email comes in into investor relations. You know, we have a first response goal of one hour when those come in and get assigned, and we have a resolution goal of let's say 72 hours.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  This is going to show us how many times you violated these goals and how many times we were in compliance over that time period. So just making sure that we're driving towards those slas, and if not kind of identifying where we can improve.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Right.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the csat. So just, you know, we can send out those surveys to report from an aggregate and individual basis. You know, how people are performing and just general client feedback in general.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Right. I guess one other question that I just thought of was back to the assignment of… a specific email to a person. Is there any AI functionality there to try to, you know, figure out what the request or question is? And then kind of apply like, okay, this is on a scale of one to five. This is a five request. Let's assign it to this person versus another person?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So kind of like look at the priority level. Yeah. So not currently. So that is where this is going though. So we'll be able to identify query types and we'll have auto tagging capabilities which can prioritize it for you. It's not currently released in the platform but that will be released before the end of the year.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay. That's good to know.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then in terms of the admin panel, so this is just where we'll set it up, right? Creating those email share mailboxes, adding users, you know, leveraging the AI, whatever it might be. So I'll click into the support one here and when you click into these mailboxes, it creates, you know, a setting section in the middle to do things like manage the members who has access, you know, have that round Robin auto assignment that will equally distribute the emails amongst the investor relation teams as those queries come in.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Tracking custom fields to report on that data that we were showing on the right hand panel, and then also some of those automations that I mentioned, you know, when, if then functionality. So when a new conversation comes inbound, we've identified in the subject line, the body of text that there's the keywords, bug issue and discrepancy. We're then going to add the tag escalation to this. So it goes to the escalation queue. And then maybe, you know, assign it to max Payne because he's like our bug and issue discrepancy expert, whatever it might be. Okay. So just for ways to identify query types and then trigger actions around them, whether it's sending replies, updating statuses, sending notifications, whatever that might be.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  That's great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then the slas, you know, that safety net to ensure things aren't slipping between the cracks. And if they do, you know, the right people are getting notified. So let's say, you know, we can have different slas also based on different conversation types. So let's say it's a billing request. You know, the tag billing has been applied to the conversation. We're going to have a first response goal of one hour, a resolution goal of 72 hours. If this slips between the cracks of these goals that we have, you can choose to use notify to escalate the conversation.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, just another way to ensure, you know, we're driving towards these goals and if not the right people are being alerted and, you know, we can get more eyes on the conversation?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Yeah, that's great. But.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That's pretty much the main things I wanted to cover today, Tyler. So in terms of your, you know, your timeline to get up and running with a solution like this. Like what does it look like from your perspective on when you're looking to partner with a vendor for email management?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Yeah, I'd say it's like I kind of hinted at the beginning here, you know, we're just trying to evaluate what the market has, right? So, you know, yourself and others, you know, you're honestly our first conversation. So we're just trying to kind of get our feet wet of, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  What?

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Everyone offers and, you know, from there probably have some sort of proof of concept would be the next step. But, you know, I think we just need to kind of evaluate a few different vendors before we get to that stage.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent. But yeah, I think.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Timeline, probably, you know, in the next six to nine months, I don't think it's a super high priority, but I do think it's something we do need to address. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Yeah, we do have a proof of concept too free trial. So if that's something we want to set up as a next step, we can definitely get that up and running.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Okay, great. That's good to know.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But when would be a good time to touch base with you? Tyler, just throw something on the calendar so you can do like your rounds with other vendors, and then we can talk about setting up a potential proof of concept.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Yeah. So there's another person internally that's kind of working on a similar project. So it might make sense to have a follow up call with them as well.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  So, yeah, I'm planning to meet with them later this week and so maybe next week or the week after we plan to do a kind of a re, demo, if that works.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  And then we can, you know, go to the next steps from there.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. How's same time next week just to have something on the calendar? We can always move it around if need be for a demo.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  I think that should be fine.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. So, I'll just send it for 12 PM est on the twelfth.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  That works?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right, perfect. And I'll follow up this call recording also and some other information. But if you have any other questions in the meantime, feel free to let me know and looking forward to touching base next week.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Sounds good. Thanks, Cole. I really appreciate it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Take care, Tyler.

Tyler Kamps (tkamps@hamiltonlane.com):
  Have a good one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right. Bye.
