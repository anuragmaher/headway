Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  hey, Gilda.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Can you hear me okay?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Hey, Gilda? I can hear you fine. Can you hear me?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Oh, perfect. Yeah, yeah, I can hear you. Okay. I think just a minute to kick in. I don't know. I just saw that note taker thing. Thanks for adding the zoom in apologies. I've been sort of in and out of the office lately, so not been too up on my emails… no.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  No worries. You know, I kind of figured it just given how things are, you know, in the month of Jan. So, yeah, it was like my colleague mugunth, in fact advised me that, hey, you know, why don't we just share a meeting link across and I'm sure Gilda will accept it. One thing I missed out is adding Paul to the meeting. I hope he doesn't mind that.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Oh, that's fine. Yeah, this was more for us to catch up. So, yeah, if I sort of can I bring up to speed on our end, what we've been doing? So, we've been running essentially a live test at one of our academies. So, our south London team have been working of the solution. The mailbox has been set up with all the various settings and we've been having users email the support desk. So we've confirmed like all of the routing is working okay from the Google side and things like that. And the feedback so far has been quite positive. There are a couple of things I was hoping to run through just to understand whether the functionality is available or if we just have to work around them. Really. I know. I,

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  know. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Gilda. That sounds good. First thing. Glad to know that, you know, at least for the preliminary test for the south London shared mailbox, it's working fine. Now, if I'm correct, if I'm looking at the different shared inboxes set up, I believe this is the itds dash London shared mailbox you're referring to, right?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  That's the one, yeah, that's the one.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Okay, perfect. Glad to know that has been working well in terms of filtering that email from the central Gmail account into the shared mailbox. But yeah, I also see that you've set up a couple of automations like around 20 odd automations for the shared inbox. I'll be happy to, you know, address any questions you may have or any workflows that you're looking to build upon?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Okay. That would be brilliant. Thank you. So one of the first ones that the team and I kind of noticed was just around the starred views. Is there a way for us to have more than five? So some of our hubs have six or seven schools and the team leaders would like to have, you know, each of their schools starred. So it's kind of at the top. Is there a way for us to be able to have more of those starred views? Is there something in the background that can be done to allow that?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Good point. Gilda, right now, we do not have the ability to add more than five starred views from the custom views just to confirm if you're comfortable in sharing a screen and just showing me, would your team leaders want to have a single custom view for each of the different schools and then star them to the home screen?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  So let me share my screen and I can show you sort of what I'm talking about because I'm still getting to grips with the hiver terminology. So sometimes what I'm saying may not come across in the right way, spare me a second.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  So if we take the London mailbox for example, so I actually haven't set up starred views, I don't think to be honest, it's my team leader. So if, for example, so I've got all of these are all the schools here.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  And.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  if I want to assess, I'll do Bexley heath. I do newlands and Kingsley and see that's it because already three of them are taken up. I think by, well, the team leader would want like unassigned my team and those sorts of things at the top as well. So, you know, for example, if I have my team unassigned mine, I can only have like two school starred views.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's true.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  That's all. So, it was, yeah, understanding if we had the functionality to have more here really or if we could drag things up with, is there a possibility of having like starred groups there or anything like that?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  A quick question, right? This will, this is mostly important for the team leaders because they want to keep an eye out on all the school custom views and they want to make sure that there's nothing left in the probably in the open status, right? So if I understand the star views, so can you just click on any one of these views? Like let's say, can you click on the Kingsley view for example?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Sorry, the team one, did you say?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Oh, no, no, the Kingsley one please?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Oh, Kingsley. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  All right. And if you can just click on the filters on the top, right? So I just want to look at the criteria as to why you would want an email. Okay? So open pending and Kingsley. So essentially, you want to ensure or the team leaders want to ensure that there are no emails left either in the open or the pending status for either of the schools, right?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  If I understand correctly, yes. Yeah, I think it's just for ease of use. You know, if you've got your, the views you use mainly at the top, you know, it just makes it easier because we're… you know, operating on this, you know, regional basis, that list can get quite large. Yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  I agree. So what I would suggest, right? As a quick fix, and this is, as you mentioned, right? This would be mainly used by the team leaders to ensure that there's nothing left in the open and the pending status, what you can do is you can create another view which is a consolidated view of all of the schools that are in the open and the pending status, right? So you can call it like a TL view if you want and have all of the tags of that specific school of the schools of that specific region and apply the open and the pending status. So, you know, as a TL, they can just keep an eye out on that one view. And whenever they open up or go to that view under the Google list views, they will see the tags of that specific school visible over there, right? So at a glance, they can see that, hey, this email is in the open status and it belongs to for example, the Kingsley school. Yeah. So, yeah.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  This.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  would make it much easier rather than having to toggle through, you know, 10, 12 different views for a TL.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Okay. No, that makes sense. All right. Thank you. I'll feed that back and it's just, you know, really understanding these kind of workarounds to help the team leaders and some of the ops managers kind of have those views and just, you know, streamlining it a little bit. So, thank you. I will get them to implement that and see how they get on.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. And just for our, you know, future roadmap purposes, let's… say, for example, if this is something that's needed by the team to add more than five views, how would you categorize them today? Like between important, nice to have good to have or urgent?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Sorry, repeat that again, the.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Feature request that you had, you know, to have more than five custom views as starred or favorited to the home screen. And if you have to categorize them within, you know, an urgency, let's say if it's good to have nice to have or important or if it's urgent by your team, where would you categorize them? I.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Would say it would be nice to have it doesn't you know, stop the team working or using the platform. However, I think it would allow for the team to sort of, you know, have a better understanding of what's going on site so that, you know, the all open tickets for all sites is definitely useful. But also, I think the team leaders like to just pop into each school view just to see how many are open, how many are pending, you know, how many are bouncing between the user and the member of the team and things like that. But I can definitely feed that back and they'll just have to use it for now. But yeah, I'd appreciate if it's added to any sort of roadmap considerations. That would be amazing.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Gilda, we'll definitely take this up with our product team and keep you updated on any progress for this particular feature. But just from an overall visibility standpoint for a team leader, I think having that one single view for all of the schools in one place would add more value, making it easier for them to just go over that particular email and ensure nothing is left in the open and the pending status?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  All right, perfect. Makes sense. Thank you. London.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Gilda, if you have any.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Other questions just on this as well. I'm assuming it's again one that may be something for development. It's can we can't is there a way to drag and drop these? So you could move the order around? So, for example, having the Harvey and the AI, you know, views would be useful, having them more towards the bottom rather than at the top. I don't know if there's any way we can order these or is it just built in that way?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Great point, Gilda. So the views that you've added to your favorites, right? The ones that are starred, they can be reordered or rearranged based on the way you'd like to have it. So the team brexit, sorry, bixie, height, if I'm reading that correctly, newlands and unassigned, those particular views that you have on your screen can be rearranged. However the ones that are under all views. So Harvey, thank you. And below all of those views cannot be rearranged, they are arranged alphabetically. What I recommend is right, you know, based on priority, you can add like the number one, two, three in front of them, and that's like a workaround. I know it's not the best fix? But yeah, it's a workaround to ensure like let's say, for example, wishmore cross would be something important for the team rather than having it all at the bottom. I can add the number one in front of wishmore, and it would take it all the way to the top. However, the Harvey, yeah, however I do need to point out that the views that you see Harvey, thank you AI co pilot. They will always remain to the top since they are the default views… no.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Problem that's absolutely fine. Let me just make a couple of notes so that the team that are testing this are aware of kind of exactly what the limitations are and sort of the workarounds. Oops, hold on. Where is that going?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  I don't know but it seems I'm offline for some reason. Sorry, I work across to two screens, you see, or two devices. Okay? Oh, that's just disappeared. Let me just make a couple of quick notes.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Lovely. Thank you. And just kind of as we're talking about usability, something else that the team raised was just tags. So the, sorry, I'll just move the zoom window so I can see that better as we kind of develop this obviously gets quite long. So there's a lot of scrolling that the team will need to do. So we have our school… tags, our SLA tags and our almost root cause tags. Is there a way to group these tags? So instead of having just one long list of tabs, you have a tag group. So you have like SLA, you have school, you have root cause, is there any way for us to do that at all?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Great point. So, right now, we don't have the ability to have like tags and nested tags. What I can recommend to kind of, you know, work around this is to use another feature that we call custom fields because what you can do is you can group custom fields together, right? So let's say, for example, if there are a list of schools that you want to have in one place, so let's say, you know, the schools remain static, they're not going to increase or decrease over a short period of time. So in that case, what you can do is rather than having individual tags for each school, you can have a dropdown and create a custom field dropdown for the different schools for a particular shared mailbox. Yep. So under custom fields here, you have, yeah, you can click on, add a custom field. And yeah, under the dropdown, you can then have the ability to create a custom, a field list of schools and your team members can then, you know, click on the dropdown, select the relevant school wherever applicable. And it does work very similar to tags. The only thing I do need to highlight, you know, because this is a newly added feature. So there's a lot of progress while it works really well. There are certain, you know, things that we are still further developing. So, for example, under hive analytics, you don't really get a complete section just for your custom views, like you get for tags, however you can still pull out custom through filters. You can still pull out data for the different, you know, the different views created. Yeah.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  So one.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Quick question here, right now, let's say, for example, root cause is something that you may think or consider created or creating a custom field for right now, I would not recommend things like root cause for example, because they can be an overlap, like for example, one email may have a user management issue as well as a Google drive issue. For example, let's say if you receive that ticket with a custom field, you can only select one option. Unlike a tag, you can add multiple tags of the same category to an email thread with a custom field. You can add only one option, right? So it would be, a good use case for the name of the school. Because I think 100 percent of the time when a ticket comes in, it will only belong to one specific school. This is, it's highly unlikely that a ticket, a same ticket may belong to two different schools, right? Yeah.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  That's correct. I mean the school tags have pretty much been created more for use for the automation so that when an email comes in from a particular domain, it tags it with the school. And then that's how we set up the views and the filtering and things. So I don't expect if I'm honest staff will use the school one very much because as the ticket comes into the mailbox, it should, that, there's no scenario where it wouldn't have the right tag if that makes sense because it's come from that domain… yeah, with the root cause. So the way we work currently is there are just single root cause codes. So you can only close a ticket with one root cause. So there's probably I get what you're saying in terms of it could be user management but also a Google problem. So we'll have to maybe have some guidelines for staff around which one to use in different scenarios where there's a bit of that overlap. So that's just fine. But yeah, I'll have a play around with it then because I think, yeah, the members of the team that have been using it said there's just a lot of scrolling to find different tags. So this might be useful. And I like the fact that you have to, you can set a requirement for that to need to be selected. The ticket is closed because that really helps us with all of the reporting in terms of root causes as well. So I'll have a play around. So in that case, I can then take away the tags for root cause and we use the dropdown fields. Instead. Could we use dropdown fields for slas as well? Would that work?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, absolutely. I think for, the only drawback is we can use it for slas, but then we would have to set up like a double automation in the sense that let's say if your team member selects the P1 SLA, we would need to set up an automation so that when up, when the team member selects the P1 custom field hiver then automatically applies the P1 tag, so that the P1 tag can then be used to create an SLA. So it's while it can be used, there is a workaround for it. But yeah, we would need to set up a couple of extra automations if you're okay with that. I think it would be a good user interface for your team, to interact with. Yeah, yeah.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  So, I'm thinking that maybe if we have a custom field for the root causes and for the slas, they wouldn't really need to mess around much with tags themselves. They'll be there but they won't really need to do much with them. And so maybe we pivot from being so tag focused and we use the tags for the automations in the background and we use custom fields to, for the kind of the day to day usability. But I'll have a mess around test it with the team and we'll sort of see how that works versus just selecting things from the tag list, perhaps.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah, makes sense. Makes sense. So, just to reiterate once again about using custom fields for slas, we would have to set up both the tags and the custom field. So let's say if a P1 custom field is selected, I would then automatically applies the P1 tag to that specific email thread. And then based on the tag, we can then set up a specific SLA for P1 type of emails.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. I'm quite excited. I've got a lot to do today in terms of testing. I haven't really looked at the custom fields. I thought it was more around, you know, when someone logs a ticket, what comes in the response body, email body and things like that. So that's really exciting.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Lovely. As we're talking about SLA. So I've set up, I think one SLA, and my question was are they set up per mailbox or is there a way to share them between mailboxes just for ease of setup, they're the same across the board? Is there a way to have like them from the top and shared out? Or is it a case of I have to go into each mailbox and set them up individually?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  No, that's a great point. Gilda, very similar to automations. Right now. You would have to set them up individually for each shared mailbox. Now, this is something that we've really taken ahead with our product team and we've asked them to, you know, for enterprise level customers have the ability to create automations for all of the shared inboxes rather than each individual shared inbox, likewise with the SLA. So I'll definitely push this forward once again with our product.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Okay. Thank you very much. So I'm just having a quick look to see if there is anything else and that the team have raised and I'll share this Google sheet… with you. Maybe one you already have access to. I'll double check. It was. We, it's the same sheet we used for the pilot we did last year as well. I've just created a separate tag for this year.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Yes. So customer portal, if I show you quickly, I was just wondering, let me leave that up later whether the default sort of… fields are able to be amended. So for example, we're gonna use the customer portal for our change control just to keep things succinct. And so, you know, everyone kind of answers the same same question. Hold on. Has he changed this? No, ignore me. I am on the wrong one. Bear with me one second. I'll go into the one that was created for the change control. So the customer portal.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Okay. So if I go submit a request, so for example, I think the top three are kind of the inbuilt ones. I've been able to change that, the, you know, the subject title and whatnot, but I was wondering, can I change the field types? I'd love the top one to be a drop down? The second one just to be like a short sentence rather than a paragraph. Is there any way to do that or is it just sort of built in and we need to, work with it?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  I believe, you know, that we have made improvements to our submission form, giving you more liberty to the way you design a submission form, right? From the top, the drop downs to short messages, long messages. So let me double check this with our product manager method and get back to you on this. Yeah. So I'll send this across in an email. Yeah.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  That's absolutely fine. Thank you. I mean, it's not the end of the world. We can shuffle the order of things around if that makes sense, but it would just be a lot easier, if we had a drop down for school, let's say, to avoid like typos and things like that… and?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Gilda, just to make sure I've captured your request or your workflow correctly from top to down. Can you just walk me through as to how exactly you'd like to have this submission form?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Yeah, of course. So at the top, we'd like it to be the school. And rather than it just being one sentence, we'd like for that to be a drop down at the very top. And then the… second option, we'd like that just to be a short title one so similar to what school is now rather than the paragraph one. Okay? And then that's it really, there's only two we'd want to change. The others are absolutely fine.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Perfect. So let me check with my colleague on this and get back to you on it. Yeah.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Thank you. Just have a quick look, see if there's anything else. Some of them are kind of questions for us around working with third parties and things like that, which I'll pick up. The last one. I promise last one it's we can't seem to view amend the view sharing options once we've created them. So let… me just share this tab instead. So if, for example, I'm in the London, sorry… not here. I'm in the London mailbox… it's all views. It's been flagged by the team leader. There's no option to then sort of share with anyone else. It's only at the point of creation. So let's say we get a new member of the team. We're not able to just share… that with them, share the view.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  The views that are created over here, like let's say, let's look at the new lens. For example, right now, the new lens view, since it's already shared with the entire team. Whenever a new member is added to hiver and added to this specific shared inbox by default, they should have access to that new lens view. So you don't really need to share the view with anyone else or any new member. By default. It's accessible by anyone who's added to the shared mailbox right now, as far as the views are concerned, we just give you two type of shareability options and this is controllable by the admins only. So, essentially, the first shareable option is share it with the entire team and the other one is only visible to yourself. Now, if you're a member in hiver or a supervisor in hiver, you don't have the ability to share it with everyone within the team. It's only the mailbox admins and the admins that have the ability to share a view with everyone across the team. And the way you amend that is, let's say, you know, accidentally, you've created a view and you've shared it with only yourself and you want to make that shareable for the entire team, then you simply click on that view once again. So if you just want to click on any view, the Kingsley view, for example, yeah. And what you would need to do is open up the filters option on the top right? Once you click on a specific view. And so the top right, the filters view and on the top right, you have the double swish. So you just have to save it again. So if you click on the double swish once again, please, it's better to save as. And here you just give it a name once again and then choose who you want to have it visible to.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Oh, perfect. OK. Maybe that's what he meant. Sorry, it's not very clear from the notes, but maybe that's what he meant. He created a view for himself and then couldn't see where to change it. So let me just make a quick note… and you're.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  right, Gilda, you know, that tends to be the case most of the times when they create a view, accidentally, you save it just for yourself and then you try to re edit it. But, yeah, this is the way you get to change that.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Just make a couple quick notes apologies.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Amazing. Thank you. That would be brilliant. And that was it really other than that some very minor ones around, does hiver have a dark view for the hiver panel? Obviously Google does. But when you open up the hiver panel, is there any dark view at all? I don't I've not seen anything, but.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Not not really. We don't have a dark view. Gmail has its dark view, but I believe the admin panel still continues to remain in white since we don't really support different themes. But again, that's a, good feature request that we can add to our… no.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Problem that's fine. As I said, it's not really, it doesn't really make a massive difference because the bulk of the screen for colleagues that need dark mode will be in dark mode. It's just the panel.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Understood. Yes, yes, right. So Gilda, do you have any other questions, for us today or before? I just wanted to check with you on a couple of things. Yeah.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Of course. I mean, I think it would be useful just to kind of update you on sort of timelines as well. So we're looking at having this going fully live at the end of February. I'm going to meet with the team leaders and give them access… sort of around the fifteenth sixteenth of feb, that sort of time. So it would be and just do a quick run through with them. But it would be useful kind of maybe a week or so after that, to have a session with yourself or a colleague just to go through any sort of, you know, a bit of training and perhaps to answer any questions similar to what we've done today, maybe with the group of team leaders?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Yeah, yeah, that's a good point, you know, Gilda. And in fact, that's exactly what I was going to ask you in regards to timelines baby. Thank you for that update and also wanted to share a quick update from our side. You know, there's been a bit of changes internally. So that's the reason why I have my colleague mugunth, who's added to the call. Mugunth will be, you know, managing lyft schools going ahead. So he would be your main point of contact going ahead. I've kept him updated about all the progress we've made so far. Also given him a good handover about the internal documents and also the workflow image that you've sent with me.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  So he's brought up to speed and he will have the next session with you. So let's say we set up a session for tentatively for like the fifth of feb, he can conduct that training session for the team leaders, answer any questions. However, what I would suggest is if you can set up maybe a call for sometime next week just to make sure that next week or end of next week, you know, so that we can just make sure that we are on top of things before your team, you know, tends to go live.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Yeah, no problem. How does, let me just have a quick look, how does Thursday work for you work for you both?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  So, mugunth, if you just want to quickly?

Mugunth:
  Yeah… Thursday same time works best for me which is on feb. Yeah.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  So if we say 10, 10 o'clock yeah, sure. Sure.

Mugunth:
  I'll after this meeting, I'll just send you a quick meeting invite to you. You can just add the other relevant stakeholders who needs to be part of this discussion. And.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  we can take it forward. Yeah. Oh, that's fine. So, I was just in my calendar so you'll send me the invite and I can add in, yeah, yeah, I'll send.

Mugunth:
  It to you. Just give me a couple of minutes. I'm almost creating it after this meeting ends, the invite will pop on top of your inbox.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Awesome. Thank you. And then, yeah. So did we want to pencil anything in February or should we discuss next week and have some more and firm up the sort of training session then?

Mugunth:
  My calendar is up to date. What we could do is we could first address all the, you know, the challenges which the team leaders are having in the next call. Once that's ironed out. Maybe we could definitely plan something in the mid of feb, I'm open for anything. But my suggestion is let's finish off this meeting. Then we do a follow up session preferably in the mid of feb, and then we could plan the goal update. Yeah.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Yeah, that sounds great. Yeah.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Thank you. Awesome. All right, Gilda. Anything else that we can address before we, one thing I wanted to check with you, right?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Something important for us to keep a track of. Just looking at the shared inboxes. I noticed that you've added the different regions. So glad to see that. However, I also noticed there's like for example, ithelpdesk Google at liftscores org. So I just wanted to understand how is that different from the other shared inboxes?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Yeah. So we have sort of like central specialist groups who have, who look after things like the Google backend sort of Google admin or have access to filtering changes. So not all of the team are able to like unfilter websites for example. And currently they will escalate tickets to a team central team. So those mailboxes have been created for that. So yeah, essentially that's why we have them. So what we'll have to do is my understanding is we have to give, we have to add almost everyone as a member for them to be able to see the dropdown to move it to that inbox. Don't. We, is that, how it works?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Could you repeat that once again? Gilda? No.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  That's okay. So for example, I'm a normal engineer at school and I get a request for filtering. I can't do it. So I need to move that ticket to the filtering team. So in our current system, it's just a dropdown and you say right here's you know, send it to the filtering team and it sends it to them. Okay with, however, I believe we discussed it at one of our previous meetings. And my understanding was that, so if I take, let me take a ticket and I can sort of show you and what I mean? Beth, let me just go back into here. So if I take… this one for example, and I want to let's… say this was a filtering ticket?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. I would.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Have to remove it from this shared inbox and then add it to the, is that how I would move it to the inbox? Or is there like another way? Could I use a custom field? Maybe for example, I don't know.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Oh, good. Good point. Gilda. Yeah, mugunth, do you want to take that one? Yeah.

Mugunth:
  So, yes, Gilda, the manual way of doing this thing is kind of, you know, removing this and then kind of, you know, adding it to the intended shared mailbox, but actually what we could do is we could set up an automation. So the automation is what you could do is first create a custom field for the list of teams. This particular ticket needs to be kind of intended. Let's say that like five schools, just create a custom field, having all these five schools. Then what you could do is you could go to the automations and that you should select the triggering action as when the custom field is updated and the school is school a kind of remove the conversation from school a, and kind of add the conversation to school B, we could set up an automation tool, which kind of mimics what you've been doing manually so far. Okay?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  I think that would make it a lot better because it would mean, you know, not everyone has to have that mailbox in their Gmail, because it could get quite messy as we maybe split teams or expand teams so that's brilliant. I'll have a play with that and let you know how I get on next week.

Mugunth:
  Yes.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Awesome. Okay. Yeah. So.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Yeah. As rightly, mugunth mentioned that with the dropdown we can set up an automation, remove it from inbox. A, add it to inbox. B. The only thing is, as, you know, mugunth would have probably already alluded to is that the inbox needs to be a part of hiver. It doesn't matter if the member is added to that inbox or not.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Yeah. Okay. That's fine. Yeah, I've got the mailboxes set up, but then I don't need to be a member to be able to do that dropdown and automation to kick in. Do I?

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  That is right. You don't need to be a member of the other shared inbox from your very own inbox. You can simply select the relevant shared inbox, the next shared inbox, where it needs to be added to. Again, you can create them as custom fields or tags, whichever is easier for the team to manage. And accordingly, hiver will then add it to the next shared inbox based on the automation that supports that workflow.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  Okay. That's awesome. Thank you.

Mugunth:
  Yeah, awesome.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Perfect. All right. Anything else Gilda that we can assist you with before we end?

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  No, not that I can think of. Obviously, there's plenty for me to sort of test and get the team to test as well. So hopefully we have some good feedback next week as well. And thank you for talking through these sort of additional ways of working and features. I think it will streamline things a little bit more. So the team are going to be quite happy to test these out as well.

Leander F (leander.f@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Sounds good. Gilda. Well, thank you for your time, pleasure working with you and we'll connect soon. See.

Gilda Agostini (gagostini@liftschools.org):
  You. Likewise. Thank you. Both. Take care. Have a good day. Bye bye.
