Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, what's going on, Sam? How's everything been?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Good. Yeah. So, yeah, thanks for setting this up. So on the pricing topics or… I guess more the plan for hiver topics. So, the normal plan does not support shared inboxes. Is that correct?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Which plan?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Like the entry level like free plan?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  You only get up to one share mailbox. Okay. I'd recommend for what you're looking to do, definitely purchase the growth. I think that will, you know, gives you the tags, give you some automations, you can create slas and do some reporting as well. I think the growth would suffice. Okay?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  And that one's five inboxes?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That gives you up to three share mailboxes?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  I think so. Yeah, I think that was my main question then, and then the price, sorry, I can see it's only five bucks a month?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So it's a 35 bucks on a month to month basis. And then 25 dollars if you commit to a year.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Do you know which like direction you'd like to go for the annual or the month to month?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  It probably would be annual if we go that option. The other option we're thinking about is just… like shared mailboxes with Google's just like delegate access that has licensing costs as well. But yeah. So hiver or that one. So those are two options.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. Do you know when you and the team will make a decision on if you want to move forward with hiver?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Probably this week.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, cool. And I can send you, so we do sell in buckets of five too. So like, you know, five, 10, 15, 20. Should I send you over a quote for five users on our annual commitment?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  I think so. Yeah, that'd be good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. And would you have like some time tomorrow to touch base on which direction you'd want to go?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Yes, that should work. I can also just follow up via email either way.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. And just for my internal notes, does it, like, are you leaning towards hiver? As a solution? Does that seem like the direction you are going to move?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  I think so, although I noticed, so I was chatting with people yesterday, it looks like Google has a shared mailbox in like sort of staged availability right now? So I'm looking into that with Google workspace as well?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Like the Google groups?

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Not Google groups. It's like a proper like shared inbox. It's basically the same as like creating a user account and doing delegated access. With the only real difference being you can manage it from the admin portal instead of having to manage it from like the user settings.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. No, that makes sense. So, I guess, yeah, just shoot me an email tomorrow because I know the trial is expiring on the tenth. So, let me know which direction you want to go, if you want to move forward with that. I'll send you over the contract for the five users on growth. And then, we'll just kind of go from there.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  Okay. Sounds good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Thanks so much, Sam. I'll, I'll talk to you in a bit.

Sam Durston (sam@durstongear.com):
  All right. Sounds good. See ya all.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Take care bye.
