Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Anish. How are you?

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Hi, Yukta. Can you hear me?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, I can hear you. Can you hear me?

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Yeah, I can hear you. Apologies. I was having some technical issues, but, yeah, apologies for that. And for joining five minutes late. How are you doing today?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. I'm doing well. Thank you. Hope you're doing good as well.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  I'm doing good. Thanks, Yukta.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. How has it been since we? I think your account got suspended today. I'm sorry for that. So, I just further extended it by like a couple of days so that the workflow does not get disrupted. Did you get a chance to go through the tool after the changes that we made? Yeah?

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  I did. I also started tagging. So yesterday, I spent some time and I went through each email to help with the AI tagging and I tagged a lot of vendors and I assigned it to the team. I created a new team for finance because we didn't do that because I'm trying to train the AI. I also gave the team a little bit of onboarding session to the tool and asked them to share their opinion. But yeah, I was going to ask, if possible to expand by maybe two or three days because I see our CEO, he hasn't accepted the invite yet. So I did want him to have a feel for it for like two or three days because he also uses the orders emails, but I think he was just very busy that he didn't get a chance to accept the invite and actually like access the tool yet. Got.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It, who is this person? Because right now, I see in total five people and everybody has accepted the invite. Is there someone else? Okay?

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  No, he probably accepted late yesterday, then it's Abdel.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Abdel, yes. Yes. I can see Abdel here, and I think he has accepted the invite. So he must.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Be, yeah, I think it was yesterday because when I checked last week, I logged off, I saw that he had, he didn't accept it and I reminded him, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. I have extended your trial? Should we do it till Wednesday next week? Fourth?

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Or fifth? Yeah. I was thinking Wednesday as well. That sounds good. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. I have done that from my side so that you have enough time to explore it. But what do you think so far? Shanice? Like do you think hiver is sort of making things easier? I know it's going to take some time to actually get used to the tool itself first. But once we get there, do you think it's going to sort of help you declutter the inbox and make it a lot easier to manage? I.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Think it might so like something I would say though is that I expected to be able to tag and assign without having to go into the mail itself?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's going to do that only, right? I.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Thought by browsing through the mail, I'm sorry, can you repeat that? So, I mean, if I, oh, no problem. I'm saying if I manually have to, I know AI will eventually get trained and things will be auto assigned, right? But I'm talking about as at current manually, I'm having to go into the mail and then sometimes that hiver admin panel on the right for each email, sometimes the admin not the admin, the hiver panel for each email doesn't pop up until I click on the hiver sign, no.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So that you have to actually keep it open then. So if you, it's either ways, you can put it, right? If you click on the hiver icon there, then the activity panel comes up, right? So I would suggest just keep it like that. Do not press on the hiver icon again to remove it. Because if you do that, then in the next email that you open again, you'll have to press the hiver icon. So just keep it open only so that whenever you are opening any new email after that, the activity panel is going to pop up automatically. You don't have to press the hiver icon for that.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Okay. That makes sense. I also thought that if there was a way that I could tag and assign teams without actually opening the email, like if I could do it on the outside of the email, but I don't think that's possible.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I understand. Let me see. I think that is possible, let me just confirm it once in my hiver… you can actually apply tags. So what you have to do essentially is let me just share my screen. So without having to open any email, we can actually give a tag. So what you would do in that case is, can you see my screen? Shanice?

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Yeah, I can. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, this is the share inbox, right? I have these many unassigned emails right now. So anyways, I can either be, it could be an unassigned email or an email in my section regardless of it. But this is an email which I have not gone into yet. So what you can do, you can just select that email and click on these manage tags icon here and you can just apply the right tag from here itself. I'm not.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Sure if I'm understanding, sorry, yutka one more time. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You click on any email from the outside itself, just select that email and you will see these buttons, no.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Okay. Just click the tags.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  One, and then you can just apply the appropriate tag from here itself. Okay? So you don't have to then go into the entire email. If you understand what this email is about, you know, this tag has to be applied. You don't necessarily have to go inside of it and then apply tag from here, which I think which I understand can take more time. So you can just do it from here itself. Is this what you were asking?

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Yes, that's what I was asking exactly that. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So in terms of the automation kicking in, it's just, you know, the initial activity that AI has to be because AI is also new to your business, right? It doesn't know how you function. So it requires for you to obviously, you know, just train it to make your life easier going forward. So, I think it's just the initial instance that you have to don't do it for every tag right now. You don't have to hurry that, do it for a couple of tags just to see how it's actually then picking from the eleventh time onwards. And then you can just continue doing that as you click as you receive any email.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Okay, perfect. I'm definitely going to try that out. I'm going to continue to hit the 10, trying to hit the 10 target that I can for each vendor just so the AI can hopefully auto populate from Monday or from the weekend rather than we get any. And then I want to get the team's feedback in by Tuesday as well just to hear their thoughts and how they've been feeling. But so far I'm feeling quite positive. So yeah, I'm just waiting for abdaal to actually use it to get the team's feedback. And then I'll keep you posted.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cool. And were you able to set up the automation for other two teams? I think we did it for one.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Team. I did. Okay, perfect. Perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, the current workflow looks something like this wherein we are using tags to classify our emails in terms of what in terms of the topic. And then from there, we are then manually filling the custom field, understanding which department it has to go to. And then once we choose the right department, that's where the automation kicks in and it gets assigned to the right person within that department. So this is the flow that we're going with, right? Yes.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  That's right. And it's been working that way.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Great. Then let's connect on Tuesday. Then in that case, just to get the final check.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Let's do Wednesday morning, why I say because Tuesday we only start at this time. So I know you can't do much later as well.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So maybe Wednesday?

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Morning around this time would be better?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Oh, Wednesday, I can do Wednesday? Yes. Is it possible to connect half an hour earlier on Wednesday? Yeah.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Yeah, yeah. It's fine. I can do half an hour earlier.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. I think that's fine. Then I'll just share the invite with you for Wednesday and then we can take this forward. Also. Shanice just wanted to understand if everything goes well from here, like on Wednesday, your trial will also come to an end. So what would be the next step from your side? Have you already discussed about this internally with the management or?

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  So, yeah, I did discuss it already, but because of the trial now, I haven't given him any feedback on the trial. So I just want him to test it out for himself as well. So I'm happy that he accepted the invite. In terms of management. It's just me and him. There's no one else in our management team. And then it's the team. So I'm waiting to find out from the team and their feedback, but I'm going to get feedback today and then I'm going to ask them tomorrow on Tuesday as well. So essentially, the next steps if they're happy and if we feel like it is working for us and it is helping declutter, then I would say, we would take on hiver almost immediately.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. And could you tell me a little bit about Abdul? What is his role within the team? Yeah.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  So, it's, very, vast. So he uses many hats and sometimes he's the one that actually does orders, he phones customers, he does everything, but essentially he's our CEO. So he's really hands on. So he uses the orders email as well, a lot to sometimes pay vendors, to sometimes check queries. So he's a bit of a round Robin. So that's why I wanted him to actually access, the tool and to see if it's actually making a difference with us during day to day?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Got makes sense. So, do you want him to become an admin as well so that he have, he has access to admin panel if he wants to explore something because currently he's not you.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Can make it, you can. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. I've just made him the admin so that he has access to everything. Perfect. Looks good.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Okay. No problem. I will connect with you on Wednesday morning, then you start that two minutes earlier?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I have already sent the invites to you so we can connect and then we'll take it forward from there.

Shanice Chetty (shanice@solarguyspro.com):
  Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. No.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Worries. Thank you, Shanice. Take care bye.
