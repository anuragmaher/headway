Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  nope.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, Jenny. How are you?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Hello there. Yeah, good. Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Shall we get started with the discussion or expecting more people to join in as well?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  No, just myself. Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Great. Awesome. Then let's get started. I know you booked the demo with us. So I'll be helping you with the evaluation today. My name is Yukta and I'm the senior account executive here at hiver, to start with. I would love to understand in terms of what exactly you're trying to achieve and how that fits with hiver. I will be in a position then to sort of, you know, give you a brief demonstration of the platform and show you exactly what we have.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Yep. Sure. So I'm trying to plan forward. So we currently have three, possibly four email… addresses linked to sort of contact forms and stuff from our website, and they all currently come in to me as we expand. There will be two other people that would be needing to have access to those email addresses. And I'm just looking for a smooth way to ensure that everything gets picked up and covered off and can be escalated up to me if it needs to be, or to another member of the team. And so it doesn't get duplicated. If, you know, two people reply to the same email. So I'm just looking forward probably to the start of next year is when we're going to need it. But just to try and make things a little bit more smooth.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. So if I understand this, right? Currently, you are the only one who is handling all the emails coming across these email addresses. Is that right?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Yeah, that's correct. So they all come into my inbox and moving forward. Two possibly three other people would need access to those. And so, rather, and so I'm just looking for, it. Looks like I should be able to have it sort of come into a central place… for dealing with.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. So if I may ask like how is this currently set up? Do you log into these three to four accounts individually? Or have you put the forwarding? Yeah. So they.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  currently come into my outlook email box. So I've got five, I think different email inboxes within my outlook portal. And so I just deal with them each through there. No one else has got access to them currently.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Cool. And if you like the tool or if you finalize the tool, I understand you are thinking ahead which is great because currently, as you are alone handling things, it's still manageable. But as you have more people, then it can become a little chaotic in terms of being able to handle all these accounts. But in terms of like implementation, are you looking to implement this beforehand or would you be looking into it once you have the team joining in or have more people coming in?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  I would think probably realistically we would probably be looking at January next year. So after Christmas probably.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. After.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Christmas. Yeah. Once the team are in and sort of settled in a bit.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Perfect. That makes sense. And in terms of, you know, the, you know, something that you would want to absolutely have, I know you mentioned having a centralized place to manage these inboxes. Anything else that sort of will help you ease out the evaluation for yourself because there are plenty of tools out there, right? So anything that is on top of your mind as like?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  No, I mean, and it's almost more what I don't need when I've looked at them sort of to see what is out there in the market. I don't want like a support ticketing system. It's not that type of thing. I don't really need any reporting or SLA, sort of standards, you know, how quickly did someone reply or anything? I don't really need that? I just need to ensure that messages don't get lost or missed or duplicated. Really so sort of quite simple. I think sort of low end requirement, I think.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That perfectly makes sense. Great. Then let me just show you as to how hiver works. I'm pretty sure this will cover most of the things that you just mentioned without making it too complicated. And having, you know, having you to introduce a typical ticketing system for all of you?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Stick to more simpler approach here. So as you can see my screen here, Jenny works on this URL called app hiverhq. Com. And from here, you would be able to manage all these inboxes. And I think it could work in your favor that hiver works very closely to, you know, how you're working currently in outlook. So from the learning perspective, also, it will be easy for you to sort of acclimatize with this new tool. So what you will do here is you will log into your individual accounts. May I ask, do you have your own individual email address? Yes, you do, right with Jenny at the rate which is just yours, right? Perfect. You'll be logging in from there. And we will create the different shared mailboxes associated with these four to five email addresses that you just spoke about. So that you have separate places to see what is flowing into which inbox here. And I'm sure you must be doing this in outlook as well. Now, the difference that you would see is we will be adding the other individuals into these inboxes as well as for the need rate. So if you need your colleague who is joining in to be part of the finance inbox, you'll add them there. And likewise, you can add as per how you would like, okay, keep it now while you are creating this shared mailboxes, and of course, you would not want to switch between your outlook to manage your personal account and here to manage your shared mailbox. So you can connect your personal account as well. So that any email that are coming directly to you which you don't want to share with anyone, you can still manage your personal inbox within hiver itself. Right now, from the shared mailbox perspective, I'll just take an example of the sales and success inbox that I have right here. Let's say this is one of the inboxes that we connect within hiver. And let's say you have about three people who are part of this inbox, right? So it's not just you now, you have other two people who are also looking after this inbox. So to avoid any duplicated efforts or making sure we are not missing out any emails. These sections right here will help you defining your day to day workflow wherein you would have all the new emails that are being written here will come into this designated section called unassigned. Which essentially means that these are brand new emails that nobody has started working on yet. Okay, anyone who picks this email or clicks on this email will have this activity panel pop up on the right side from where you will be defining the ownership as to who needs to work among three of us, right? Let's assign this to myself. Now, this activity first of all will get recorded. So anything that we do in hiver, any activity that we perform, everything gets recorded so that we know at all times who is making what changes. And as you define the ownership here, this email will now flow into the mind section of the person to whom we have, you know, sort of assigned this to just a minute. I think this… is… okay. Let me just pick this one. There we go. Yeah, I think there is some friction there in that one. So let's say this is not assigned to anyone. And if I give the ownership to myself, so there will be two things that will happen, right? Number one, this email will get, this activity will get recorded here. And this email will get assigned to me. There we go. And we'll go into the mind section. And from here in the mind section, I know that these are the emails that I am responsible for. And we all three of us at all times know that, okay, we only need to focus on these emails so that there are no duplicated efforts and we are not missing out on anything, right? Even for the transparency to maintain across the team. We can still go into the team section here. And we can still see across everyone as to who is handling what. So that if in case let's say Manoj is out of office, he's not available. I need to pick his emails on his behalf. I can just easily go ahead and sort of, you know, reassign those to myself so that all of them come to my radar, right? So this is something that we can absolutely do. And with that, while you're working on any email as well, right? Let's say I reply to this, I can still collaborate with my colleagues. So you will be having new team members coming in. So of course, it's like a no brainer that you would require. They would require a lot of collaborations with at least in the initial months, right? So whenever they're working on any email, there are a couple of things that you can set for them. Number one is email templates. So templates are something that you can set up for the repetitive sort of emails that you have been handling so far alone. And this is something that they can sort of, you know, pick and apply for the such emails that are coming in. Of course, they can modify it as well. And while they are doing this, if they need help or if they want to collaborate with you or somebody else, they can save their. Draft as it is, if they have already written something which will get saved here and from this note section, they can collaborate with anyone. So if I want to collaborate with my colleague and ask him to review this for me before I send this, yeah, I can do that, right? So at all times, we have single ownership so that we are not confused who is handling what yet people can come in and collaborate on the same email. So this could be helpful as well from the collaboration?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  So once you've invited someone to collaborate, does it then pop into their mine inbox on the side for them to look at or how do they know that there is something for them to look at?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So they will receive a notification in this bell icon. So whenever I'm mentioning, so I just mentioned Rakesh here, right? So Rakesh will receive a notification here that, you know, like I have one notification here, right? You were mentioned on a note. So likewise, he'll get a notification. He'll click on it and he will be coming on the same page that I was, he can see the entire email chain. He can see my draft as well. And we both then can sort of, you know, connect here, can converse in regards to this particular email. Okay?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  So you can almost message each other on the side to say you need to say this or you shouldn't have said that and you can then edit. So it's still you that replies. Okay. I understand that's useful.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So here, if, in case eventually he wants to take this up, he can also assign it to himself. So that is available. So we can do that as well. And once I have my final response, I come here and I can just send this to the customer. And this would be our last step. So if I'm not expecting any more responses from the other side, I can just simply close the email so that all your closed emails will reside in our designated section which is closed, and this is where all your closed ones will be. And the pending ones will be in here in the pending section. And in case you're getting any response on these ones, they will populate back into the mind section and they will change the status to open again so that you can pick those up.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah… basic workflow that I wanted to show you apart from that, of course, you have tags as well, which if you want you can use to categorize your emails into different buckets. But yeah, this would be the like a super manual basic workflow in highwood. But of course, apart from it, you can do a lot of other things as well. But I wanted to understand if so far it makes sense or not.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Yes, that does make sense. And that does look to be the kind of tool that, I was looking for. So thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's great. So what I will suggest Jenny like since you're looking to implement this around January, there are two options, right? We have a free trial as well that we give to our clients which goes for seven days, right? Either you can do the free trial now connect one of your shared mailboxes, see how it's working, or we can reconnect at that time when you are looking to sort of implement it because this is something which is more of like it keeps changing, right? The tool keeps changing weeks on weeks. What you're seeing today, you'll see upgraded version when you'll come back in two months as well. So either we can connect at that time, I can help you with the setup with the trial and we can do all of those things and right away do the implementation or if you want, you can do the trial now and then hold for a month or so and then implement it. What do you think?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  So I think I will wait until near… the time in case.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  It doesn't quite work as I or, my team doesn't quite work as I'm thinking it's going to. So, yes, I think it would be as well to wait until everyone is here. I'm also being completely transparent, reviewing another piece of software, another tool tomorrow. So I wish to compare them just to see how they work. So I have a decision to make about which way to go. I have a couple of questions though if I could, if I could ask that… is it presumably completely web based? So you can access it from that web address anywhere or is it an app that you need to have, on your laptop or phone?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's a great question. It's a web based itself. So you'll have to go into that URL, and then you'll be able to use it. We have a mobile application as well. So you can download that and manage this from your mobile as well. So we have an application for mobile, but we don't have it for your, you know, computer, yes go to the browser, yeah.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  And that's fine. So if I was away and didn't have access to my normal laptop, I could still log on.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Through my AI.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  And what was the other question? So regarding the setup and how would you call it integration or something? How you connect everything together? What is involved? Is it something that you and I would walk through? Will I need to get my it support team involved? How complicated is it?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, it's very simple. I think the setup part is something that we can achieve in probably 10 to 15 minutes. It's that simple and straightforward to connect with hiver. I can only help you with that. So, and you don't have to involve your it team unless we need to give certain permissions for outlook or Microsoft to allow permissions to hiver to sort of, you know, get that access. That would be a one time effort in the starting from your it team if it's required. Otherwise, from there, I think it's just a very normal and quick process that I can help you with. And we do have 24 seven support available. So once we have set up everything you have gotten started with using it, if you have any questions, our support team is going to be available through and through?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Okay. And so once it's sort of set up with hiver, is my old outlook account. In effect null and void. I could do it all through hiver and does the outlook account get updated? So as emails are sent or deleted, does that get mirrored in outlook or would you just sort of disregard the sort of outlook inbox portal and just refer to hiver for sort of email history, et cetera.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes. So your outlook will remain as it is because hiver is getting configured or copying or syncing your emails from outlook. So outlook is always going to be the original source for getting all the emails or, you know, replying to those. So all the emails will remain as it is there. You can work in hiver. First of all, you cannot delete any email because it's a shared environment. So we don't want some sort of deleting emails getting deleted for all the users. So that's why we have disabled the delete option in hiver.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But yeah, everything will remain as it is in your outlook in case you do not log into outlook anymore and just relying on hiver, your emails will keep getting synced in your outlook. So you can still see there as to whatever is happening. It's just that the hiver functionalities are going to remain in hiver. So if you're marking email as open, you're creating a tag, you're assigning it, you're creating automation. So doing anything, those will not be reflected in your… outlook, those emails will be just marked as unread. Right? And when you open the email, you can see the entire conversation and see all those threads there. So everything is going to remain in your outlook. Yeah.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  And any replies that we send to emails won't appear in outlook as a sent email. It'll only be through hiver. Is that correct?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Of course. Yes. Yeah.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Okay. Right. I understand. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, I think that was the end of my question. So I think that was a really useful overview. I'm certainly interested in using it moving forward.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let's connect in January then. Would you mind telling me which other tool you're evaluating at this point so that I would also.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Yeah. What was it called? Let me check my calendar. It's in for tomorrow. I can't remember it was in the beginning with jelly.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Something I think it was called hang on.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. If you don't remember it that's fine. We can connect in January. Would you mind putting… sort of a placeholder for January? Yes.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Yeah. I mean, do you want to either just schedule a call or an email just to give me a contact to see how things are going?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, if we could just keep a placeholder sort of for scheduled meeting, I will follow up of course, at that time to see where we are in terms of the progress and if you would still like to connect, but if we could have a placeholder for let's say sixth January, which is a Tuesday?

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Yeah, yes, let me just check.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It would be like exactly two months from now.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Yeah, yeah, that should be fine. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So let me do that and then I'll have my team to connect with you to follow up in case there's any change. And then accordingly, we can, you know, take this evaluation forward. Yeah, lovely. Perfect. Then, Jenny. Thank you so much for joining in and yeah, have a great rest of the day.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. It was very interesting.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Bye bye.

Jenny Lewis (info@jaywolfe.co.uk):
  Bye bye. Thank you.
