Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Jason.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Hello?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How are you?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Good.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice. I appreciate, you know, hopping on the call here today.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Yes, thanks. I appreciate you coming on early. I have my, and then this is my colleague Sam as well.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So just to set, you know, a quick agenda to you, would love to start with a quick round of introductions, you know, understand your role. Okay? What got you interested in hiver? Then we can jump into a product demonstration, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Great.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. But I can introduce myself first. My name is colt miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I've been in the email management, customer experience space for about six years now, and yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can help you all today.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Cool. Great. Okay. So you want me to go now?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that'd be perfect. All.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Right. I am Jason Gordon, and I guess I am I'm vice president here at Mayer malbin, we are a pvf wholesaler in New York City. So we run a warehouse and we sell pipes, valves and fittings out of our warehouse to be mostly New York City customers. And we run on G suite currently. And yeah, we're getting a, what are you looking for? It was all blurry. Oh, yeah. Sorry, we're we live and die in G suite all day. We get a lot of volume of email. We're looking for something to help us triage and track and stuff better than we are, because there's a lot of problems that we have, but we'll get into that later. And then you can go what's up? I'm Sam, I'm Jason's cousin, I'm the CEO.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So just to understand further, like how you're managing emails today? So you have like Google groups shared inboxes that you're managing across the organization. Like what does that look like today?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. So basically we have a, as I said, we run on G suite. We have a Google group for email, the office email address, which you might as well just call that the sales email address. That's where all the customer inquiries come in, quotes, orders, that kind of stuff. It's a Google. It's a Google group that is delivered. Nobody looks at it on the web. It's all delivered to the inbox. And we have about 10 people who get it. And because, we have a combination of, I guess you would call it like managers and then inside salespeople. So Sam and I would be part of the manager group. There's about five of those. And then there's about five inside salespeople. Anybody can answer these emails. And the way we kind of coordinate is we use reply all and it's… not a perfect system. There's some problems with it. For example, like… well, first of all, so everybody on the team knows who's working on what you have to reply all and say basically like, you know, got it or will quote or thank you or something, you know, that's our indication that we're working on it. So the customer gets that email. And then sometimes, you know, because sometimes there's like a race condition and everybody, a couple of people reply all at once. And then, so that causes problems because then the two people that replied have to sort it out between themselves of like who's going to actually do it? And then the customer is getting extra emails and then let's see the other issue is when we're on the BCC. Then sometimes if you, when you're on the BCC and you reply all it doesn't include office. So then that means that whoever replies all to that, it goes back to the customer. And then nobody knows who's working on it. So you actually have to remember when it, when you're on when office is on the BCC. You got to remember to bring it to the CC or the two when you reply. So all in all that sucks, we have no statistics of how, what our response times are, how fast you know, things get closed. It's harder to keep track of open things. It means everybody's just constantly cleaning their inbox with all these office emails even if they never even touched the email. So it's just, you know, it's an issue. So we're I, we're looking for something that can help us, do, you know, manage a lot of this and, you know, get a statistic so that we can like run. So we can have statistics for the inside sales people because they're you know, bonused and things like that could depend on how productive they are, and this actually gives us a way to measure it. So, is that enough?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For you? Yeah, yeah, no, that was really helpful. I appreciate that rundown. Yeah, sure. Is it just that it's the one main mailbox today?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Yeah. I mean, we have, don't get me wrong, we use plenty of Google groups for other things too, but like that's the one where we need the help. So like that's the main one. I mean, we have like Google groups for like, you know, we have internal mailing list, Google groups we have like, you know, we also have ones for ap, Ar, you know, those like that, but the traffic on those is nowhere near as much as the basically this office one. So we just need help with the office one mostly now, if the product's great, we might use it on other things as well. So, okay. But let's start with the office one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. So, I'll hop into a product demonstration here. Just give you a demo of hiver. This is a very standard case for us.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  All right. One other thing before you get started, one other thing that I've… about half of our staff is of the boomer generation, so they're not good with tech, so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  We need something that they can handle.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. I think this is as good as it gets when it comes to that cause like, you know, what's nice about us? We are a certified Google partner, right? We live within that workspace. We're keeping everything in Gmail. We're just adding some additional functionality on top for tracking collaboration and organization.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Let's check it out.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All right, sweet. But taking a look at my screen here, you know, what's nice about hiver is very easy to get up and running takes about five minutes to download. And we can, you know, kick off your team in about a week in terms of setting up the automations rules, folders, that might be. So, you know, about week implementation. And then on the left hand side is going to be one your personal inbox up top. So, this is all my personal email communications. And then below are the shared inbox communications that we have as an organization. Okay? So taking a look at the support share mailbox when I click into it, it's gonna open up sub views beneath it, that helps us manage the intake. So, the first is the unassigned section, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be distributed or signed. The next is mine, everything that's been assigned to me. And then there's the team view. So just understanding from a manager's perspective, you know, what is the team working on in real time? What's outstanding and what needs to be completed?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Where are the closed ones?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that's it's in these all views right here. So if you click into all views that opens up other folders as well as customized folders as well.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. Wait, you can roll that down on the right. Is that what you're saying?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  It didn't go though.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I don't know why it's not rolling down right now. Oh, I need to relaunch my, there's an update that's why I need to relaunch this. I just can't relaunch my browser right now. It's just going to make me reset everything. Okay? But yeah, it's because I have an update right now that I just need to do, but essentially, yeah, you would hit this and then, oh, there we go. Perfect.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Oh, I see it actually flew out from the left.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So, and then these views pop up.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. There it is closed.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, open pending closed overdue. You can create custom statuses, custom views.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. Cool. Got it. All right. Continue.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then go into the unassigned section, right? The goals have unassigned zero. There's a couple of different ways we can route the work. The first way is manually. So in this case, I'll assign it to myself. The next way we can assign work is a round Robin automation that will equally distribute the conversations as they come in. And then the last way is like skill based routing. So identifying, you know, keywords or phrases in the subject line or in the body of text… maybe identify which domains or clients are reaching out and making sure the right person is getting forwarded that communication.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay, cool.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  How would that ideally work in your world team? Just curious, would you want more of a skill based approach round Robin?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  You know, I think, I'm not totally sure. I think either we're going to, I think either we're going to manually do it or we're going to… make some rules. I don't see us round robbing though. I don't think that's going to work. I think we will either like make rules to assign certain customers so to speak to somebody or we'll just manually assign it or let basically support representatives as you would call them or we call them inside sales grab as they're free. You know what I mean?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. Okay. Yeah, you can do, you can do a combination of skill based routing and just, you know, people grabbing what comes in. So it can.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Definitely. Will you call it skill based routing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So think about like if a billing request comes in, right? We've identified it's a billing or invoice request. Yeah, you can sign that. It's like the billing expert.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Yeah, whether it's oh, okay. I see. So that's their skill. Okay, fair enough.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  So, you basically would have one mass company inbox, and then it automatically sorts it based on the inquiry like a major customer service inbox. Well, look, they have different ones. I think they're saying, I think he's saying that if a billing issue happens to come into the support inbox, you can have it go to the right person.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because some people have just general emails, that kind of catch all inquiries. So they like they want to use us to further like triage and route it. Yeah, some people have dedicated apar inboxes, so it just kind of depends right on how the client's doing it tonight.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Right. Which we do as well. Yeah, but well, we'll get into the billing later. But, okay… cool. So what's next?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then we have the statuses so, you know, tracking whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring emails aren't slipping between the cracks.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Adding those tags for organizational purposes, custom fields for further drilling down into data, collecting, data, reporting on it and viewing it.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Just helping you maybe track where something is in progress. What's the stage of the conversation, what needs to be done, things of that nature, maybe a follow up date, and then like the collaboration aspect. So being able to collaborate internally. So, I'll send this note to matt, right? He'll receive that note right up top right here. He'll come to this conversation, maybe he'll use our AI summarizer to get like up to speed on the conversation really quickly. He can see the AI sentiment analysis of the client to understand how they're feeling. You can also use our AI sentiment analysis to escalate conversations to team members.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Awesome. In other words, you can write rules for that, like if it's like if the sentiment is bad, you know, escalate to a manager or something like that.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And let's say we need more, you know, we need more information, right? We're communicating over here, but, you know, we just need more information that we don't have. We do have an AI co pilot as well that can draft replies by sources that we feed it.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Huh.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then, you know, I'm going to, you know, request verification of billing contacts and invoice samples.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  and then I can just insert this into the draft for further editing, maybe create like a shared draft or something like that for the team to work on?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. I see there's a linked conversations. How does that work?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So that's for conversations like, you know, are related and you want to be able to easily jump back and forth between them. So if they're somewhat important to know that they're tied together.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. So that's like for something where, because normally all the, you know, Gmail will thread everything proper, you know, it'll keep the thread as one big. Oh, the conversation is one big thread. Basically, you know what I mean? It stacks all the emails, but you're saying if there's something completely unrelated like with a totally different subject line that Gmail wouldn't normally include, you can basically link to.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  It exactly. Can.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  I ask you a question about the use case of that. Yeah, because I think I see what you're saying. Let's say that a customer calls in a customer requests a quote on an item. Okay? And we don't have it in stock. So we have to go to the manufacturer and get price and availability. So we would, what we would do is we would write back to the customer, say, you know, we'll get price and availability and get back to you. And then we'll write another email to the manufacturer asking for price and availability. Could we link that email to the customer one?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So linking that new email that customer reached out about that new thread?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  No, no, no, no. What I'm saying is a customer asks us for a quote, and then we have to go and email a manufacturer to get the quote. And obviously, we would like to link the email that we, you know, the conversation we have with the manufacturer to the customer? Yes?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes, that is 100 percent a possibility.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. Because that would be really convenient because sometimes like when, you know, when we're looking, when you're trying to answer these quotes, then you got to go search for the conversation you had with the manufacturer, switch back to it. It's a real pain that could be helpful.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. 100 percent. You just have to find the thread, you know, add it, link it together. Then you can kind of bounce back and forth between those two.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Nice. Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And then I know you mentioned analytics too. We do have some great analytics that'll give you some insights. So let's say we want to take a look at the last 90 days of data. We're taking a look at the support share mailbox. In this case here, we can see active new resolve conversations over the time period. You know, what that workload was. We can see what our average first response time was as a group, our average resolution time. So, some of those key performance metrics to ensure you're providing a good experience, efficient experience. And then user metrics. So how many emails have been assigned per user? How many emails have been sent out per user? And then their individual performance metrics below? Like what was my average first response time? And what was like my average resolution time over the last 90 days?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Nice.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Is there any other reports that y'all would be looking for that I could maybe touch on while we're in the analytics?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Any thoughts on that?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Does it do like customer sentiment after further closed cases?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, 100 percent. So we can take a look at the sentiment analysis over that time period. You know, how many negative conversations do we have very negative neutral, so on and so forth? And then you can actually click into these and drill down to see why they were negative.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay… cool. Can we as managers flag email conversations that maybe that we found that the representative made a mistake and maybe the customer, like… we like, can we just add on top like our sentiment about a conversation? Like if we want to flag it as a good or a negative thing, but maybe that wasn't captured by the AI?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, from like your employee's perspective, if they sent a bad message?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Like if they sent, a customer said, hey, do you have this? And our representative said, no, sorry, we don't and the customer's like, okay, thanks anyway. And it's a perfectly pleasant conversation. But the manager could look at that from above and be like… dude, look, we do have that, what are you doing? Like you messed that up, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah. So, that is not something we can do today. This is primarily just to identify the language and tonality of the client.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. But I don't think that's what he's asking. Yeah, it's not, he understands that what he understands that's not what I'm asking.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, I know, we just can't do that today. That's that's not what we can do with it.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  You can't analyze that here, but more what I wanted to know or at least what I think he's asking, is there a way for a manager who sees that to tag or label that particular email like, you know, so, so and so messed up, but without that user being able to see it, I guess, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yes. Yeah, that's not something because you have to apply either a tag that's visible for everyone, you have to either leverage a custom field for that. Okay? Like it's just that.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Stuff's visible at all levels is what you're saying?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  But you could tag it, you could tag it like you could tag it like Jimmy fucked up. I mean, he'll see it, but like, so what I mean?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Good learning experience?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Yeah. Okay. Anyway, that, that's a minor thing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. And then the tag report. So just seeing like, you know, active new resolve conversations based on tags and what are the hot topics we're getting from that mailbox?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay, cool.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And I know we are coming up on nine minutes here. So just a couple other things I wanted to touch on. So getting into the shared inbox settings themselves. So this is where we're gonna manage the support shared mailbox. So who has like access to it? This is just the general round Robin, auto assignment that we can switch on or off… those custom fields. You know, we have four fields. We can create it's. Either the dropdown fields, date range fields, text box fields, or value fields to view data, take action on it, report on it and search on it. So this can be one where it's like, you know, email priority.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Yeah. So you're saying and that'll bring it in so you can set this for every email basically, yep.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So this will be like default fields on the emails. Okay? I don't think we're.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  gonna use too much of that because I don't think we wanna make it. We don't wanna make the interface too clogged up.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, for sure. And you can always start slow and then add those on later as you iterate, just something that we have as you scale.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. Is there, I have a couple of questions. I don't know if you do, Sam, I just wanna know how the copper integration works. Yeah. No, I definitely am gonna ask that, but is there anything else you wanna show us? Because if you have a hard stop at nine, I wanna make sure we ask some questions.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Cool. Yeah. So whatever questions you have, we can run through?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. So… there's are you gonna, I just wanna make sure that you're gonna continue to develop the hiver Gmail plugin? Because I know there's an Omni, this whole Omni thing.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Is there, is there any plan? You're not gonna stop making the Gmail plugin, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, no, this is like our bread and butter. This is what our company was founded on. Okay? There's no intention of stopping developing this, okay?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  All right. And he wanted to know about how the copper plugin, we use copper as the CRM, you'd like to know how that would work?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Let me, so it gives us the ability to pull in information and I believe we can also trigger actions out into copper. Let's see.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I don't think I have it enabled in this demo, but let's just pull this up.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Yeah. I don't the biggest problem we have in copper right now is like we'll create quote follow up opportunities on quotes, but it will, you know, that opportunity in copper will be linked to, the contact and the customer, but not to a particular email chain or a particular quote. So, each of those opportunities gets totally clogged up with like our daily conversations, not necessarily about the specific quote, but if there would be a way to link from hiver to copper, like a particular email?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you wanted to be able to link like records from copper onto that particular email that's associated with it?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Yeah, I want to say like this email chain is what this pipeline opportunity is all about. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. That's exactly what we can do. So current capabilities, our copper integration enables you to view copper opportunity records on the hiver agent panel. So in that right hand panel, we were showing, so giving you that access to the information without switching applications, see person details associated with their conversations, and we can also use direct links to open up these records into copper if you need to quickly hop back in the CRM. Okay. And then some things that are coming soon are being able to create and update copper records directly from hiver, edit copper data from the interface and stuff like that.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  So, right now, we're able to edit copper data from Gmail. Are we going to lose that? Because you don't have the inter?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No, because that's just their native plugin, right? That's yeah, what?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Does the screen look like when we have copper and hiver, do we just like select like which right panel we want to open at that time? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'll show you just because I have the Salesforce integration on this one, just not the copper. So it looked like this, but with copper data.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  And then how do you switch back and forth?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Like this?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Oh, okay. So there's like many there's icons at the top? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  This is our hiver. Yeah.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. Cool. We don't have that now. No. Is that something that hiver built or is that a Gmail thing when you have multiple panel things?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  This is hiver native. Okay?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Yeah, that's hiver. Okay. Let me ask some more questions here. Can you show me how the conversation like how the chats like sort of show with the emails? Like not like the separate ones but like the chats about a particular email, I think it's yeah, it's in that section somewhere.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Like the note section. Yeah.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  I guess basically, and you said if you at mention somebody, it's going to add to their bell at the top?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's correct. So it'll be sent to the notification panel.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. Got it. Is there any other, is there any way to bubble that up higher or more aggressively? I see there's a gear tab there.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we can choose what notifications we get and you can choose if you want like sound notifications or not. But like there'll be like a pretty glance there'll be like a big number up here. When you get notifications, it's like pretty apparent.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. All right. That's that's good. They don't the chats don't show in line with the emails. Do, they only show on the right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Only on the right hand side, Rex, we just don't want to confuse people that it's like, you know, the email in the middle, you want to keep it separate from it.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  All right. I kind of get that. Let's see… how do you handle like especially if you have auto assignments and somebody's out of office?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, we have availability in and out of office settings, so you can schedule yourself from office, away, team availability and like stuff like that?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  And then what happens if, so, let's what happens if you've scheduled yourself away, what you.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  can tab people off too. So they're not, they can't be assigned to anything. So like if I do this to crum, he won't be assigned to anything while he's away.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  But what happens if there's an automation to assign like a particular customer to crum?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then it will go to the unassigned section.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay, perfect. That, that, that's good. And, and we can do this to people who forget to do it for themselves basically. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent. This is a admin access that you can control.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Awesome. Okay. And then, is there any way on the left? I'm sorry, on the copper, not the copper, the hiver panel. Is there any way to like bubble up information about a customer? Like maybe customer preferences or something like that. So, like when we get an email from a customer, the preferences are like right there?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Preferences.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Like in other words, I mean, I don't mean, I mean, like our preference, like we put notes like basically, they're notes, yeah, they're customer notes, basically, it would help whoever's answering it, like know what kind of material to give the customer?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you can create notifications where it's like or automations, where it's like let's see here.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Say new conversation received?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Look at this shit.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And, you know, it's from an email that contains any of like at walmart. Com.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Then let's add the action, you know, send, add… a note with like specific instructions.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. I mentioned to notify user. Yeah, that's awesome.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, you'll add mention someone's name and be like, hey, this, you know, when this client reaches out provide this or whatever, but.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Like where would that? Okay? Let's say you put a note and you just said like customer likes apollo, right? If let's say that was your note, right? Where would that show up?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  In that note section that we were reviewing before?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  So, every email that comes in, it would basically tag that note right to it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  That's pretty cool. So we could do stuff. We could use that in your customer preferences. All right, amazing. And.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I know we are at time here as well. I do have a hard stop just for pricing. So, how many users would y'all, need?

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  I think we would start with 10.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  10. Okay. So the difference in plans and I'll send you this, you can review the, you know, limitations and features that come with each. But essentially, the growth gives you up to three shared mailboxes, 15 automations that you can create, gives you service level agreements, custom fields, customer portal, and these other features below, right? And then the pro gives you five shared mailboxes, 20 automations. You can make for the mailbox, and then csat surveys business hours, and some of these other features. And then the elite plan gives you unlimited mailboxes, unlimited features. You'll get the custom objects which we can route based on data from the CRM, we can do individual to share mailbox automation, skill based routing, and then custom roles and stuff like that.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. What if I have more questions? You know, that before I sign up?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, just shoot me over, you know, shoot me over an email. Happy to answer anything you have. I'll send you this pricing page so you can review it as well to ensure that you're moving forward with the proper plan.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Okay. I mean, yeah, I definitely have some further questions and I'd like to know, and I want to ask questions about like what help we get, setting this up. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And you, so you'll actually get a customer success manager for implementation and team training. So it'll be a totally guided experience.

Jason Gordon (jason@mayermalbin.com):
  Amazing. All right. Well, this is great.
