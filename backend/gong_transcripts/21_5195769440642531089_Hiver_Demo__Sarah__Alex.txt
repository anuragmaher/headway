Phone Caller #1:
  Well, thanks so much for meeting with me. I, one of my clients. So, I own a virtual assistant company and I have a 1,000,000,000 inboxes that I manage. And one of my clients has me on their hiver for one of them, like to how they run their company, they use hiver. And so anyway, I'm using it through them. And I was like, well, I'll just sign up for an account, but now I've signed up for an account and I, it's not working the way it's working for her. And I don't know why, but for example, like this is the inbox that I'm needing to manage, right? And if I go in here like this, I closed this. So it's in, I closed it, but it's still sitting in the inbox. And on hers, when I close something, it closes it like it's got like it archives it out of the inbox. Okay? And in terms of how, from your main inbox, how's that different than this? Like Support on the left hand rail, it's the same thing? Great. So, if you go to Support. So within… the main inbox that you're looking in before?

Phone Caller #2:

And I don't know why, but for example, like this is the inbox that I'm needing to manage, right? And if I go in here like this, I closed this. So it's in, I closed it, but it's still sitting in the inbox and on hers. When I close something, it closes it like it's got like it archives it out of the inbox. Okay. And in terms of how, from your main inbox, how's that different than this? Like Support on the left hand rail, it's the same thing. Great. So if you go to Support, so within the main inbox that you're looking in… before. So this is just going to be all emails that belong to you as a whole. Yeah, that belong to this inbox. Yes. Yeah. If I guess like this inbox, is this like a support at, or is this just your general inbox? This is support at. Okay. Great. So every like everything in support at will still live in this one inbox view because they're writing to support at. Ah, but so this is actually where we can be helpful. Do you have a different email address that you're primarily signed into that you would like to see support at emails?

Phone Caller #1:
  So, this is just going to be all emails that belong to you as a whole. Yeah, that belonged to this inbox. Yes. Yeah, if I guess like this inbox, is this like a support at, or is this just your general inbox? This is support at. Okay. Great. So every like everything in support at will still live in this one inbox view because they're writing to support at. Ah. But so this is actually where we can be helpful. Do you have a different email address that you're primarily signed into that you would like to see support at emails? Yes. But here's the thing is the client sees this email. So if they see a bunch of junk in here that hasn't been addressed, they're going to freak out thinking we're not doing our job. So, my goal as a manager of the inbox was to say, I can close things from my main inbox, I can just come over here and be like, okay, we don't need this anymore and I don't have to log into 50 inboxes a day. I could just log into mine and I see it over here but it would reflect the changes for the client here as well. Yeah, the way that hiver works is that the client would also need a login to hiver, which is probably why your other client had added you. Yeah. So this client or like this support inbox is a user for this obviously, but I see because it is the support inbox that we're managing, then it would stay here. Okay. Yeah. So it's like the view that you have here is, you know, the lower view of the inbox like… that one… that's where you want to be like managing all of these pieces out of.

Phone Caller #2:
  yes. But here's the thing is the client sees this email. So if they see a bunch of junk in here that hasn't been addressed, they're going to freak out thinking we're not doing our job.

Phone Caller #1:
  All right. Is there a way to have it automatically move stuff?

Phone Caller #2:
  All right. Is there a way to have it automatically move stuff?

Phone Caller #1:
  Out of the inbox and into unassigned or assigned to a team member? It could, it could automatically be assigned to support. So how.

Phone Caller #2:
  out of the inbox and into unassigned or assigned to a team member, it could automatically be assigned to support. So how?

Phone Caller #1:
  Yes. So it should automate all new messages should automatically go into this, support. If they're writing into this email address. Okay? We can also do it there's like a historic cleanup as well. I don't know if you saw that button earlier to like sync everything at one point? Yeah, I don't know that I want to do that. Okay? But I'm like how does it skip this piece and just go straight here? I guess I could. So it's like everything in parallel goes there.

Phone Caller #2:
  Yes. So it should automate all new messages should automatically go into this Support. If they're writing into this email address. Okay, we can also do it there's like a historic cleanup as well. I don't know if you saw that button earlier to like sync everything at one point. Yeah, I don't know that I want to do that. Okay? But I'm like how does it skip this piece and just go straight here? I guess I could. So it's like everything in parallel goes there.

Phone Caller #1:
  So, let me give you a different example of how people use this. So imagine you're in your main Google inbox, like your main account, not this like support app that you've logged into right now.

Phone Caller #2:
  So let me give you a different example of how people use this. So imagine you're in your main Google inbox, like your main account, not this like support app that you've logged into. Right now… we can then bring in Support and any other inboxes into your main inbox into your other account. So that way you can see all of your inbox, all of these various email addresses under one account, right?

Phone Caller #1:
  We can then bring in Support and any other inboxes into your main inbox into your other account. So that way you can see all of your inbox, all of these various email addresses under one account, right?

Phone Caller #2:
  But if I'm cleaning it out, they're not gonna see it over here.

Phone Caller #1:
  But if I'm cleaning it out, they're not gonna see it over here.

Phone Caller #2:
  No, they won't.

Phone Caller #1:
  No, they won't. Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, it was worth a shot for sure. Yeah, I'm sorry that, that's not how it works.

Phone Caller #2:
  Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, it was worth a shot for sure. Yeah, I'm sorry that, that's not how it works.

Phone Caller #1:
  Just curious which other client do we share in common billboards, etc. So this is theirs. I was working with the support team earlier, but like if I assign it to this or whatever, let me get it out of there. So people know, but then I just hit close, yep. And then it's gone out of here. Yeah, it's because if you toggle over to the right that Google icon, the billboards, yeah, if you click on that. So your admin at, and then if we click on this unassigned or go to one of the team ones or any of them.

So your admin at, and then if we click on this unassigned or go to one of the team ones or any of them.

Phone Caller #1:
  It's going to the info, exactly. Okay. So the info is essentially what the inbox is receiving and the inbox could receive info support and multiple things in one inbox.

Phone Caller #2:
  It's going to the info, exactly. Okay. So the info is essentially the, what the inbox is receiving and the inbox could receive info support and multiple things in one inbox.

Phone Caller #1:
  And then if it's assigned to you, it's gonna show up in the general inbox as well, like what you're looking at right here because we essentially wanna show you all personal emails plus things that are assigned to you.

Phone Caller #2:
  And then if it's assigned to you, it's going to show up in the general inbox as well, like what you're looking at right here because we essentially want to show you all personal emails plus things that are assigned to you. Okay. Got it. Yeah. So I'm sorry, it's not more helpful at this time. No, it's good. I'm almost wondering if I just set up a generic. So like if I, for example, I'm… just trying to find a workaround. I feel like there has to be something here. So like, for example, let's do this one. This is thread cart. It's in the inbox, right? And it's open. So if I archived it from here, does?

Phone Caller #1:
  Okay. Got it. Yeah. So I'm sorry, it's not more helpful at this time. No, it's good. I'm almost wondering if I just set up a generic. So like if I, for example, I'm… just trying to find a workaround. I feel like there has to be something here. So like for example, let's do this one. This is thrivecart. It's in the inbox, right? And it's open. So if I archived it from here, does… it close it? No. So it would still be here to work off of essentially, it just wouldn't be in the inbox, correct? So if I turned on a rule that says anything to support archive and just works mainly out of this, is that gonna mess up like Google's algorithm and then cause like a junk or anything, do you know any of that? No, it shouldn't at all actually. And there's actually one setting that you need to set up?

Phone Caller #2:
  It close it. No. So it would still be here to work off of essentially just wouldn't be in the inbox, correct? So if I turned on a rule that says anything to support archive and just works mainly out of this, is that going to mess up like Google's algorithm and then cause like a junk or anything? Do you know any of that? No, it shouldn't at all actually. And there's actually one setting that you need to set up?

Phone Caller #1:
  So from the gear icon?

Phone Caller #2:
  So from the gear icon?

Phone Caller #1:
  Yep. And then accounts?

Phone Caller #2:
  Yep. And then accounts.

Phone Caller #1:
  And then it's this one actually. So reply from the same email address the message was sent to. So that's what billboards com has. So when someone writes to info, it gets replied to from info.

Phone Caller #2:
  And then it's this one actually. So reply from the same email address the message was sent to. So that's what billboards com has. So when someone writes to info, it gets replied to from info. Okay.

Phone Caller #1:
  Okay. Yeah. And when you set up that first inbox, I'm sure Google sent you an automated email that you had to like click accept to like be able to send mail as?

Phone Caller #2:
  Yeah. And when you set up that first inbox, I'm sure Google sent you an automated email that you had to like click accept to like be able to send mail as.

Phone Caller #1:
  Yeah, I don't remember, but I think there's like a, yeah, something like you can check all permissions was what it did. It didn't give me a prompt to say send as great. But I'm assuming if I come over here and I go to an email in this other inbox for example, and I hit reply.

Phone Caller #2:
  Yeah, I don't remember, but I think there's like a, yeah, something like you can check all permissions was what it did. It didn't give me a prompt to say send as great. But I'm assuming if I come over here and I go to an email in this other inbox for example, and I hit reply.

Phone Caller #1:
  Let's see.

Phone Caller #2:
  Let's see. How do I do this again? Is it you're in the right spot, but.

Phone Caller #1:
  how do I do this again? Is it you're in the right spot? Keep clicking in that top rail, maybe click like the ccbcc?

Phone Caller #2:
  Keep clicking in that top rail, maybe click like the ccbcc?

Phone Caller #1:
  You know what? You only?

Phone Caller #2:
  You know what? You only you?

Phone Caller #1:
  This domain only has support at set up, I think, yeah, but it's saying it's coming from me.

Phone Caller #2:
  This, this domain only has support at set up, I think, yeah, but it's so it's coming from me.

Phone Caller #1:
  Is this the one that we just did the setting? No. Okay. This is my Sarah at diverse. Let's check the same settings that we just did. Okay.

Phone Caller #2:
  Is this the one that we just did, the setting? No. Okay. Let's check the same settings that we just did. Okay?

Phone Caller #2:
  So, I need to add an email address here. Yeah. So you have to log into that other alias.

Phone Caller #1:
  So, I need to add an email address here. Yeah. So you have to log into that other alias. Oh, that's not it.

Phone Caller #2:
  Oh, that's not it.

Phone Caller #1:

Phone Caller #2:

Phone Caller #1:
  Okay.

Phone Caller #2:
  Okay.

Phone Caller #2:
  I guess it's not going to let us.

Phone Caller #1:
  I guess it's not going to let us, so, yeah, that's kind of that's okay. Yeah, they're.

Phone Caller #2:
  that's OK. Yeah.

Phone Caller #1:
  All right. Well, we tried, right? We did try it. Well, that's the big thing. So the only thing is setting up that the sender as, and then you can come create a custom signature. So it'll say it's coming from, you know, Sarah and you can have like Sarah and then like the underscore of their company name. So it's like kind of a more one to one signature instead of just feeling like it's coming from like generic support. So that's one thing. Okay? And then your other piece being able to like auto archive pieces.

Phone Caller #2:
  All right. Well, we tried, right? We did try it. Well, that's the big thing. So the only thing is setting up that the sender as, and then you can come create a custom signature. So it'll say it's coming from, you know, Sarah and you can have like Sarah and then like the underscore of their company name. So it's like kind of a more one to one signature instead of just feeling like it's coming from like generic support. So that's one thing. And then your other piece being able to like auto archive pieces… you can definitely do that. That's not going to mess up the Google algorithm.

Phone Caller #1:
  You can definitely do that. That's not going to mess up the Google algorithm.

Phone Caller #1:
  We could also set up automations to close out any like spam that's coming into these inboxes. So like if you're getting like stripe notifications or some sort of just notification email that you're always closing, we can edit that accordingly. Okay. All right. I think I've I think it's just maybe not the best fit for what I'm looking for. So I'm going to keep looking, but thank you so much. Of course, it's always worth a shot.
