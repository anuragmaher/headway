Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  this?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Awesome. And are you using Gmail today? Yeah.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Okay. We currently have like a Gmail like workspace. You know, we have Gmail has like hosts, our domain emails or whatever. Oh.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. So taking a look at my screen here, right? Jordan, you know, what's nice about hiver and our differentiator off the bat is that we are built within the Google workspace. So we're going to help you manage those shared inboxes, you know, all in one place. So you'll log in with your normal work email. And on the left, you'll see my personal inbox up top and then below the shared inboxes, right? Customer support, operations info, healthcare, finance, these are different shared inboxes that I've created within hiver.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Okay. And.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Clicking into the support one, right? When you do it's going to open up sub views beneath it, that helps us manage the intake. So the first is the unassigned section, new emails that need to be distributed. The next is mine, everything that I'm working on, I need to complete. And then the team view, you know, what's everyone working on in real time within the shared mailbox, what's outstanding, and what needs to be completed across the team? Okay. So going into the unassigned, right? I've been assigned this conversation right here. I'm going to click into it and a hiver tab is going to open up on the right hand side. And right from the get go, I can understand, you know, the client has a neutral sentiment analysis through our AI, and it's also a billing and feedback request that was also tagged through our AI capability. So right off the bat, I'm understanding what this conversation is about and I have the ability to assign it to myself. And as you know, I'm going to follow up this communication.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Okay. And then,

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  along with that, right, we give that ability to track the status whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks. We're working through a resolution custom fields to further organize and slice and dice those conversations in our views. And we can also report on this in our analytics as well. But let's say, you know, I need more information. I'm not sure how to respond to this specific request. I'm just going to scroll down and at mention a teammate of mine to get him involved in the conversation. So I'll send matt a notification. He'll receive that notification up top right here. Click on it. It'll take him to this thread where we'll keep having this back and forth conversation on how we want to respond. You know, maybe he'll use like our AI summarizer to get up to speed on the conversation really quickly. But let's say like still, like I've spoke with matt in the notes section here. I still need a little more information. I do have a co pilot where I can generate replies as well. Okay? Leveraging the data that we feed it. So if you have internal documents resources that we can feed our co pilot, it can actually pull from it to help your team generate responses more effectively. Okay. So then I'm going to insert this into the draft. And if I deem this is good, I'm going to then send and close that conversation. I'm changing the status you know, from open to closed. And then we're moving on to, you know, that next email communication. Okay? But just want to pause right here. What are your thoughts on this so far?

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  So far, this is roughly what we're looking for. I mean we're looking to be able to, yeah like manage all of those shared inboxes. If we have all of our instructor like individual emails, will we be able to have? Like, I guess more control over those, see what emails are being sent and received like that kind of thing?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  If you create it from a shared mailbox perspective, yes. Okay. If you create a separate mailbox, you can see everything that's coming to those emails. Okay. And.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Then… let's say we were going to make like, you know, we have like a training at email where basically all of our class kind of questions and such goes to that email. If we were to use that email, but then create like aliases with all of our instructors, because currently we have like, you know, Jordan at and, you know, for all of the like, you know, like, you know, like, you know… we would like to be able to like create aliases for those instead of individual emails. Would our instructors then sign in to Gmail with like, would… they have to sign in with their like, sorry… like training at email rather than their like name at email? So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  They would all need to log in with their name at email. So we can like assign conversations accordingly. People can work through them like they'd still need their personal emails with the company to log in and use hiver?

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Okay. And then we.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  also have those analytics, right? So, is there anything from an analytics perspective that you would be looking to glean in further?

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  No, not too much, like because like our primary business is, you know, teaching classes and operations on the property we don't use like we don't send out. We don't like, you know, have to, we don't do packages. We don't like have stuff where people are like, you know, we don't do online stuff typically. So, most of the questions that are coming in and out of ours are like for classes, the occasional, like how do I sign up for this stuff online? And whatnot?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  If that makes sense. Yeah. So we just have some good like, ballpark metrics, where you can see like active new resolve conversations, and over a time period like the volume, what our average first response time was, our average resolution time?

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Okay.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Individual user metrics. So emails assigned per user email sent out per user. And then people's individual performance metrics below.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Okay. And then this.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  One's really helpful, just tags like, why are people reaching out? What are the hot topics we're seeing across the mailboxes and the conversations we're seeing like maybe we can use this to identify ways to streamline certain things, provide feedback and so on and so forth.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Okay. Yeah. So, I think.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Those would be like the most like relevant since like you're just looking for a baseline, these will like typically do for our clients. And then just the admin panel, right? Where we're going to set up the platform, our AI email inboxes, automations, integrations. So, as you can see, I go to share mailboxes, and then all those things that we saw on the bottom left, are these different emails right here, right? Support at hiver, help desk, finance at hiver help desk, so on. And so forth, this is where we're managing those different addresses.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Okay. And then when.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  you click into it, right? Is where we can actually have the menu around it to create automations, you know, autoresponders and all that good stuff. Okay. Yep. But that's pretty much the main things I wanted to cover today. Jordan. We also do offer a free trial and that's what I typically recommend for a next step. So, just kind of from our conversation today, is that something you think you would be interested in getting set up?

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Yeah. Is that something that I can set up on my own? Or is that something that like you guys can only set up so you?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Can set it up on your own?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We typically like to offer up a trial setup call just to kind of guide you through like the steps and process typically takes like 30 minutes? Okay. Do you have some time like tomorrow or later this week that might work for you for like 30 minutes?

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Yes, I have some time later this week. I think tomorrow, I'm fairly booked. What. Oh, I also wanted to ask like, do you have, can you do chats? Or is it just the mentions thing? Like, can you create like a chat between like us and another employee? Or is it all specifically through like the notes and mentions? So it's.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  all through the notes and mentions, is where we'll have internal conversations. You can use Google chat if you want to create, just, like the typical like, you know, like message back and forth type vibe, right? But the conversations on the tickets themselves or emails will be in the notes section. Okay. And are you based out of est, Jordan?

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  About out of what?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Eastern Standard Time? Oh,

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  we're in Pacific Standard Time. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, it's this was for 12 30 for you. So, how would… let's see? When would the morning work for you on Friday? I'm pretty open during your morning.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Yeah, but I'll be honest, I'm typically, I would rather sign up and play with it myself. Like… I can usually figure out these systems.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Pretty.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Quickly. So I think I would rather just sign up and then play with it and figure out if it's going to work, because we're currently looking at two other options as well. So that'll just give me more time to kind of make that decision quickly, cause I think by Friday, we ideally will already have made our decision.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, happy, I could send you that link to like you can literally just go on our website and do that. Okay? That'd be great to the chat right here. So, yeah, if you just go to that link, I just said in the zoom chat, you can sign up for a free trial right there. Would it be cool just to have like a feedback call on Friday? Maybe answer any questions you might have in the morning? Sure. Okay. So, I'll just schedule some time for nine 30 am your time, if that works? Yeah. Okay, cool. So, I'll just send that over. Also send over some other helpful information like setup guides as you get up and running. Okay. But I appreciate, you know, the time today, looking forward to seeing, you know, the progress on Friday and I'll be in touch with that other information after this.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Okay. Yeah, that sounds great. Awesome.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Thank you, Jordan. I will, I'll talk to you on Friday. Hope you have a happy new year.

Jordan Biggs (jordan@runwilddogsports.com):
  Thanks so much, you too. Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Bye bye.
