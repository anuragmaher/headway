================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  hi Kelly.

Kelli:
  Hello. How are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi, good evening. How are you doing?

Kelli:
  Good. How are you? This is Michael very well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you so much. I believe we have got Michael with us. Yes. Hey, nice to meet you. And thank you for booking a quick demonstration with us. Let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Rakesh and I take care of sales at hiver for the european territory as well as some bit of the Australia and New Zealand as well. So I'll be your point of contact for the call today. We'll try and understand what exactly you guys are looking at and if this is a good solution, we'll let you know towards the end of the conversation.

Kelli:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right now, before we begin, do you want to tell me what were you searching for that prompted you on hiver website?

Kelli:
  Yeah. Okay. So we've… watched a few walkthroughs actually of hiver and it has some aspects… that are really interesting to us. So, we have about three or four people using email every day. Okay? I'm the, I spend a lot of time just sorting through emails and answering them to make it easy for my other staff members to see what they have to do.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Kelli:
  Which is very painful. So I said to Michael the other day, I said, you know what? We don't need something as heavy duty as Salesforce, but surely there's something that's suitable for a small business like us that can help us be more efficient. So then we found you guys pretty quickly. So there's wanting to assign emails to staff.

Kelli:
  We also have a pretty massive Google spreadsheet going which tracks either missing stock incoming from suppliers and also damaged goods that we want to get credit for from suppliers before we refund our customers and follow up on and follow up on. And we have a fairly, we spend a lot of time putting all this information in a Google spreadsheet with what's being done. And I think I saw one of the features of hiver was that you can assign ticket numbers in there. So we would have all of that assigned in an email and then be able to just close it once we've got the resolution from the manufacturer.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Okay. So basically, we're looking at a solution to manage these emails coming in today and you want to make sure that the right sort of emails can be delegated to your team. And if these are supposed to be worked by, you can probably assign it to yourself. And these emails should have a ticket number, so that in future somebody wants to refer to those ticket numbers, you should have that readily available data. So basically, you're doing manually all of that, but you want to make sure there is a system that does give you a transparency visibility and a team collaboration. And at the end of the day, you don't want to miss on any of those emails.

Kelli:
  Yeah. Okay. And we also had an issue. I don't know if you can solve this one. We had an issue with the previous staff member. When we went away for a month. She was actually just deleting emails rather than replying to them.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. Does that mean that you're missing on these emails? If we are deliberately deleting it?

Kelli:
  Yeah, yeah. I see. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  How are you recovering those emails then, or were you like in the dark?

Kelli:
  I was in the dark and it was about six months later that I didn't it was six months later before I realized. So we went home on that response.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And how did you get to know that you missed it? Was that a customer request that prompted up or?

Kelli:
  Mixed? It isn't it just a mixture, just some other things she did. And then, yeah. And then I realized. And then if they would see an email the next day, she couldn't find it anywhere.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I see. Okay. All right. Well, these are common problems we solve. Not that I'm hearing these for the first time, I've been solving it for over four years with hiver and obviously, for over a decade within the same domain, you're absolutely right. Having to have a solution is scalable. That is where you would have a lot of operational efficiencies. Now, Kelly, can I understand which is that email inbox where you receive all of these incoming emails today? Like do you have a common inbox today?

Kelli:
  Yeah. It's sales at bnbsupplies. Com. Au. So in that email address, we also have all of our orders from our system drop in there which I probably could sort into a different folder. But I haven't all the eBay orders drop in there… notifications from suppliers that a purchase order has been received, and a notification about out of stock and back order when things are going from our suppliers, and then also all types of customer inquiries, so they can be from a B… to C person wanting to buy one fitted sheet for a special bed to somebody wanting 30,000 dollars worth of sheets and everything in between.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So sales at the rate inbox is the main inbox.

Kelli:
  Yeah, that's where all the disputes come in. Any problems with orders, everything goes in there.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is there any other inbox do you have alongside sales inbox today?

Kelli:
  I have my personal inbox which gets some stuff. Michael, is our accounts. Okay? And I guess he really needs to be involved because he's the one chasing up the credits. Okay? He's part of the system. Got it. And then there's the warehouse manager who despite only being 40 years old has an aversion to computers. So we have to keep it as simple as possible for him. Okay? And then someone downstairs on dispatch is also using the sales inbox all the time to answer questions as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. So apart from yourself, Kelly and Michael, how many other folks are there that require attention to these emails?

Kelli:
  So we would, I think we'd pay a subscription for four.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. So there are two more people who will be essentially working on these sales emails or perhaps you said you've got one more inbox where you receive customer queries or does that also come into sales today?

Kelli:
  It all goes into that. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So there's one main inbox sales at the rate inbox. You have got your own email, Kelly at the rate company domain, Michael has his own inbox, email address. And then you've got two more folks. So basically, we need a solution to manage between these four of us. And at the end of the day, the goal is not to miss on any of those communications. And if any of these users are on a day off, let's say Michael is away, Kelly, you should be aware of how many emails is he working on? If there is any customer requests, vendor requests, supplier requests, you should be able to look at the complete history, the information, and if be a need, you need to be able to delegate it to another person or another representative in your team.

Kelli:
  Yeah, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very clear. Okay. Now, do you want to tell me, is there a specific timeline for you to fix and solve for a solution like this or are you more into a discovery phase and we are okay to live with what we are doing today with the current solution?

Kelli:
  No, we're ready to implement something.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So you're saying this is an important ask for you?

Kelli:
  Yes. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Apart from the email management, is there anything in particular you're looking to solve? Like when I speak to a lot?

Kelli:
  Of, yeah, I don't know if you can. All right. So, I've got two questions. First of all, we have Zendesk live chat on… our website. Do you have a live chat that's not a chatbot that you can use instead of Zendesk?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. We have got a live chat which is a zero coding chat. We don't require technical competencies to it. I can help you with the live chats that are put on your website. Customers can go on your website, chat about xyz, we can even enable the live chat bot wherein let's say, Kelly's offline. Mike is offline. Two other folks are not there, but bot can still answer those queries, and if customer is still adamant to talk to somebody in the team, they can submit the request. And as and when we are online, the very next business day, we can get back to the customer. On ticket. So, we've got live chat. We've got chatbot.

Kelli:
  Are you done?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, go ahead please?

Kelli:
  And I just had another question about the customer knowledge base.

Kelli:
  So, we're answering the same. We get people that come to us and they go, I'm about to start an airbnb. And I find myself constantly emailing on chat and I do have templates set up answering pretty much the same questions. So, does that knowledge base mean that we could have things uploaded that they could access to read?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, you're right? There are two ways to look at it. One is.

Kelli:
  A lot of what we're doing is giving the same advice.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. Yeah, we've got a solution to that as well. You have got knowledge base where you could host your help articles.

Kelli:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let me turn off my video. Can you hear me okay? Now?

Kelli:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Can you hear me? Okay? Now, let me just turn off my video.

Kelli:
  Is this better?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, because I can hear you guys. Okay?

Kelli:
  Very nice to work with you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you guys want to turn off your videos as well so that we could save some bandwidth and we are still connected on audio?

Kelli:
  Thank you Michael.

Kelli:
  All right. I'm kind of stressed though. That's one line.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Guys. Can you hear me okay now?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Can you hear me better is?

Kelli:
  This because people playing computer games, am… I gonna have to disconnect to be able to connect?

Kelli:
  There's a song that you need to sing? I think I have to disconnect first. All right. Come on.

Kelli:
  All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, guys. Can you hear me okay now?

Kelli:
  Yeah, I've connected to my phone.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much. Yeah, I thought if we would turn off the videos that will help us save some bandwidth, but I'm glad we are connected and should you still find any challenges with me hearing? Okay, you can always turn off the video that will help us save some, you know, data.

Kelli:
  You know, I think it's our teenage children carrying the internet on the computer game. So I've changed to my phone now.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. Thank you so much. Thank you. Kali. All right. Well, so we discussed about the live chat with Zendesk, we can absolutely help you with the live chat.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We can help you with the knowledge base. Also. You said, is there a way we could build knowledge base on hiver? Yes, wherein your customers can go ahead, look at the support center, look at the knowledge base articles, try and help themselves in case they still need assistance, they can go talk to the live chat and the same chat can be moderated by the same folks like yourself and the two folks that you have got, and that's pretty much possible. Anything else in particular you're looking to achieve?

Kelli:
  What about connecting with Facebook messages and Instagram messages?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We do not have social media connection at the moment. We don't integrate with Facebook and Instagram for now, but is that very important? Like how many messages do you receive on Instagram or Facebook?

Kelli:
  Mainly mainly Instagram.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, we don't have it at the moment, but that's a project for our next year by quarter one or two, we should be able to go ahead live with the Instagram and Facebook as well. But the most important if you're telling me the emails, the live chats, self help serve on the website, that is all possible with hiver.

Kelli:
  Yeah. Okay. I think the problems with suppliers, they're having a pretty different perspective for tracking.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Very clear. Now, with respect to the volume of emails today, do you want to tell me how many emails do you on an average roughly get in a day?

Kelli:
  So we need to respond to it. It's not just a notification of an order.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sorry, could you repeat that I missed it that we have?

Kelli:
  To respond to probably around 40 to 50?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  A day. Okay. All right. Not a notification. Okay. And is there any reports or analytics you're caring about? Try and find out how many do we get today? How many of them are still open pending closed? Which category of emails do we receive and work on time? Which category of email takes longer than expected? Do you receive these reporting today at any way?

Kelli:
  No, we don't we just use Gmail. And we haven't looked at any reporting on emails at all.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. And with the live chat, you said you have got a Zendesk live chat today?

Kelli:
  Yeah, I think so. Yeah, okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Are you not using Zendesk ticketing by any chance?

Kelli:
  No.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any specific reason as to why you're not using Zendesk?

Kelli:
  We didn't really think about it by itself. Does that mean you have to have that as well as Gmail?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, I'm just curious before you look at a new solution because you're already using Zendesk chat might not. Why don't we use Zendesk as a ticketing?

Kelli:
  Because the two people, our staff members downstairs are very technophobe, they know how to use Gmail. And I wasn't even able to get her onto live chat. She just said I can't learn another software.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I see. Okay.

Kelli:
  It's to be something they're familiar with already.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, basically, you need a solution which is simple to use, very easy. And anybody who is like non technical should be able to work on those requests is what your main requirements are.

Kelli:
  Particularly if they're already familiar with our Gmail inbox, yes, which they are.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Okay. Very clear. Let me quickly tell you what hiver has to do and how we can help you solve all of these problems. Now, Kelly and Michael, do you see that I'm logged in into my Gmail account for my test inbox here?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, I'm logged in into Rakesh at hiver helpdesk. This is my test account. I'm assuming yourself, Michael, all the other two people have their individual Gmail logins?

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We all four of us will log in into Gmail, the individual gmails. We need to install hiver extensions, a little plugin on Google Chrome. And once that is done, anything that you see in yellow sitting on top of my Gmail is pretty much hiver sitting in here. So basically, we are still stuck with Gmail. We are logging into our Gmail individual inboxes, managing our personal emails on the top inbox here. And your actual sales inbox would be something like a shared inbox in hiver. So we will create a shared inbox. Yeah, we will connect it with your existing email, which is sales at the rate your company domain, and all your sales emails will stand to land inside the unassigned brand new folder. So this is going to be your shared inbox for the team. And when we have all four of you logging into Gmail with hiver, you would see the brand new requests in the unassigned. You open the request email, look at what the email is about. The activity panel will help you understand who needs to work on this email. So you can assign email to yourself, your colleague, Michael, or your fourth representative. The status is going to be open by default. And then we need to work on the emails, tag the emails. Let's say this is about a refund request. So you tag a refund request, you want to talk to your colleagues and drop them the note. So you could just do at mention, hey, say, Mike, can you look at this one? So you'll be able to talk to your colleagues right? From the activity panel and this activity panel, the actual activity ticketing panel stays inside your Gmail, your customers, your vendors, your suppliers don't see that you're using any solution at the back end. So for them, it's just sending a sales email. And for you, you're looking at the new emails in the unassigned. And when you look at the mind section, it tells you all the emails Kelly is working on. And when you go to the team section, it tells you all the total emails in open state and your four team members, how many emails that each of us are actually working on. So you see my colleague Yukta is working on seven emails. You've got Mike working on five. You've got Rakesh working on three. And in a case, you mentioned if this Guy takes a day off, and he's still five emails down the line, you could go ahead, select these emails and reassign it to Rakesh because he's available to work on them or you go ahead and assign it to yourself and that's how you could manage the entire transparency between the team members and the management of emails and tickets.

Kelli:
  Yeah. And can you have it? So like I would like to see our staff members' emails, but I don't want them to see mine, my personal like Kelly at BB supplies, because there's management emails in there. So can you set a rule for that?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Could you give me an example here? Maybe?

Kelli:
  I don't know if I was talking to HR about one of the staff members via email, I wouldn't want that to drop in there.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm sorry, I'm kind of missing your voice. Could you repeat that again please?

Kelli:
  Okay. So would just say I had to send an email to HR about an employee, okay from Kelly at BB supplies. Would that inbox be available to all the other people in the group?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, that is you personally sending an email to the HR. So you would just simply compose the email and send an email the way you do that on Gmail today.

Kelli:
  However when they reply that'll only go to me, it won't go into a shared inbox. Is what I'm saying?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Exactly. Now, this is what you're doing personally. So, if you are sending an email to HR personally from your email address, which is Kelly at the rate inbox, it would actually, it would work from your personal inbox. And your other team members won't see this email because that's something that you're doing personally on Gmail. But if you're actually sending an email using your support email address or sales email address, that's when the reply would actually land inside the support or sales inbox for you guys.

Kelli:
  Yeah. What I don't understand though, right? Just say Kevin's away for a few days. I can see that he's got emails and reassign them. Okay? Wouldn't my emails be the same even if they've gone to HR? No?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, you should be able to do that now, if somebody is working on an email and they're on a day off, you could absolutely look at all the emails from the team section here, but if you choose to reply from your email address, all of that would move to your personal inbox. Yes.

Kelli:
  Okay. So if you're sending an email to HR from the one down there called mine, it would be seen by everybody.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, these emails are basically your sales email. So this is the common inbox for everybody. This is going to be your personal inbox. So any conversation you're routing through your personal inbox stays personal to yourself. Meaning you're not even sharing it with Michael unless you open the email and move that email to your shared inbox, you deliberately choose to move that email to a common inbox. And then you want Michael to be a part of it and start to work on those emails or other colleagues in your team. But if you're routing emails, if you're working from your personal inbox that stays private to yourself… is that what you're looking to achieve?

Kelli:
  That's not quite what my question was.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you want to repeat that again? I want to make sure that I understand your query, perfectly. Okay?

Kelli:
  All right. So, I guess the first part of it, so you can try and understand what I'm saying, deb doesn't work on a Thursday, right? We do have an inbox deb at BB supplies, and sometimes customers accidentally reply to that because she's emailed them an invoice. So it comes from her login on our CRM. Okay. So if a customer has replied to her where she doesn't normally get these types of emails and says, hey, can you change my address and it comes on a Thursday? And deb's not there and we have deb set up in this, am I going to see anywhere that deb's received an email that we need to attend to?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. So that is the request which is happening on Wednesday for an example, but that's happening in the personal email account for that representative, right?

Kelli:
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And let's say if that representative is on a day off, you should be able to look at the complete visibility even if they are not in. So basically, you're looking to manage a specific email in the personal inbox of that representative, right?

Kelli:
  But you can set up a hierarchy so that I can manage staff members' personal inboxes but they can't manage mine.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, you can do that in the hiver automation.

Kelli:
  That's the question I was asking.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. I'm sorry, I took a little longer to understand my apologies, but yes, the answer to your question is, yes, through the inbox, let me show you how. Now, when I'm into the automation workflows, I can set up an automation that any email which is coming to that specific representative during a specific time when she's not in or they are not in that needs to be handled by somebody else in the team. Okay. Yeah. So we could do all of that. Let's say there is a new email which is coming in today in your inbox, or if a personal inbox is coming in email coming into the personal inbox of that representative, let me call you.

Kelli:
  You don't that's right? So just so I understand that, that's the functionality that's right? That's what I need to know.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, it is possible to manage personal email for anybody else, but that can still be routed to your common inbox. And then your team should be able to work on that email. You're right?

Kelli:
  Yeah, that's my point.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Apart from that, if you notice new emails will land into your unassigned folder and that's when everybody have access to those emails, the brand new requests, these are going to be the first response, the slas on the emails, whether or not you have worked on these emails in time, these little tags will tell you what these emails are all about. If it's a billing request, it's a feature request, it's a refund request. We can manage the tags from here. Let's say you can create any number of brand new tags for your email categories. And then you want to find out how many refund emails do you have. You don't have to talk to your team. Just search for a tag refund. It will tell you the two emails which are unresolved been assigned to your folks already in the team. If this girl is on a day off, you open the request and put it on your name. And that's how you could pretty much manage the exact workflow of these emails. Now, once you're done with an email, let's say, I'm going to the mind section, I'm working on this email request. I'm replying to my customer. This reply can either grow from your email address or your sales inbox, you've got email templates for all the repetitive nature of queries. I know Rakesh contacted and he joined on January the fourteenth so you could go ahead and use the templates. The repetitive nature of emails, you want to make it more customized, improve the writing. So you could do all of that with the AI. And while you're writing to a customer, you could always say this is a test reply, send an email. Once you're closing the request, you're resolving it, you mark the email closed, and the closed requests will move to the closed bucket. Now, if there is a new reply from the vendor customer on the same email, it again opens up in the minds… that's how you have the entire loop happening. And from the team section, you see total number of requests open for the team. In your case.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any email you choose to keep in pending because you want to work on those emails later, you've got an option to change the status to pending because we know this is a refund request and we want to work on the refunds on Friday. So you can tag the email and keep that in pending emails will actually move to the pending bucket for your team. So that's how you could have a complete management of the emails from within your personal inboxes. So you're all logging into your own individual gmails, still manage your personal emails and your sales emails from the common inbox sale.

Kelli:
  Yeah. Okay. Great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Is this what you're looking to achieve? All in all?

Kelli:
  Yeah. So with my way of dealing with pending in Gmail now is to answer it, but I know I can't forget it. So I schedule a send and send it to myself again at a later date. So pending would be great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And you've got certain follow ups. Also let's say you choose to reply to a customer and you're waiting for their response. It's been two days. They have not responded. You could always trigger a quick notification email to them saying you're waiting for it. So you don't have to manually trigger or write an email to them that can be taken care by hiver itself.

Kelli:
  Okay. Great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. That's how we could actually go ahead and manage your sales inbox amongst everybody. But the only criteria is that all of us are logging into our individual Gmail accounts or we are dragging your sales inbox right inside this mailbox. All right. So we don't have to log in into sales inbox ever in your life. I mean, you can probably log in and check if everything is okay. But essentially in a regular world, you all will log in into your individual gmails and manage your sales inbox and your personal inbox from one screen.

Kelli:
  If that's the case, we need five accounts.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Fair enough. All right. Do you want to tell me when soon do you want to start? And I can help you with the setup and onboarding and of course, bring your team train them and then you can probably make a decision if this is going to be a good solution after you test it?

Kelli:
  Okay. Yeah. All right. Is later this week, okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I can look into my calendar and set you up for a test. So you want to test it on your sales inbox or do you have any other inbox where you want to test that also definitely?

Kelli:
  Sales. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me quickly check the calendar here. Give me a minute.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Are you in Melbourne by any chance?

Kelli:
  Yeah, we are. Okay. Where are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'm located in India, but I do work for the time zones which are quite relevant to the Australia and New Zealand as well.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I've got one meeting at four, but let me check. When can I do tomorrow? Are we okay to look at tomorrow for the setup?

Kelli:
  I've just got a couple of projects I need to finish. So, Thursday or, Friday would be great if you can.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Friday, let me check my calendar for Friday. Yeah, give me a minute. I would check that for Friday. Give me one second, please?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Can we do four 30 on Friday?

Kelli:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me go ahead and send you an invite to set you up on hiver. I've got Michael's email. So let me send an invite to him for four 30 on Friday and I'll call it hiver account setup.

Kelli:
  And then that'll give me the weekend to try and configure it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I will help you set it up, configure everything. All we require is the access to the sales inbox. You both can join. If you want somebody from your team to join me on the call, please feel free to invite them as well. We'll get more ideas about different kind of emails we receive today, different workflows, we require different set of email templates or tags. So feel free to bring in your team as well. So I can even give them a quick training, help them set up.

Kelli:
  No worries.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  As long as you know everything about the use cases and every email that we received today. It should be okay for us to set it up and later next week, if you want, we can even do a complete team training for everybody so that they could log it into hiver and try and see how their day would look like with hiver and they would start using it after they get trained on the platform.

Kelli:
  Yeah, that would be great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Great. So I'm going to send you an invite real quick. If you could please check in your inbox, you should have an email invite. I have Michael's inbox email. So I sent an invite to him already for Friday.

Kelli:
  I have access to his inbox.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, please go ahead and check it.

Kelli:
  Oh, that's the one from an hour ago.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you want me to push it by an hour?

Kelli:
  No, no, no, I've got it. All right. So I'll go, yes… there we go.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Got it. Does this time work good for you both?

Kelli:
  Yeah. So, it's three 30?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Huh. Oh, this is three 30? Okay?

Kelli:
  Yeah, that's fine.

Kelli:
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Do you want me to push it by an hour?

Kelli:
  Yeah, yeah. Actually, it does need to be four 30.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. I'll do that. I've already pushed it by an hour. I'm sorry, this is just a mix up on the calendar.

Kelli:
  Otherwise, it's too hard to get back to work on Friday. All right. I'll be back.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. And apart from that, did you also get a chance to look at the pricing that we offer on our website? Like, do you have any concerns questions around it?

Kelli:
  I think we've assumed we need to do the 49 dollar, okay? Let.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Me explain that to you. Give me one minute. I'll share my screen one more time. We'll go over quick pricing. It's a straightforward by the way, but I'll still explain that to you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. So, we have got plans here, the growth and the pro, basically, the difference here is if we are looking at advanced sort of workflows, where your personal emails have been routed to your shared inbox, sales at the rate inbox. And you require the different business hour templates, like you work nine to five. So any email coming in post five, you want to send a quick reminder that, hey, we'll be online next working day. You want to do customer surveys, like just a quick snippet at the bottom of the email stating how happy you are with the level of support we are doing. For an example, when I'm replying to this customer email, okay. From the sales inbox, when I'm replying to Steve and I have an option here that says something like customer satisfaction, if you notice this inbox with a little snippet, how happy. So you could just track their customer satisfaction. And then even if you're looking to do automations, like any email which is coming into your sales inbox, and you want to basically assign emails to the representative on basis of what the content of the email is. For an example, I'm getting emails. Now, if the email does contain something to do with Uber, com, somebody contacting us, you basically want to route this email to the right representative or if the subject of the email contains xyz as a test. So you basically have all the ways to go ahead action the emails and say assign it to Rakesh because these emails needed to be dealt with a specific representative because these are with a specific subject, the body of the email, or if these email do come from a different suppliers. So you have got automations workflow which are very much in specific to what the email is about. So you can automatically route the emails, assign the emails instead of doing all of the manual delegations. Hiver automatically can take care of all of that for you. Secondly, if you are saying that you have responded to a customer and there is no reply from the email from your customers, let's say for about 24 hours or 48 hours. Okay. I go here and I say time passed since there is no external reply for about two days, let's say for 48 hours, nobody has responded to the email. You have kept that in pending. Deliberately, you could choose to go ahead and send a quick email response to the customer saying, hey, we waited for you. Is there anything else that you require from our end? Wherein Kelly, you are not personally sending an email again, follow up manually. But hiver is automatically, you know, triggering an email response to the same customer who did not respond to us in two hours, two days. So you could go ahead and set up all of these follow ups as well.

Kelli:
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So all of these automation workflows are a part of our pro subscription, which is 45 dollars per login. And if you go monthly, it is 55 dollars and I can do take care of the entire onboarding team training and everything right? From the, from within this package. So essentially, if you are looking at five licenses, that is going to be 45 multiplied by five and that is pretty much it. There is no extra set of calls. There is no.

Kelli:
  Yes, you saw or try and.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It's a per login cost. It's a usd. Yeah. Any, any questions on this? If you don't want advanced requirements, right? If you don't want advanced workflows and everything, I can still see this package looks okay for you, but the advanced functionalities won't happen and it's absolutely your choice and flexibility. You can start with this plan, maybe use it for a month or two and then move on to pro. That again is absolutely fine with us.

Kelli:
  Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Alright. I just want to make sure that you're looking at though.

Kelli:
  If you have five people, do you all have to be on the same plan?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We all need to be on the same plan. We don't have an option to have couple of people on a growth and someone pro. But what I can do is, if you're saying this is good functionality, but we're looking at a little, you know, economical plan. I can look at for the month of November, if I could do 20 percent discount and kind of make it somewhat around 35 dollars for you. I could probably meet in the middle wherein you would still look at growth in pro plan instead of 25. I would just say, you know, let's make it 35 dollars and make it, win for both of us. I'm flexible to look at it. But the important part aspect is let's test it. Let's make sure this works well for you. Pricing is an easy bit for us to sort.

Kelli:
  Yeah. Okay. Alright. So.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  There's an invite already for Friday. Let's go ahead and set it, set you up. First of all, let's give you a complete next week for testing, invite your team train them. And then towards the end of the week, next week, we'll figure out if this is a good solution for you. Don't worry about pricing. We can always negotiate and see what works really well for you. I understand it's a small company, family run business. So don't worry about the cost.

Kelli:
  Alright. Excellent. Alright. Lovely. Thank you so much you're.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  very welcome. Is there anything else that I can be of help to you today?

Kelli:
  No, I don't think so.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Lovely. Catching up with you all. I know this was slightly late today. My calendar was a little packed but we'll connect on Friday a little early. And should you come across any more questions, you've got more doubts. You've got my email address. I'm going to be sending you a thank you note right after this email, so that you have got my address with you. Feel free to write back. We'll be right there for your support.

Kelli:
  Alright. Okay. Thank you so much.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Alright, you're very welcome guys. You take care. Please have a good rest of your day. Bye bye.

Kelli:
  Thank you.
