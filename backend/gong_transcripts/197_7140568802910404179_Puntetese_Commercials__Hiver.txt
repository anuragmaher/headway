Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, OK.

Shrinivas Badri:
  OK. Would you open the email? Sorry, I cut.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Yeah, yeah.

Shrinivas Badri:

Shrinivas Badri:
  Yeah, the message id is in green. You would have to copy that and drop it in our chat window.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  For a moment.

Shrinivas Badri:
  Yeah, sure.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Okay.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  All right.

Shrinivas Badri:
  So, I will investigate on my end. I will consult with the rest of the team and if we have any, I mean, we will have insights to share with you and we will be sure to be in touch via email, OK?

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  OK, perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think we will look into this, but I'm sure. This is achievable, right? There must be some glitch in the back end that it's not letting us trigger this automation at this point. Is that right? Yeah.

Shrinivas Badri:
  And I think I saw an update in the there.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Was something it?

Shrinivas Badri:
  Said remove the conversation?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you click on that email again? Simone? Yeah, it says automation triggered, remove conversation from admin. Okay? So, it worked, right?

Shrinivas Badri:
  It did. Okay. It is taking time. Yeah, it's just taking time if you refresh, probably the email.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Will no longer. Okay. Yeah. So.

Shrinivas Badri:
  It's.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  just to wait some minutes to let the automation work. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And I think it's just because we have set it up right now, but going forward, I don't think it will take that much time but your emails will be removed now, Simone.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Okay. Yeah, maybe because it's the first of the automations to begin in the setup etc. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  But still, we can look into it, but we will check. Okay. So, if it's a normal behavior, and then we can fix that.

Shrinivas Badri:
  Perfect. No, this is completely expected only maybe like I said, maybe because it's like, you know, we've just set it up. So the system probably took some time but two to three minutes here or there is not completely unusual.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Got it. Okay. Padri, I think I'll take it up from here. Thank you so much for joining in.

Shrinivas Badri:
  Yeah, thank you, Simone. Thank.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  You. Bye.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Bye. All right. Cool. Perfect. Okay. Any other question that you might have Simone that I could help?

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  You, with no, no, that's just all, we can proceed with payments and set up all plan.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  We have reduced the number of shared, we have, I know that we have the discount for the other plan, but, we… are… able to reduce the shared mailbox to three.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So, can we look at the pricing plan that we have? Yeah, we can upgrade? Yeah, yeah.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Yeah, great.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  See. So these are the plans that we have, right? Are you looking at a monthly subscription or an annual subscription?

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  For the first month, monthly subscription later, if we all are good, I think we go with an annual subscription?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. No problem. Then I think, you know, since we are looking at three inboxes, and five people, right? We are looking at five users. Is that right?

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, we'll be looking at the growth plan. In that case, Simone, and it's going to cost you for you super month.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Yeah, but, one question with the discount that you propose, last week, it's just for the first month or we can or it's, also for the second third et cetera.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, the discount that we talked about was for the pro plan, right? Because we were looking at five shared mailboxes and, growth plan has a limit of three, right? And usually discounts start from the pro plan because growth is the starter plan that we have.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Right. We,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  don't have any discounts on that, but if you do decide for the pro plan, and, even if you go monthly, the discount is going to be for that month. But if you go for the annual subscription, then the discount will be for the whole year.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Okay. But, for example, if I choose to go with pro for the, for one month and later, we want to do pro annually, we can get the same discount. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  We will make sure we get the same discount. So, don't worry about.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  that, it's… it's better to take pro if the price is the same and there is no reason to go with the growth plan.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because you will get good discount on the pro. So pro, we could easily do like 25 percent off. So, it's going to then cost you about 40 dollars, 41 dollars, to be precise. So, you'll literally be paying only five extra dollars from growth to pro, and then we will retain the same discount for you. So that next month, if you decide to go annual, even on the monthly basis, we will make sure that we give the same discount to you.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Okay. But if I remember good in the mail, you… tell me that was, oh.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  35?

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  35 per user for months.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I see, I'm so sorry, I missed that.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  No, no, no problem. It's, it's okay. Or it's a problem?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Because of course, it's like on a case to case basis. So, now, I can see we did discuss the pro plan at 35 percent off, for the monthly package only, right? So, that was 55 perfect. So, we will enable this only since I've already shared this with you. So it will cost you then 35 dollars per user per month on the pro plan. Okay, same, then it will cost you at the growth pricing only.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  Yeah. In fact, for this, I think that, there is no reason to go with, growth instead of.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Of pro. OK. So, now.

Simone Luinetti (simone@puntetese.com):
  I just do… let.

Shrinivas Badri:
  Me just enable.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  My… side, 35 percent. So this is done. Can you refresh your page once?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
