Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, Srinivas. How are you? How are you doing?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Fine. How are you doing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Well, thank you. Shall we get started with the discussion or expecting more people?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Yeah, you can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. Thank you for scheduling the session today. I'll be helping you with the evaluation. If you could just help me understand what exactly you're looking for and accordingly, then, you know, we can take the.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Conversation. We're exactly looking for a helpdesk solution for managing all the tickets and issues and including customer interaction, customer can also raise the ticket and see his status of his tickets.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So sort of like a customer portal wherein they can see.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Yeah, helpdesk kind of thing.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Is this the first time that you're looking out for a solution? Yes. Got it. And could you help me understand like how you're managing things today? And a little bit about your role as well in the company?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Basically, it's on phone calls and an excel sheet.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. So customers reach out via phone calls. Yeah. And then you maintain the progress and everything through an excel sheet. Yes. Got it. And how many people do we have in this team who are managing this?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  There are five people right now and we are expecting five more people in coming two months.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. In two months, got it. Cool. And since you mentioned phone calls and excel sheet, like do these customers also reach out on any specific email address? Anything happens via email today or?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Not yet. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And is that something that you would like to introduce or would you want to stick to the phone call?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  No, no, not stick to the phone call. We would like to customer log into our portal and raise the ticket so that the help desk agent will see the ticket and respond in the same portal, or he can send us an email, multiple channels, SMS, email, or whatsapp or anything?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And how many customers like what's the volume like per day? How much do you receive on an average in terms of the customer queries?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  On an average, it's almost 100 calls a?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  100 plus. Got it. Anything specific that happened recently that made you sort of look out for a solution? Anything that's not working out in the current process, which is the main trigger for you?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Yeah. Basically, it is very difficult to see and understand by seeing the excel sheet, understanding everything and the current status, getting the current status of an issue. So what are the conversations happened on that same issue or the same customer? Another issue? So like that, some analysis is missing and we have to scroll through the excel sheets and ask the corresponding agent who had called with the customer.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, I can assume how difficult it must be to manage it like so manually today. And are you the one who is heading this team? Could you also tell.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  me, no, I'm not heading that some other is heading and I am taking care of all third party integrations and the tools like this. I'll be evaluating and giving the knowledge after purchasing the tool or onboarding.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And so will there be other people involved as well in the evaluation?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  No, no, no, myself only. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So you'll be the ultimate decision maker. Okay? Got it. Cool. I think I can show you what we have. Just last thing I wanted to understand was in regards to the budget or like I'm sure you must be looking around looking at different platforms in the market, anything specific, which are like the top things for you. And also if you've got a chance to look at the pricing?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Yeah. While browsing through Google, I found your application is integratable to multiple channels, right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It is like what other, what channels are you looking at? Like email is one?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Whatsapp is one and SMS is one?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. We don't have SMS, so the phone is not going to be there. Is that okay?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Okay. Whatsapp whatsapp?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Whatsapp is there, do you have a common number at which you receive?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Yes, we have, we do have the,

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  business. Yeah. So you can connect whatsapp on hiver. So that will help you sort of.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Yeah. Let me know. What are all the channels you have? So once we complete the demo, I can take the decision according to that?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Then let me just take you through the tool. Okay? So this is how it looks like just a quick introduction like hiver sits right on top of the Gmail. So you don't have to really use a separate platform in order to manage all your support communication that's happening today. So you just log into your Gmail, as you do today, have your private inbox here, which will have nothing to do with hiver, hiver's, functionalities are going to be restricted to these yellow colored icons that you see. So these are different folders that you see here, finance healthcare info, support. These are the different shared inboxes. So basically, what we do is we will introduce or you will introduce a generic email address for your support communication, so that customers can write to that email address so that to, you know, sort of reach out to the team. And we will create a shared inbox on that email address. Okay? And that is something that will be created on hiver. And we will add all five people who need to be part of that. So that all of these people now can see the shared inbox from their Gmail account itself, right? And then that's how we will be managing this particular inbox. So this is the email. And then right below it, we have whatsapp here as well. So whatsapp will work this way that we connect this number that you're using and you can handle all the incoming messages that customers are writing to you and multiple people can then, you know, manage those communication. We have live chat as well in case you want to place that on your website or somewhere for the customers or visitors to write to you. And then you can pick it up from here itself. Okay? So these are the channels that we support today. We wouldn't have SMS as part of that. So I'll explain you the email part once in terms of how that works. Okay. Right? So as I clicked on this, these are the sections that will define your day to day workflow. You would have a designated section. So customers can write through two ways. They will either write directly to the email address. Let's say support at the rate your domain or you can create a customer portal for them and give them this link wherein they will log in. Okay, they will log in using their credentials. Okay? And this is another way of how they can sort of… reach out to the team, create anything that they want. Okay. It's not working right now. I'll show you later. Okay. So at the portal, they can raise a ticket, they can submit an issue and it's going to be customizable. So you can have the fields that you want all the information on and that's where they can track as to, you know, whether it's been assigned to an agent or not or what's the status on that. So these are the two ways that customers are going to write to you. Okay? And whenever they do either through a customer portal or directly to this email address, all those new emails are going to come into this section called unassigned. Which means that these are all the unassigned tickets that are sitting here that nobody in the team has started working on. We can either do certain automations in the backend using which either on the basis of this, you know, keywords in the subject or some keywords in the body. If an email is coming from a specific client that probably Yukta is responsible for. We can also directly route those tickets to a specific person in the team, right? So that it's the unassigned section for now, I'll show you manually as to, with this activity panel that you have on the, right? Okay, you can actually then assign tickets to anyone who is part of the set box. So we can actually let's say I assign this to myself. So now this activity will get logged here. So anything that you do everything will have its real time logs for you to then understand who made what changes, who assigned which ticket to who. And once we give the ownership, those tickets will show into their mind section, right? So currently, I'm logged in from my Gmail account, so I can see all my tickets here. So I have 11 open tickets that I need to work on, right? Okay. Collectively for the team transparency, we all can go into the team section here. And this is going to be our central hub which will tell us collectively how many open tickets we have in the team and how these are distributed between different team members. Okay. So that if let's say matt has two tickets that he's working on, I can see what's happening here. I can get a quick summary through an AI summarizer that we have to understand what's happening. If I need to reassign this ticket to myself, I can do that, right? So all of this is super easy to do. And then if let's say he has a lot of tickets and he's out of office, I can easily go ahead here and then reassign those to myself so that we don't miss anything while somebody is not present. Okay. Right? Any questions so far? I'll just take a quick pause here. Okay. Cool. So assignment. And then we have tags as well. So in case you would like to categorize your emails like through excel that you're doing today, I can assume like it must be difficult. So tags are something that you can create in order to segregate different kinds of tickets that you receive on this inbox, right? So that it's easier. Right now, the feedback tag is applied. So I already know without having to go through the email that, okay, this is about a feedback, right? And then you can go into the tags here and can see the entire repository. And if I want to just look at emails related to let's say CDS repairs, which is one of our clients, I can just go and look at all the tickets related to this topic. And these can also be applied automatically through AI. If you let's say, keep applying feedback tag on a specific kind of email repeatedly. Then after a point, AI learns that behavior and it starts applying that tag for you automatically. So this is something you can do. And then from an agent perspective, once the email is assigned to me, there are a couple of things which I can only already see tag is already applied. So I can see on the first glance itself which email is about, what the emojis, these that you see are the AI sentiment that hiver has, which allows you to sort of understand the tonality and the sentiment of each email so that you can prioritize accordingly. If an email is negative, we can create certain automation as well. That if the sentiment is negative that email should be, you know, marked as a high priority, email should automatically be assigned to a specific person. So we can create different kinds of workflows using the sentiment here, right? And then lastly, as an agent, they will also see these like pills like that you see in gray and red. These are basically SLA which you can set at the backend for the team that we want the team to reply or respond to any email that's been written within one hour, right? Or should close that ticket within 24 hours. So we can set up those policy at the backend so that as an agent, I already know I have breached the SLA on these which are red and I still have time, you know, while this is gray. So accordingly, I can prioritize my emails as well.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right now, as I open this ticket while responding, I can either use AI again to sort of either help me drafting a response. So the ask AI that you see here, it is going to be trained on your company resources, whatever you want to feed to AI in terms of your documents PDF notion, anything that you have. Okay, AI will train itself on that. So it's going to work as your personal assistant, where it can either help you drafting the response, reading that email or you can ask any question that you would like in order for you to be more efficient and faster in your responses, right? So that's one or for like standard responses, you can use hiver's repository of templates that you can create for the repetitive sort of response that your team gives on a day to day basis, right? So that instead of typing that response each time, I can just insert the right template, can make changes if I need to by using the AI compose and hit send. Once I do this, I know that my work is done here. I can come here, change the status to either pending. If I'm expecting more response from the other side or I can just close this ticket. Okay? There is nothing else remaining here, right? And those pending ones and the closed ones will sit in these designated sections. Okay? So that if you receive any response from either of these, they will come back into the mind section again so that the person can pick it up. It'll be on top of their inbox… here. Okay. So this is how the normal day to day workflow is going to look like. Last bit would be the collaboration part as well. We can actually exchange notes internally by using the add a note section here. For example, this could be useful when I'm working on an email and I need some help from my colleague. I can just add mention them from here itself and write any message. And we both can converse, Rakesh will receive a notification here. Okay? And we both can actually internally communicate in regards to this ticket which is ongoing. Okay. So, yeah. Any questions so far in terms of the workflow, do you think this is something that could help you? Is?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  There any dashboard consolidated view to see all these? Yeah?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let's go there under analytics. So this is where you'll be able to see the overall performance. Analytics are pretty simple divided into two parameters. One, you will see the workload as to how the mailbox itself is performing, how the traffic is.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And then below, you can see the performance of each person and these reports you can fetch for any specific time period that you're interested in. Let's say, I want to see for last 90 days for last quarter. I can see the report on conversations for each user. Also, I can see separately how your work has been distributed and what's their average response time on these. You have created an SLA for the team. You can actually fetch the report just for your SLA to see how much of the team has been violating those policy, how much of the team has been compliant? And you can further analyze it for each email that we have missed. So, these are the different reports that you will get. And then of course, you can create your own custom reports as well.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Okay. Yeah, right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Any question on this?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  No, okay. Any.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Feedback, do you think, what do you think like as a first impression? Is this something that, that's.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  very good. It's a very simple and very easy to use?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. And it sits on Gmail. So, I think that is something that.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  You.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  don't have to really turn into a typical heavy loaded ticketing tool yet you are able to do everything.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  So, will it be on the hiver domain or this… is gonna?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Work on your Gmail, you will just download the hiver extension. Okay? That's.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  how it'll work on our all Gmail account?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Right. Yes, it'll be sitting on top of your Gmail. So it'll work with an extension? Good. Yeah, we do have a trial as well in case you would like to try that currently, since you don't have, if.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  You can share me the trial credentials. I'll do that definitely.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can just go to just… type hiver Chrome extension, and that's it. I'll be able to then just download it, have it on your Gmail. And then you can start the trial.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, sure. Right.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do you want me to show you the pricing as well? Yes. Okay. So, we have different tiers of pricing and you can see here, we have a free plan. Then we have growth pro elite. Okay? Since you need whatsapp as well, whatsapp is part of the pro plan. And with that, since we need the SLA, since all of that is gonna be in analytics. Also, most of it is in the pro plan which… cost 65 dollars per user per month… that's how it looks like in terms of the cost. Yeah… perfect. Any question for me? No, nothing.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Nothing. It's fair enough. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What do you suggest as the next step from here? How would you like to take this ahead?

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Yeah. Let me check the, let me install the extension, my email and check it. I'll come back once I complete the thing. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Perfect. Then I'll share the details with you over the email, and whenever you're ready or if you want to take this forward, let me know and then we can reconnect and I can help you further from there. Definitely, definitely. Perfect. All right, Srinivas, thank you so.

Srinivas M (srinivas@risurgetech.in):
  Much. Thank you so much. No worries.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Bye.
