Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  hello?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Hi, Iker. How are you doing?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  I'm doing fine. Sorry, Rakesh, I couldn't message you a few minutes. I ran a few minutes late because I had lots of back to back meetings. How are you? How is everything?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Very well, sir, no complaints at all. It's Friday and yeah, thank you for joining in.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  It's Friday. But… Friday also, how can I say starts at… another period with Monday? So I get it big difference. So, Rakesh, thank you for coming. Let me explain and introduce myself a bit. I was working in insider previously and I was overseeing their global support and global customer onboarding operations and a few more departments. Now, I have a joint app here recently, and I… have a team not big as insider, but also we… have different clients in different regions and we have two main business… models. One is ad and the other one is enterprise solutions. So I want to understand what hiver does, if we can use it for level… one and level two support with customer request initiation. So it is the brief introduction.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Yeah, thank you so much, sir. Let me also quickly introduce myself. I'm Rakesh and I take care of sales at hiver for the european territory and somewhere in the Asia pacific. So I will be the point of contact, run the show today. I've been with the company for over four years, personally onboarded more than 500 clients a lot from the support state standpoint. I've had so many support teams using hiver already to kind of organize the emails, work from within the interface, deflect the emails, respond, resolve to these custom queries, and obviously help you triage, if these are level one, support two three routed to the relevant people having to have AI on top of it to help you organize things much better without a lot of manual intervention. So that's what we do on top of everything. Let me also understand Iker with given in your support team. Do you have a solution today that helps you manage these emails today? Or how are you currently working on these requests coming in from your customers? Yeah, yeah.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Let me tell you like we are running a bit old school. You know, we… have a high touch, customer success manager style. So we are basically using our customer success managers to bring the customer request or customer issues to our technical team. So actually we… don't have it. We don't have a tool to centralize or to collect information in the same place.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, is that right? Understanding that whenever your customers contact you, they write an email to the customer support success manager directly.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Email line, call different methods?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  But who like let's say if I'm a customer for app here and I want to contact you guys, where do I write an email? Should I have a customer success manager's? Direct details with me or would that go to a common support at the rate inbox email address?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Yeah, I understand your emphasis on the email. It's because of your probably working model. But let me explain further. We have dedicated customer success managers. So some… number of customers has already me as a customer success manager, for instance. So they are writing to me sometimes an email, sometimes a message, sometimes whatsapp sometimes line. So we don't have only mail. Understood? Sorry, maybe I misunderstood. No worries.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So these are different ways of communication you're saying apart from email, customers also call you, they contact on whatsapp and they text message as well. So I get these are multiple ways to connect. But do you have a shared inbox or are these the personal email inboxes from customers? No?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  No. Personal, personal.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. So these all are the personal inboxes for the customer managers. Yes. All right.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Now, this is because I told you there is no centralized one.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Now, with the given workflow, what are the challenges that you're running today? When I reply or I connect to my customer success manager at your company, they reply back to me with a problem. If a technical answer is needed, they'll keep or probably CC the customer support engineer as well. A technical Guy, right? What's the problem with the given workflow, that you have, what are the challenges today?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Yeah, you know, like it's easily guessable. First, we have a risk of losing valuable information because they are in their personal like… personal?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Boxes. Yeah.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  So this is one risk. Second risk, is there is a lack of micromanagement or lack of micro project management? Let's say, so we are dependent on people to finalize the issue… because if the CSM doesn't close it, then nobody has the discussion with customer. We don't hear customer voice four. We don't get any other extra information from customer directly. All the information is coming from CSM as refined, good or bad.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  And five, we don't have the capabilities of a central tool to use this valuable information later on.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. So, you're saying there is no transparency and visibility because everything is happening through the personal inbox. So there is a very little to no control on what your customer success managers are doing although we are assuming that they're doing best job, but not sure if they're replying in time. If these are, these requests are handled with care or if management has an idea about the reports or analytics because we don't have a central solution. Is what you're saying, right?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Do you want to tell me, do you host emails on Google workspace, or are you a Microsoft company? Okay? So you'll use Gmail today for all of the email processing? Yes. Got it. Now that you have joined the company, you found out this is one of those challenges you want to fix because you want to have one centralized system for scalability, for reporting, for team collaboration, for transparency, everything in a perfect scenario, do you have a timeline on when you're looking to fix this problem and implement a new solution like hiver or any other solution?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  My timeline is, I started exploring some options such as other customer support tools right now. So I want to implement it at last at the end of the first quarter. Okay? But I know it is optimistic everything.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, because it can take some time, but you're saying at least by next quarter, like March 20 26, you should be in a position to say this is the tool that I want to implement for my customer support team.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Exactly.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Now, let me give you a quick information, obviously a quick idea on what hiver does, and then we'll look at if this is a good solution for yourself. So give me one minute. I'm going to be sharing my screen. Okay? Do you see my screen sir?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Yes. All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, basically hiver is an AI powered solution that helps customer support teams with various actions like you said, organization of emails, totally managing these emails, deflecting these emails, where conversations where you don't really need your support, people to work or your customer success managers to work. Even the AI agents can answer those questions on your behalf on AI bit about the company to begin with. We launched back in 2017. We are a series B funded company with over 27,000,000. We have got customers all across the globe, predominantly 50 percent, I mean, 50 plus countries, head offices in the San Jose U.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  S. And we have got certain developers sitting in bangalore, India. We are a team of 200 plus people. At this point in time. I would like to change that. And we work with a variety of customers from different domains if you notice all the way from logistics to technology, financial services. So, we work with small companies which are mom and pop shops all the way to bigger larger organizations like shirtchat, samsara, workflow, flowspace, from technology space, to education. If you see harvard university, New York university, have been using hiver to help their operations, their customer support and other success teams work absolutely efficiently right inside the Gmail inbox. So basically, what we help customers do is we help them organize the emails, organize the call data, obviously, the chats on the website. If it is a whatsapp support, we do provide all of the multichannel, then certain inquiries which are repetitive in nature. Hiver, AI can help you deflect those, respond on your agent's behalf. If that is a generic email or you have certain knowledge sources through which you can respond, resolve. And obviously, at the end of the day, you're optimizing the entire customer support and success flow with the AI tool like hiver on top of Gmail. Now, what I would love to do is instead of going through all of these, I would rather quickly log in into my Gmail screen and I'll show you how hiver functions and take all your questions as well. Okay. Give me one minute. I am going to be logging in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, if you notice I am logged in into my Gmail, this is my Gmail account, my personal inbox having hiver running on top of my Google Chrome. So it's a Chrome profile. All right. And if you notice in the support inbox, there are emails. If I were to show you the mind section. So these are the organization of all the emails. And if you notice this says neutral sentiment from a customer, right? This is automatically tagging of emails based on the context of the conversation. Now, these are the auto assignment of tags through AI, which is what is this email about? It's? A backlog. It's a billing request. It's an L1 escalation. So all of these are different tags which hiver applies on basis of the context of the conversation. All right. So every user will simply log in into their Gmail inbox, and all the customer support success managers would look at the emails in the mind section that are assigned to them. And these could be automatically assignments of the conversations. For an example, I opened this one. Up. Now, when I'm looking at this email, you see this email is actually sent to a common inbox, which is support at the rate company domain. So one big aspect to this platform is that you do not currently have a shared email inbox in order to make sure everything is centralized, we first of all, need to have a shared inbox in your Google workspace. Now, instead of routing these emails or any conversation directly to the customer success managers in the personal inbox, we would say the best would be to actually have a common inbox that's where you would have a centralization of every information. Do you think that's possible for you?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  I think it is a bit different than what I expected because this way because my team is customer engineering here. And this way I… don't see a very streamlined way because if it is a shared environment, then maybe I will reply to the same customer at… the same time.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No, it will not happen. That way. I'll tell you why.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Can you show me a bit more?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Now, if you see this inbox, this hiver setup is actually running on personal inbox. So all your customer support engineers will log into their individual gmails. Now, this is a shared inbox setup which is set up using shared email address support at the rate. Now, when I have the new emails coming in, those would go to the unassigned box for us. So unassigned view would be all the emails which are unattended by your customer representatives. Now, automatically, when emails are assigned to people, I would see the emails that are assigned to me in the mind section. So nobody else is going to be working on these emails because these are assigned to me automatically or on basis of what the context of the email is. So I have a very clear defined ownership to the email. Now, if I want to work on any other email from the team section, that's when I'll go and look at how many emails Cole is working on. And from there, I see Cole is already working on four emails. How do you presume that anybody can actually work on these emails? When I'm actually looking into the mind section here? So there won't be a chance that when I'm replying to this email, and I can always reply by the way, using my email address, which is Rakesh at hiver, have my signatures at the bottom. Excuse me, now, if somebody else picked this email up, I would see a notification right on the top here that, hey, Rakesh is already working on this email. So there'll be a collision alert because we predominantly work on basis of ownership. If an email is assigned to a specific representative in your team, nobody else will actually look at that because it clearly says the ownership on the emails in the mind section. And for you look at the team section, there are 27 tickets opened up for the entire team. And you have a clear workload distribution for the team. So, you know, how many engineers are working on what sort of email requests for you. So I'll care about what's happening in my inbox in mind section. But if I need to work or help matt, because matt is on a day off today. I can see matt's requests also. And then from there, I would see this is a neutral sentiment. Customer email is assigned to matt. The first response is yet to happen. We need to reply at least by the twentieth of November. Now, this looks like some export related information. Can I open the request? Look at what hiver has to, I mean, what this customer has to ask, summarize the entire context of the conversation, look coming from Nai, you could? Just simply look at, you know, what the email is about. And from here, I can add mention and say, hey, matt, I will be working on this request. This is just for your information, you take your day off and I can reply to this customer.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  I see. Can we also work like, let me, no, no, one second, let me grasp the previous interface. Sure. The previous one, sorry?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The team section. Yeah, yeah.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Saying the main interface of Gmail?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Yes, yeah, no, no, like, you were in like at the right site, there were a lot of options. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Sure. I opened one of my emails and this activity panel?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  This, can you show me that activity panel? All right. Okay, perfect. So, this is.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  The activity panel?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Okay. We can use text here. Can you add more tag?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, these taggings can be automatically done or can be manually assigned to these emails and you can choose the tags by the way you can create your tags from here. All right. So, if you notice this is feature requests, this is downtime. This is maintenance L1 L, two escalations. And when I'm actually looking at any of those emails, you'll be amazed to see that automatically, hiver can extract the summary here for your ticket. I can use these custom fields, the dropdown priority and you can create more such custom fields for yourself?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  This is good. Let me take some notes for a second.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Okay. So can you one second priority? This is, okay, priority can priority be customizable?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. These are the custom fields by the way, when I take you to the admin control panel at the backend in the support inbox for you under the custom fields.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Can you give me a demo panel so that I can explore?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, we can help you set up your test account and, you can look at all of those. So if you notice the custom field, yes, you can make your choice of custom fields on dropdowns. Then. Yeah, you have date field, when is the next follow up for the customer? Then you have a number field where hiver will automatically extract, you know, the information from any… of those tickets and then there is a text field which can basically help you, Rakesh.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Let me introduce you to. David is our support manager. So also… he is also interested in what hiver does. Maybe you can, if you don't mind, if you can show one more very quickly, happy pet, hiver will catch up because the rest, we already had a conversation.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure, absolutely. Now. Nice to meet you, David. Thank you for joining.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Nice to meet you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Great. Now, David, we were discussing about having to have a centralized solution for managing the customer support. Now, hiver is an AI powered customer support solution which work right from the individual Gmail logins. So we all log in into our own Gmail accounts, run hiver extension on a browser, manage customer phone calls through air call. We have notifications here. I mean you could go ahead and keep yourself available to work on the tickets. You can see the personal emails in the inbox here on the top. And also if you notice the support inbox, we are going to be setting this up with the shared email address which I were talking to Iker that at that moment today, everybody receive emails in the personal inbox, which is not a scalable solution because you cannot control individual inboxes. So when you're looking at streamlining the customer support, you would have to have a shared email address, something like support at yourcompanydomain com that's when we set up a shared inbox, you would have new conversations coming into the unassigned. Given that the AI would help you literally understand what is the sentiment on this email. Hiver automatically tags the email on the resolution time like the SLA is running on it. So brand new requests come into the unassigned that's when you open the request. And hiver can automatically even understand which representative in your team has to deal with this email. For an example, this is something to do with the access control. So it can go get assigned to the cache automatically from hiver. Hiver. Will also help you understand with whether it's a priority email or not. You can use these custom fields ticket summary of the conversation. When you summarize the email, it actually helps you decode what the entire context is like without me going through the email, reading it. Hiver. AI can literally help you understand the exact context of the email. So that's there in the summarization. And when you assign email to a specific representative or it gets auto assigned by hiver workflows in the mind section, I have all my client requests assigned to me. So these are my tickets by the way, these are automatically tags hiver added on basis of the context of the email. These four emails are already out of SLA, we haven't responded to these emails in time. So you have the entire context of all the emails which are assigned to one representative in the mind section. Now, when you go to the team section, you would see the total requests for the entire team. There are set 27 tickets which are assigned to exact workflow distribution in. The team. So you have seven assigned to Rakesh, and you've got so many other emails. So you have visibility on how many emails Cole is working on now, Cole is working on one request, which is billing backlog. All of that is possible to look at the complete view of the team.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Quick question, Rakesh. Sure. We have, as I told you, we have CSM customer success managers, and we have our customer engineering team. So… is there any way that these tickets is escalated? Like, for example, let's assume customer sends an email to the customer success manager. Can they escalate us? Yes, can we do it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Absolutely. Now, let me show you. Let's say this email now escalation, meaning it could either be on high priority or escalation.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Means we are changing the teams. Okay? Keeping the previous information, keeping the previous information, changing the team. But also, I have one more question. If you do it after you do it.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. Go ahead with the question, sir. I'll answer both of these, yes.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  After you escalate it, I don't want, I say, I want to understand when I… reply, who gets the answer? So, is CSM getting the answer or customer getting the answer, right? CSM, customers send the ticket to CSM, CSM, escalate the ticket to me, to ilker. Okay? And I write something to CSM. I am asking, hey, what… is the issue with this customer?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Makes sense. Now, let's say this email is right there. I'm the CSM, I'm managing this email. I got this customer request. Now, when I'm escalating it, I can use a tag and I would say this is escalation… L1 escalation for an example. And my engineering team will actually get this notification.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, when there is a tag added to, it could be assigned or I can just add mention my other engineer and this engineer could be Cole. Let's say Cole would get an email escalation. Fyi. Cole, you need to help me with this one. What Cole can do is Cole can actually either your CSM can assign this ticket to Cole when it is escalated or your CSM can still be the owner of the ticket and Cole can talk to each other. We can have a quick conversation internally in the notes here. Whatever the escalation is about second thing when Cole gets to see this escalation tagged email under fyi note from the bell notification. When Cole is actually looking at the email, Cole can literally summarize the conversation about the escalation. Cole can understand what is the customer asking for, which is why it is escalated. Save this as a note.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  So if I use the notes, if I use the notes, everything will be in notes section is only visible internally. Is it true? Yes, and customer only gets the email back?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yes, customers do not have access to this activity panel. This is for our internal reference.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Okay. That's okay. Now, do you have any questions for this part?

David Li (david.li@appier.com):
  Enough for now? Yeah, maybe we can continue. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, here is the question. Now it is escalated assigned to. Cole is the engineer. L, one. Now, when Cole actually works on this email suggests a reply from the co pilot also or maybe draft some response. Cole can always go ahead and, you know, let's say I'm doing test reply for this escalation. What Cole can do is Cole can actually share the draft with your colleague. So, you see I worked on the escalation request and I just simply saved the draft and I can just simply go ahead and add mention my previous customer support manager, success manager. I would say Rakesh just look and this is where we can have clear collaboration on the drafts shared by each other.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Any… any question, on the internal sharing of drafts?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Yeah, no, we can check the triggers and rules and also notification part. I am interested. And do we have any, for example, effort points here?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Could you explain that? Sorry, I missed the last part.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Let me ask first, is there any customer… information to be located here? Is there any CRM integration, for example, can you integrate to Salesforce? Yeah. Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you use Salesforce today?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Yes.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Inside the integrations, we can turn on the integration with Salesforce. And there's a lot that we can do with the Salesforce integration. I'll show that to you. When you're actually working on a customer request from the app section, your Salesforce integration would be right here. So hiver will automatically fetch the Salesforce information, contact information, see about the customer. What is this customer about? All of that? Perfect.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Perfect. We can move on, perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Now, with regards to the automations, if a Salesforce owner is already present in your CRM, hiver can automatically assign that ticket to that CSM in hiver… so that you don't have to manually choose the ownership, okay? Number two as, and when the emails are escalated, it could be routed to the right set of person and notify on the bell notification on the top. And we can turn on the sound notifications. We can turn on the email notifications as well. For an example, let me show you… when I'm into the support inbox, and I'm looking at the automations, workflow… I'm actually recording this conversation. I could, I mean, if you want, I can share the recording with you. You don't have to make so many manual notes. It's okay. Okay. Now, if there is a negative sentiment, if the customer is escalating things, customer is sounding negative, hiver automatically sends a notification to the right search person. Now, when escalation is done, you can turn, that sentiment is updated and sentiment is negative, customer comment. Or another condition is whenever there is a tag that gets added, which is escalation. L1 escalation, it simply goes ahead and assign the conversation to a specific team member in your team. And also, you can go ahead and add a quick notification. So you want to just add a note to the conversation saying this is an escalation team?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Quick question. Do you have here a Jira integration to connect to that? Like, so, for example, if the CSM creates a ticket and that ticket comes to us, can it immediately when it is assigned to a person, immediately create a Jira ticket in our respective board? Is it possible?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, Jira integration is possible? What I can do is just simply create a ticket in Jira, all right. Look at which project and everything.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  But can you do it automatically?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me quickly check the workflow here. And when you say automatically, you're saying on what, like what is the trigger of automation on Jira?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Like for example, a sign based on recipients? No, no, no. Okay. I received my answer. I received my answer here. You can go back, create automation and here assign based on recipients. So whenever David's team has been assigned, then it will create a Jira ticket automatically.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Let me see the action.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  For now, log an email. Okay, I would have to check if I could turn on the Jira automations here. And if you notice like create a lead in Salesforce here, you're saying it should just log a ticket in Jira automatically?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. You can check it. You can, it is not urgent. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. So basically, on the basis of recipient email, you want hiver to automatically log a ticket in Jira for you?

David Li (david.li@appier.com):
  I have one question. I also see that you can integrate with slack. What is the integration for slack?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So slack integration is basically when you receive emails into your common inboxes, your support, shared mailbox, and you get assigned to a ticket. It can actually notify your slack channel that you have new conversation. You have a new comment. If somebody works on an email and drop you at mentioned note. So basically, these are more for the notifications to let you guys know that there is a new ticket in support. Somebody assigned you a new ticket as in when you're owner of the tickets and somebody at mentioned, if this is escalated tickets, all of those are going to be the notifications in slack, but this would not work if customer raises a slack request and you want to create a ticket out of it.

David Li (david.li@appier.com):
  So it's just the notifications in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Slack, it is the notifications. Yes. Okay. All right. And from here onward, Iker, when you are done with the request resolution, you have notified your customer, you have replied, and obviously, you can ask your customers. They're happy with the level of support or not. So you can have a customer satisfaction survey at the bottom. When you're closing tickets, the closed emails will move to the closed bucket. So these are the resolved emails for your team. And as and when teams are working on the requests, they can put these tickets into pending, so that anybody who is actually looking into the pending section would see what is this email request was about. So you have pending requests, closed requests and all the unassigned requests which are not attended by anybody. And then I would always look into the mind section to work on all these emails today. And from the team section that's how I'm going to be looking at the actual organization of my emails?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  That's okay. These are, okay. Quick question. Do we have any analytics?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Could you tell me what sort of analytics do you want to look at? Like what's on your mind? And what do you want to achieve out?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Of it, for example, how we solve issues… how we give the first response? How much is it? Also? I think first assign time response time? Okay. Can you go and re, resolve? But for example, let's… assume I have sold a ticket, And I have sent the customer an email response. Do I tag it as sold?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You close the status when you're sending replies, you close the status.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  That's okay. Then I close the status and customer gets… back to me. What happens it?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Reopens the email in the mind section. Okay?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  When customer says, thanks, thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Does it reopen? No, the AI will detect thank you note and it will close the ticket for you. Okay?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Good.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's AI detector, thank you detector. But otherwise, if you want to find out reports on Rakesh performance, you would see from the date range. He got 88 emails, only worked upon 24 tickets. This is his performance report.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Okay. Like Rakesh, I think I have… can you also show me the SLA and csat?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure, and other reports? I would you?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Don't have.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  To, yeah, yeah, I will show you a quick glance of SLA. All of these are the first response violations where team has not been able to respond to the emails for the first time in two hours or four hours. Whatever SLA, you set up resolution violations, where we haven't been able to reply and close these tickets in time.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Perfect.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And then is the customer satisfaction, how many customers are dissatisfied from the survey reports we'll be sending? Then you receive the feedback as well, happy, neutral, satisfied customers.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Okay. So you,

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  have all of these quick sentiment analysis, how many of them are negative emails? How many of them are neutral customers, which are positive, very positive. Okay, these are AI driven.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Okay. Thank you. So please tell me about business model and also, we need a demo… account.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. I'll help you with the business model. First of all, could you tell me how many people do you have in your customer success team and engineering team?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Like customer success team, I think we have nearly 50 people… in engineering team. I have two teams. The enterprise one is 25 people, but we will grow at some point… but customer… success type will be like, I think, you know, other products, huh? Like for example, Zendesk, you are very familiar with it. I usually use customer success as like agents. I don't give them any agent responsibility. So now, if we can create a tier one, first tier one support first, it will be three people, what we'll be reporting to David. So I think we will need in the first place, 30, but it can increase gradually because I have, as I told you, I have another team which is also 20 people understood all.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right now, with respect to all the analytics, the automation workflows, everything on AI, as well as the integrations with Salesforce and Jira. We are looking at this elite package for you because anyways, when we are looking at a complete tool for your teams, this is essentially going to be 75 dollars, okay? Per login. So if we are looking at say around 50 people or 30 people. So that's going to be straightforward transparent pricing with no extra setup cost or nothing as such.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So that is 75 per user multiplied by number of users. You can do bill annual or bill monthly as well. So that's going to be the pricing. Apart from that, you will have a dedicated resource to help you set up your account onboard your team and make sure that you are adapted to the platform at the earliest. Now with hiver, it's not a difficult solution. Number one, I mean that you don't have to, I mean you have to set it up today, implement for another two months like Zendesk does. I mean it's a heavy implementation with hiver. It's just a plug and use and, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, straight off work from your Gmail. Now, with respect to the setup on the demo inbox, I would send you a quick guide link on help hiver, you could go ahead and set up hiver just within a couple of minutes. I'll share all of that, but you have to have a shared email inbox. First of all, now, before you start hiver, a test on hiver, you would first of all, create a support at the rate inbox. Only then yourself, you can add David, and multiple teams can actually log in into hiver and work from their personal emails on the top and the shared emails coming into the support inbox from the shared mailbox setup. Now, before you set up hiver, you need to first set up the shared mailbox, yes?

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Yes, yes. I got it. But Rakesh, can I ask one thing I told you? Like we will be, we are trying to be fast but it will take a bit time but you already know that like we are actually adding a new thing to our tech stack. So, can… I have a longer time for your demo? Because David, also, I am also we are very hands on also we have another friend Andy like he couldn't join right now. So we will check it very clearly. It's okay, sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  David, you know what I would recommend Iker at this point in time. And since your timeline is March, so you will be making a decision perhaps towards that point in time. Like of course, in the first quarter of next year now, because hiver is very easy to use solution in about one or two weeks, you will be able to find out if this is a good solution.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Do you want to maybe reconnect when it's a good timeline for you instead of doing tests today? And then again trying it out in the month of March? Do you think connecting again closer to the timelines would make a lot of sense today because then you'll be into the position to make a decision. But today you'll test. And then after three months, you'll again be testing the platform with a lot of other functionalities.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  No, no, no. I mean, let me tell you what I will do first. I will try to set up the shared account, but our organization… I told you like I'm not in FPL, FPL is in taiwan and I think this has some ups and downs mostly ups even you showed me, but I want to negotiate… for budget.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Not only with you, also with my top management… also, I need to show this to people who can also watch for other things because I believe it may be a good one. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It is best used when multiple teams are using and we all are on one central platform.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. I would recommend step number one. You first of all, go ahead, discuss this internally. Okay. I'll share the recording of the meeting. You create a shared mailbox, first of all, in your Google workspace. And then I will send you the details on how to set up the trial. You try that out in parallel. You can always talk to your management and see what budgets do we have for a project like this? I am sure that if we agree on if this is the good solution for you, we can work around on the budgets as well. But at the same time, I want to make sure that this product works well for you and for that, we need to change the approach. We need to first have a mailbox, have a discussion internally, tell management that we're looking at something very easy inside Gmail for hiver. And then in parallel, we can even have a discussion on pricing. If everything looks.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  good for price, we can do less like the first. Things are more important if I have a shared inbox. And if I have a working version of this so that I can show and play with it, implement, etc, I'm.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  happy to explore pricing options for you. That's an easy part.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  Pricing is the last part. Thank you, Rakesh. I am very glad we have met and thank you for your explanations.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you. I'll share all the information.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  I have joined a lot of these calls. I want to give you that. It is one of the best I have ever joined. And thank you for your confidence.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Thank you so very much, sir. I'm glad you enjoy the rest of your day. Let me send you all the information needed right after this call. Thank.

Iker Ayaz (ilker.ayaz@appier.com):
  You all.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. You, take care, bye.
