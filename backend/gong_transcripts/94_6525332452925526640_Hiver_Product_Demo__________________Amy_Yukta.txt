JohnBokiev:
  hello there?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Hi, is this Amy?

JohnBokiev:
  Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, we can't see you, but can you hear us? Yes, I can hear you. Okay, good.

Пользователь Zoom:
  Yeah, it's Amy and both of us from last time.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Hi, hi, Amy.

JohnBokiev:
  Hi, hi.

Пользователь Zoom:
  Did.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I get your name, right? Okay, perfect. Thank you both of you for scheduling this with us today. I know that we had our last conversation regarding the tool, understood how it works and how it would cater to your specific requirements. Did you get a chance to discuss this with your team leader? Like you mentioned in terms of the whatsapp if he's okay with that or if you would only want to evaluate this for email, any update on that? No?

Пользователь Zoom:
  Well, we haven't really had time to give him a full summary yet. We were hoping to test it out ourselves first through the trial and then just give him a full report of everything at once.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. No worries. Then I can help you setting the trial today. If any of you, or since you have joined from onedevice. If you can share your screen, I think I can then walk you through the process and we can get the trial set up.

JohnBokiev:
  Oh, my, I apologize. We are connecting today from iPad, not personal laptop. So, I don't think we can share any screen or work here. It will be, is it okay if we look up from your screen sharing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It wouldn't be possible to do that from my screen. The whole idea of setting up the trial is for me to be able to guide you through the entire process with this screen?

JohnBokiev:
  Really?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So we would then be able to do the trial in the real time. I have a beginners guide as well since we have already gone through the platform. So me sharing the screen would be just another demonstration of the tool that we do want to do. Is it possible for you to move to a laptop or a computer?

JohnBokiev:
  Can you give us two minutes? Let me go and check and ask our team leader for any extra laptop?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can do that. Yeah, in the meantime, I've just shared the link guide in the chat if you see. So this is the beginners guide basically, which will lay down all the steps for you to set up the trial. It's very easy to be honest. All you have to do is download the extension of hiver and add the email address, which email address are we looking to, use here in order to centralize,

Пользователь Zoom:
  That would be a question for her. I'm not too sure. But so, basically, from what it sounds like, we can actually just register for the trial ourselves. If we follow the link.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yes, it'll hardly take you like 10 minutes to do that. You would just my advice that you do it on your laptop or a computer, that's where you would be able to download the extension on your respective Gmail accounts, create the shared inbox on the email address that you would like to manage. And that's it, I think your account will be set up.

Пользователь Zoom:
  Oh, okay. Great. For some reason, I thought that in order to sign up for the trial, we had to book a meeting to.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Set.

Пользователь Zoom:
  it up. Okay. Oh, then actually, that's easier than we thought. Then I can just tell her that we can set it up on our own then.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You can do that. I'm also happy to help you. It's just that we need a screen for me to walk you through it. So if today, it's not possible, what you can do is, you can try this yourself first with the link that I've shared with you, and we can connect again for a quick check in, maybe tomorrow or day after, just to make sure that everything is set up, right? And if it's not, then I can then help you in that call when you have your laptops as well.

JohnBokiev:
  Okay, that.

Пользователь Zoom:
  Sounds good too.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Let's see, let her come back and then we can accordingly decide. Yeah… no worries. Okay?

JohnBokiev:
  On the laptop, let me two minutes, send a link because I thought you will look up the demo from your site?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is it possible for you to join from the laptop itself? Yeah, yeah.

JohnBokiev:
  It, is, it is possible, it will be very quick because here is the whatsapp already open. I'll just resend my, the link that you send us here and join from laptop. Yeah.

Пользователь Zoom:
  Okay. So, then we should disconnect on here first. Okay? And then we'll rejoin on the laptop.

Пользователь Zoom:
  Okay. I'm gonna just disconnect now. Is this the one?

JohnBokiev:
  No, yes. Ah, yeah. Yes, for sure.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you hear us? Yes, I can hear you.

JohnBokiev:
  But I can't hear you by any chance. It's maybe the volume turn up volume? Oh, the volume was off. Yeah. Now, can you hear me? Thank you. Sorry for waiting. Thank you for.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Waiting. Now, if you can share your screen, we can get started.

JohnBokiev:
  Okay.

JohnBokiev:
  Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you would have the share option below.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Share your screen, right? Perfect. I can see your screen now. Can you go to your Gmail once? Okay. Let's not do that. Can you click on your profile? I just want to make sure this is your profile itself on your Google profile on the top, right?

JohnBokiev:
  Yeah, but it might be not mine of our, another person. Okay. Yeah, it's not mine. Would you like my, because I don't think we can use currently the one that we would like to implement the hiver, right? Right?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  That's the one that we should be using, yes.

JohnBokiev:
  But can we use another one for trial? Not that one?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Do you have any other email address?

JohnBokiev:
  Yes, yes, yes, yes, I have, and.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Then, where would you like to share this shared inbox? Which email address do you want to manage eventually?

JohnBokiev:
  One second. I didn't send you any message, right? Bye?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. Is there a reason why you don't want to set this up on your account? No?

JohnBokiev:
  It's not my account, but it's kind of like the, I mean, like it's my account… but for now, we don't want to use for trial, the email where we receive emails from customers. We would like to, for trial one, try another.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Your Gmail is not going to be affected anyway. When you're using hiver, your customers will not get to know or anything like that. But if you have any dummy account on which you would like to do the trial, you can do that as well.

JohnBokiev:
  Okay. Sure. Yeah, it's because we.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  haven't, it will not be on Gmail. Guys. I'm so sorry, Gmail com will not be acceptable. Huh. Gmail com will not work. It has to be a company account.

JohnBokiev:
  Oh, but we don't have company Gmail accounts. Yeah, we don't have any company Gmail accounts.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What I'm trying to say is that Gmail com as a domain will not work. Ideally. The trial is being done on the domain accounts itself. The one which is it, which is mybncglobal. Com. So, this is the email address that's currently with you. And this is where you can install the hiver extension and have hiver trial going on. This will not affect your current Gmail, your current workflow or anything like that. Your customers will not get to know that you're using hiver. So from all those regards, it's nothing. Nothing's going to change in your Gmail when we create the shared inbox, that's what I need to understand which account you would like to manage or convert into a shared inbox. Is this an info at the rate customer support at the rate? Like we discussed the centralized inbox, what is it called? I'm.

JohnBokiev:
  Really sorry, Yukta, English is to be honest, not even my second language. It's my third language. So it's a little bit difficult to understand. Also like speaking a little bit too fast for me. So basically to understand you need company BNC global email, right? Yes, yes. But we have company email each of us, but it doesn't have Gmail. Like, you know, account. It's not connected to Gmail. It's connected only outlook and teams. It doesn't have separate Gmail. This one, it's not mine. It's another person because the laptop is not, it doesn't belong to me at all. So that's why it will be difficult for us now to provide any like sample of emails, email like, yeah, email account. So, yeah, and also using the ones that where we would like to implement the hiver also impossible. So I think only the way it's like showing from your side briefly like how just basically it works overall the hiver.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So this account that you're seeing o, SX at the rate mybncglobal com, this is not a Gmail account. Is it an outlook account?

JohnBokiev:
  This one, this one might be the Gmail account, but it doesn't belong to each of us. It belongs to another person. As the laptop belongs to another person, it's not mine because initially we saw the demo will be proceeded from your side. So, no need. So like sharing screen and showing will be proceeded from your side. As I understood. And my colleague who speaks perfectly English, understood so, but came up that you would like us to show the screen but we have only like we're up to, but we have only the fake, not fake like personal or fake Gmail accounts, which doesn't work for you. So only options, so.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What we can do here is you can just simply use your account, right? The bot at the rate my BNC.

JohnBokiev:
  But I'm saying it doesn't has Gmail. It doesn't has, it doesn't has, it doesn't have, has it doesn't have, it? Doesn't.

Пользователь Zoom:
  have, it is an outlook account? Yeah?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, are you guys like hosted on outlook or are you all hosted on Google workspace?

Пользователь Zoom:
  So, so it's kind of complicated. So, our personal corporate emails are through outlook. However, our customer service email address for the company, the one that we're interested in using hiver for that one is linked to Gmail. Not outlook.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, these email address that I've just mentioned, this is what you have used to book this demo, right? So, can you confirm of these two? Are these outlook accounts or Gmail accounts? These are, did you?

Пользователь Zoom:
  Send it in the chat? The?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Chat? These are outlook accounts, right? Let.

JohnBokiev:
  Me see, because it's still sharing and we don't see the chat, this one, outlook? Yeah, it's something yours. Yeah. Okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Understood. And then, the email address on which you want to centralize the communication, the one that we discussed that multiple people are using, is that a Gmail is, what that is called? Firstly, what's that email address info?

JohnBokiev:
  Accosm. Com, right? Okay.

Пользователь Zoom:
  And.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  this is a different domain also guys ace costs, like, is this a different company or no?

JohnBokiev:
  It's under our company, yeah.

Пользователь Zoom:
  Our company just has different brands, yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay. And is this an outlook account or a Gmail account? Gmail?

JohnBokiev:
  This.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  is Gmail? Yes. Okay. And got it. And… so everyone is logging into this Gmail account and then managing these emails, right? That includes you both. Yes. And there are one more person, I think there are total three people, right? Who are logging into this. Yeah, understood. So we do not have Gmail accounts to do this. Like you wouldn't have your own Gmail accounts. These are like Gmail accounts are like Gmail. Com like Amy at the rate Gmail. Com, right? Yeah. So this is gonna be a little difficult guys because I hope my English is better now, like I try, I'm trying to.

JohnBokiev:
  Make sure.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  that, you know, you understand this. So on hiver, you either have to be on outlook or Gmail, right? Currently, you are like, it's a mix like your individual emails are on outlook and your shared email is on Gmail. And that too with a different domain. So, and with this setup, hiver will not be able to suffice as it will not work with hybrid because hybrid needs, either you are on Google workspace completely or you are on Microsoft completely. Both requires the domain email addresses. So, does that make sense Jimmy?

Пользователь Zoom:
  So, basically, what you're saying is the domain email address need to match in order for all of our team members to log in using their own.

JohnBokiev:
  I mean, even if.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  they didn't match domains, but you have to have a domain account like this bot at the rate o S, at the rate, these are Microsoft outlook accounts, they should have Gmail accounts, then it would have worked or your info at… the rate could have been outlook account, but it's a Gmail account. So that's why it won't work.

Пользователь Zoom:
  Would it work? If so, since our customer service email address is through Gmail? What if we used our personal Gmail accounts? It?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Doesn't work it?

Пользователь Zoom:
  Has to be a company.

JohnBokiev:
  Email address. Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Пользователь Zoom:
  Thank you for the clarification.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. It's quite unfortunate that this couldn't work, but let me know if anything changes internally. If you're planning to move to one email provider completely, I think at that point, we can reconnect and I can help you with the rest of the evaluation.

JohnBokiev:
  Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank.

Пользователь Zoom:
  You.

JohnBokiev:
  yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. Let me know if there is anything else. You can always reach out to me over the email.

JohnBokiev:
  Okay. Thank you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Thank you so much for your time. Take care. Bye, bye. Thank.

JohnBokiev:
  You. Take care. Bye.
