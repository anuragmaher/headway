Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  hi, young. How are you?

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Hi, I'm good. How are you doing?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Well, thank you. Shall we get started with the discussion? Yep, thank you firstly for scheduling this session with us. I'll be helping you with the evaluation. And yeah, if you could just let me understand what exactly you're looking for, so that accordingly, we can take this forward.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Yeah, we just signed on for the trial yesterday and we are not really sure how it works in terms of like making shared emails private again, for example, like if I'm on a team with my boss and I want to share a draft and then send it and then say we get a response, but he wants that to be for him only. And how can we make the thread private? Again? We didn't know how to do that. So we just thought it'd be easier to walk through it with the person.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, are you looking to manage your boss's email account between you two?

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Yeah, I would be like drafting emails on his behalf, and then he would have to like approve them and send it. But… most of the time, like he would probably want the thread to be private after I send it and get a response.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So in that case, I think, you know, hiver may not be the right fit for you because once you create a shared inbox, in hiver, all the emails are shared. So, yeah, I think once you have created a shared inbox, you have invited your boss and you both are part of that shared inbox, you can create drafts on his behalf. But as he's sending the email, that email will stay in the shared inbox itself… unless he split the conversation and then take it, you know, as a private conversation. But I think doing that for every email is not something that would be ideal because that's like for one off conversations that you would like to split a conversation and take it as a private conversation from there on. But more often, for almost every email, I would not suggest, you know, to use hiver because hiver is meant to, you know, be created or managed as a shared inbox or a shared space.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Also, it, would that feature is just unavailable. Yeah, you would want to, I see. So.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Your boss would like to take all, almost all his emails as a private emails, right? Once you have drafted the response. Yeah.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Yeah, like selectively, I think, but yeah, it would be hard to do that for every single one that we have to do.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's not scalable to be very honest. We have that feature. You can split the conversation, but then again, it will not be scalable for him to do that for each email individually.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  I see. So in the case that like he just will share everything with me, could you just walk me through how to use like the shared inbox with like the unassigned? Like I just have a ton of emails in my unassigned for some reason. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, you have already created the shared inbox, right? With your email address, which is young at the rate, right? And you've added your boss as well. So this is how your inbox currently looks like you would have all these emails sitting in the unassigned section. And from there, you would be signing it to either yourself or to your boss. So this is where you will see your name and faces. You can either assign all those emails to yourself if you want or you can assign to him. And then from there, you can draft responses from here, save these as a draft so that he can come look at those emails and then send the response. So this would be the workflow for you. Of course, this is not the typical use case why someone would want to use hiver. But since you want to just have a shared space, I think this is the most features that you would want to use in order to sort of draft these emails, you can keep them in unassigned as well. I think that should be okay since it's just you and him and you can just focus on drafting these responses so that he can come look at these emails, edit it and send the response. The emails are going to remain here itself unless he changes the status to closed. So the emails that he has already worked on that you are no longer expecting a response, or maybe you see an email and you see it's an unactionable email. You don't have to do anything there. You can just simply come here and close that email so that it goes away from the unassigned section here.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Okay. So the unassigned section just means that like it hasn't been dealt with.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Okay.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Okay. So if I assign it to myself, then it'll move to the mine box. Yes, it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Will go into the mine section.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Okay. I see there's like the split conversation feature when you were showing me that, could you explain that for me? This?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Is the split conversation, what happens? Let's say this is the email that I'm currently working on and I would like to split a conversation, which means that I want to take the rest of the conversation outside of this inbox that's where you split a conversation. And from here, this will be a new thread basically with the same person. You'll have to put the subject line and put your email here. So, this is something that, you know, he'll have to do now, from here, any reply that comes… on this email chain will come to me in my private inbox, and they will not be part of the shared inbox.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Oh, okay. So that could work. Maybe, yeah, you?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can check with him. If he's okay doing that, then, yes, he can split conversation and then take it privately.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  So, if we make it, oh yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No, no, go ahead, please. Sorry. Oh.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  No, I was just gonna say if I split it then will it go into like the regular inbox?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it will go into his regular inbox?

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Oh, okay. Yeah. You were saying I was just?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Curious to know like the primary reason why you would want to have the shared inbox created is for you to be able to draft responses for him, is that the primary reason?

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Yeah, to like, yeah, basically draft responses for him? Okay?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  So, basically, just keep the inbox clean since there would be a lot of emails coming in so that you can either close a couple of them or draft a response so that he can just come and look at those and then just take the conversation ahead.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Yeah, like I could just have access to his email, but then we thought that it would have the feature of being able to split it. So, which kind of works, I think that would work?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Yeah. You can do that. So, for all of the emails, like when the email comes in like as original emails in his inbox, you will be able to see those as well. Is there a reason why he would like to only sort of take the conversation privately once the first response has been given… I,

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  think, because like there could be confidential information that he would just want to know for himself. Okay. Yeah, but.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Any email that comes in as the first email, all those emails are going to be visible to you? I hope that is fine with him.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Oh, so the response, so he would have to split it before, yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Anyone who writes at his email address as the first email is always going to land in your shared inbox. Right? So it could,

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  be, oh, every email that he gets is going to be in the shared.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Inbox, every email. Yeah. So, it could be the case that, you know, as the first email itself that's coming into the inbox, that itself is confidential, right? So that would be visible to everyone.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  But then, what about? Yeah, sorry, I keep on interrupting.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  You, no worries. No worries. Please go ahead.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  If he splits it and then they respond to that split, then it.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Will go into the private inbox once the, once you have applied the split conversations from there on, it will no longer be part of the shared inbox, but the original emails which are being written for the first time, they will all land in this inbox itself. Okay? So.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  If he, if he knows that the response will be confidential or have confidential information, then he can just split it and then he can.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Also remove that from the shared inbox.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Oh, yeah. How can he remove it? You just.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Click on these three dots and you can just remove that email.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Oh, okay.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Got it. Yeah. And he can take it up privately as well.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Okay. That's good. I think that's about it. I think.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  The best thing to do is actually to remove only and not use split conversation because anyway, it's his personal inbox. So everything is going to remain in his private inbox as well as it is visible to his shared inbox. So he will see emails at both the places at all times, right? So, rather than, and you can just use this for a drafting… purposes where he can just look at your draft and see if it's fine, and then send the response. Once he sends it, he can just remove that email from the shared inbox.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Oh, okay. Yeah.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Take the rest of the conversation private, yeah.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  That sounds good. I think, are there any other like main features that would be useful for just general for?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Your purpose? I think this should be good. I think keeping a track through status, knowing which email to work on, which email to just close if you want, you can categorize your emails, but I think for this purpose, in terms of the pricing also, you can easily go with the free plan since you just want to use it for the temp, the drafting purposes. So, I think that is part of the free plan itself shared. So, yeah, I think that should be good enough for you to start with.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Okay. Also, if I draft a response and I want him to like check it, is there like a separate folder that I can just, he can just check all my drafts or?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is where you will be able to see all the drafts in one place, right?

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Because, I did make a shared draft and then I, and then I couldn't locate it in that folder. Okay? If that makes sense, or?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  What you can do, this is the feature that we have recently launched. Hence, it says new, what you can do in that case for the time being, if it's not visible in the shared draft, whenever you draft any response, you can also put a note in this section here, so you both can converse also in regards to any email. So, if you want to put something for him, you want to let him know about something. Let's say, could you review this or something like that? You both can actually as well. He will receive a notification and he can actually look at the draft that you have created and he can check it right there and then itself or see your comment?

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  So, is the shared draft feature just like bugging? Do you think?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  It's not bugging. Can you show me what's happening?

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Yeah, I can show it to you. They.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can help you with that.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  I can show you if you let me share my screen. Yeah.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Okay. So this is a really important, so I can just show you. So I sent mine. I sent this like response. And it's shared draft. Okay? But then when I go here, there's nothing.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I think you have to share it with someone.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Can you click on that shared draft there in the mind section, the one that you just showed me? Yeah. Can you edit this?

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Yes.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  And I just press this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  This is because you're not sharing it with someone. The shared draft folder is for the draft that you're sharing with your colleagues as well. So, if you click on the shared draft, you can save this as it is how.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Do I click the shared? How do I share a draft from?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Here below send button? The first one?

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Yeah, just save this.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  And then when you go in, this is saved just for you, right? This is not going to be visible to other people. When you click on shared drafts on the left shared… draft folder, this is where you create a shared draft which is going to be visible to everyone. So, can you just type anything here as… a test? Put in the subject line as well? And also the email address? Or maybe that's not required that's fine. Can you click on shared draft or you can skip the email that's fine. Now, this is where you will be sharing a draft with, you know, whoever you want to share it. And this is where.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  So I can't share a response right away. I have to create it in here. Yeah, if.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  you want to share with someone, then you have to see it here. Otherwise, your drafts that you're putting on any specific emails are going to remain in that email itself. And anyone who wants to see that drop, they have to go into that email manually. And then only they'll be able to see it.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Oh, so we can't draft reply, share drafts on replies?

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  I'm sorry, I can't.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  share a draft of a reply response to someone. Yeah, you.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Cannot share it right away. Yeah, they'll have to come to that email to see it or you can mention it, mention them in the notes section. So when Joseph looks at that email in your mind section that you have, where in the draft is that he will be able to see that draft as well, and then he can edit it and send it right away.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  I see. Yeah… I see. Okay, I think I have everything that I need then. Yeah, perfect.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  Then yang, let me know if you have any questions going forward, I will be sharing some details with you as well over the email. So if in case you have any question, any concern, you can let me know and, you know, I can help you with that or you can reach out to the support as well as they are available. Bye.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  Thank you so much.

Yukta Jain (yukta.j@grexit.com):
  No worries. Thank you for your time. Take care. Bye bye. Thank.

Young Kim (young@vitalrobotics.ai):
  you for your time. Goodbye.
