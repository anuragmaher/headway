================================================================================

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  hi, Matthew. Hey.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Emillie. How you doing?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  I'm good. I have lulu here sitting next to me. We're just like a little out of range.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Well, appreciate you both joining. Yeah. So the agenda for the call today, sorry?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  My son is playing spider man down the hall, so you can hear the hulk smash coming. And I was just like let's make sure we're locked in. Otherwise he'll join this call anyway. Sorry.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Go ahead. No, no problem. I'm working from home too. So my father's in the other room shrieking right now. Whatever he's doing, I'm not sure. So you might hear.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  That as well. Baby hulk smashing, you know, like it could be it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Could be that. Yeah, awesome. Well, perfect. So, yeah, the agenda for the call today really just wanted to make sure that you were set up on your account, see if you had any questions, and then just kind of get you situated there with everything. Does that sound good?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Yeah, that sounds great. And we do have a couple of questions which are probably silly, but hopefully that will you'll be able to answer them quickly. I'm sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Yeah, hopefully. Okay. So, awesome. Got it. So you got you signed up for your account, right? You got let's see one, two, three four people in here right now. Is that right for?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Now, yeah, I have a couple more, I think I need to add.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. I just want to make sure your mailbox is set up. Okay? So you have the shared email address is E at nortoninteriors. Com?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  We're going to have two shared inboxes. I set up the first one just because when I added the growth plan, I didn't realize it limited us to two inboxes but like we really were a really small business, we can't afford like 5,000 dollars a year in five inboxes. That's just not feasible. Part of how hiver came into our workflow is that we lulu's my new like executive assistant and studio manager here. And so part of it was like managing the flow of my inbox because we are an interior design firm. So I just get a lot of messages both from reps, vendors, clients, all of it. So she's kind of like mission control. And some of that was part of what was happening with Gmail. Was like using the filters and read unread because I was so used to using read unread for like my own personal… you know, use case that hiver seemed like a really good solution for like maintaining that line while we transition, but then also being able to do some tagging we're on slack. So then it can also like as we get a little more sophisticated with it, we can do some like pinging in slack which is nice and helpful. And then I think, you know, assigning to team members because a lot of things will come to me but then need to like are actually for someone else to manage, just get delegated out. And then the other shared inbox that we're going to create is going to, I need to create a Google group first, but it will be for like our ordering and procurement process. So there's basically like three emails that'll go out of that, which all have to do with like ordering accounting and… like quotes. So that way it's just like there's a lot of us work out of those inboxes. So I think it'll be a really good use for that inbox to be able because there's so many emails that come through it. So that'll be the other shared inbox, I think that we're going to do.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay, great. Yep, absolutely that, yeah, that could definitely work. And then with the account that you have right now, how's that going? So?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  I think the trickiest thing is we have tried every version of like I've spent weeks on this or like at least a week and several days I cannot for the life of me get promotional emails to stop fucking showing up in our unassigned. And I understand that the next level we can unlock is like it pays to filter Gmail promotions. But like, I know that there's a way to do this. I just don't know how to set the rule and I really need promotional emails to not be in our unassigned.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. And I.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  can share my screen with you or you might already be able to see it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, yeah. If you could share your screen.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Yeah. So, we sort of started moving some of them out but like as a good example here's, a bunch from earlier today that we just hadn't assigned like west elm sale, wildwood, we like your style. And so like they're getting tagged correctly, like they're showing up as fyi, they're in the main inbox, they're getting flagged as like promotional emails in like actual Gmail. I tried deleting all of my filters and reinstating all of like reinstating just the promotional filter, but I don't know how to fix this. And like I actually cannot use hiver if I cannot fix this.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it. So, is it just like that one brand that's emailing?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  You, no, it's all of these woodland direct neon signs now, napa home. So, if you were to go to your, the regular Gmail inbox, those are all under promotions. Yeah, they're all filtering correctly. But once you go to hiver because the way hiver works is anything that hits the inbox, goes into unassigned. What I need to be able to do is say anything that's promotional that hits this promotional thing, just gets assigned to closed that's it. So I.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  was.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  trying to play with a bunch of different, like, you know, I was talking to chatgpt and gemini and trying to like figure out like, so it was like, okay, you could set a rule that says anything that has the words unsubscribe in it. I tried that. It didn't work like I cannot figure out how to get this rule to work. So, I assume a lot of people have this issue and I was just hoping that you could teach us how to make a rule to fix this.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I think we could here. I'm trying to think this. So when.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  I was in shared inbox, I went to here. I went to automations, right? Yep. And so, you know, promotional emails, new conversation body contains any of unsubscribe. And like that's not working, right? Because those are all have, so maybe I'm not, maybe it's like maybe it's that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Does it see? I don't think it says the word unsubscribe in the body of the email… right? It says, it's like an unsubscribe option on the email. No, it.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Is, so, it's actually, I've learned this through this really exciting journey that I'm on. Yeah. So I'll get to take you on this journey, matt. Fantastic. So if you go into a promotional email and you click this and you take show original and you go command F and you go unsub… see it's written a 1,000,000 times.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. Yeah. This is like the back end coding though. I think hiver just pulls from the text on the body of the email.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Unfortunately, which is fine too because the word unsubscribe is right there.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right, right. I'm trying to think here. So basically what's happening, right? Because you're using your personal email as the shared mailbox, is that right?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  It's my work email. It's.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  your work email? Okay. Got it. Because, yeah, most of the use cases for hiver, people are using shared… addresses like support at info at. So they don't get as much promotional emails to them. But I mean.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  As another example, we have like fathom AI, and that should be able to be filtered out. Like we should be able to have basic filters on things. So every day, I probably get 20 zoom invitation alert type things and these all just get filtered out. So we need to be able to like use filters, you know?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. Yeah. So there are automations, like for the zoom one, that one's easier, we can create an automation that says any email that comes in from the domain zoom. Com, you want it to automatically move to the closed status? Okay? Sure.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  But we still have to resolve this or I need to get rid of the program. Unfortunately, like I have to be able to do this. Otherwise it's not going to work for us. Then I've wasted so much time in attempting to automate something that can't work.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'm going to pull someone from my support team to hop on this call and let's see if they, if we can figure something out. Let's see here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And then also in here too, have you ever reached out to our 24 seven support in here at all? We've.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  tried with support several times.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  With hiver support. Yeah. Did you ask this question? What'd they tell you on this one? They're like.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Yeah, you can do it that way but they like didn't help. They didn't facilitate anything.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Oh, okay. Yeah. Because usually they're quite good too. I mean, if you follow up and be like, hey, can you hop on a call and help me with this? They'll hop on a call with you as well. Okay. I'm just trying to get somebody here to join.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Is there also not a way to like hiver doesn't get smart in time? Like isn't it have AI to it too?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah. What are you asking like?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Won't it start to understand what's… in here like when things are sales… emails and stuff like that.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And it's sales emails somewhat, there is something called AI tagging but that is not on the package that you have. Okay, but I don't think it would be, it wouldn't be, it wouldn't resolve this issue for you. Okay?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  It's.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  more like it can recognize certain emails like it can recognize if an email is about a billing issue or if an email is about, you know, things like that, and then it can automatically apply the tags for those and then they can kick off some automations, but I don't think it would be able to recognize if, I don't think it'd be able to recognize promotional emails here. The.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Other problem is now that it's done this, I have hundreds of emails in hiver. So, now, we're like basically fucked to Gmail standards of like cleaning out the hiver inbox, which sucks. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. I see what?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  You're saying, you know what I mean? Like now, it's just like already a mess and we just got the tool, which sucks, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. Let me see here. I'm still going to this person.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  So, I have a question for you. Yeah, I don't my team shouldn't be able to see my inbox except lulu, like she should be the one, but she should be able to assign emails responsi. So, can people have get assigned emails out of my inbox without seeing my inbox? They can, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Anybody who has access to that hiver folder is going to see everything? Okay?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  So, the answer is no, correct. Got it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, yeah. So, so, you know, the most typical use case for people that use hiver is for everyone to have their own personal emails and then to create a separate shared group and connect that to hiver. Yeah, I.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  mean, we can do that in some cases, but this is my primary use case is the Ea use case like it has to work for that. Otherwise, it's useless to my business. Like unfortunately, that's the basis of needing an email sort like we've been fine on filters. Otherwise, it's now the added layer of, having… a administrative person like operating out of my inbox, yeah. Okay. And maybe the answer is that hiver's not the right tool, which is fine. In that case, I just want to refund it and then like look for something that works for our use case better. Yeah, I like the hiver integration options that we had with the rest of our stack but like it's fine. Like it, if it's not easy and we can't figure it out, then I obviously don't want to like try to smash a square pet, you know, square peg, round hole type thing.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right. Yeah. Absolutely. I'd say about for, to manage, you know, to do like an executive assistant to manage a personal email. It works about 50 percent of the time. It's definitely not our bread and butter use case, right? So.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Let, how about this? Let me talk to my support team here. They're just not responding fast enough right now that's.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  fine. And do we want to talk about some of the other features while we have you, just so we can understand them. Yeah.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Sure.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  So I think in terms of understanding how to effectively use tags, sort of what I was reading is you guys use different tags in different inboxes. Is that generally, like based on the use case?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, exactly. I mean, the tags are completely customizable, right?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  So, do you recommend that those tags follow through? So, if we have like a tagging scheme for like Asana as an example, do you like to try to map those tags to match those tags or does it matter? It?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's it's up to you. It really doesn't matter honestly, that's okay. That's not a conversation that I've had very.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Much, okay. And then in terms of like the email template creation and like that kind of thing, are we able to build like a template library that we share with the whole team in here? Yeah. And so I would go into like the email templates and start creating them. And then, is that, could I copy that to the other inbox too? Like if we liked one, we could say this can be available through this inbox. So, as an example, like obviously, the team's not going to have access, the only person who will have access to my inbox will be lulu. But like on the other one, the entire team will have access because they work out of it. If I start creating templates that I think are beneficial to them, am I able to share it with both mailboxes? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Yeah, perfect.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And I was able to get somebody from our tech support to join here as well. Somm, can you hear me? Yes?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Hi, matt. Hey.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Emillie, do you mind showing him, yeah, the promotional and walking him through what you're trying to do here? Yeah.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Hi. Somm, so we have tried this a couple different ways and I feel like maybe someone like yourself now that I have you like with voice, I can get what we need. Gmail as a filter, filters out promotional emails perfectly. We've deleted and added back in all our filters because what our understanding, is that anything that hits the inbox, goes to hiver. So, a big piece of this is the skip the inbox function. We continue to troubleshoot that and have that in it is literally actually our only filter currently in Gmail, except for like individuals who are blocked, which wouldn't matter. But what's happening is that these promotional emails are still hitting are unassigned in hiver. What I've been trying to do is create some sort of like rule. So that way our automation, I forget what you guys call it, but basically a rule. So that way any of these promotional emails unsubscribe whatever it is, starts to filter it out because our primary use case for this is like an executive assistant operating out of my inbox. Okay. So I was hoping you could help me… got.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  It, can you show me one of the recent emails that landed in the shared inbox? Emillie? Sure.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Right here?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Okay. And, can you click on the to and the from address ones under would land direct? Yeah. And you have also created a filter for this particular address? The, the address from which it came the no, and,

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  I'm not going to do that. There'd be thousands of them. This should all be able to be filtered by like the do not replies at or whatever. I want it to be like unsubscribe, like there should be enough sort of generic stuff. We can filter this by that are like common in promotional emails. To get this out of here, which is the same way Gmail filters work, right? It's like, hey, look for these, you know, and that captures 90 percent. I'm not looking to get 100 percent accuracy. I'm not like a crazy person, but I'm getting like four times the amount of promotional to work emails right now, right? Got.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  It got it. Emillie, so like filter should work fine. But then we need to like figure out something which is specific to these sort of emails. So, how about like let's see if you click on filter messages like this. Like, does it show up? Anything like scroll up on this email particularly and click on the three dots on the right side beside reply here. Can you click on filter messages like this?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  This is, but then it's just taking woodland direct. It's not giving us any other.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Okay. And so, but again,

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  it is filtering it to promotions in Gmail correctly? It's just not filtering it in hiver correctly. So it's archived. It's in promotion. It's doing the right thing on the Gmail side, it's just showing up as unread and unassigned in hiver. Okay? Because it's hitting the inbox even though it's set up as skip the inbox, which is really weird. So, I don't know why that's not working. All right, let,

Sommsubhra Datta:
  me, let me also check the settings of the shared inbox settings on the backend ones. Matt, if you could share the ug ones with me please?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep. Okay. Thanks. It's here we go.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  I'm gonna, are you in the bay area? Matthew? No, I'm in.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  I'm in Los Angeles actually, yeah, that the background's fake. You look, so.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Much like my friend Jordan who's from the bay area, and he has like 10 brothers and sisters and I would literally be like, I was gonna be like, are you related to Jordan Abraham by chance? Because it is crazy?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  No, Jordan, Abraham? Nope. No.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  He's a cool dude. So that's.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  so it's a compliment. It's.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  a, it's a high compliment? Cool. I'll take it. Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Awesome. Soma, I sent you, it, let me know if you got it. I sent it to you on slack.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  I got it. I got it Matthew.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Okay. Fantastic.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  And you, you're located in the,

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  We're in the DC area D.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  C area. Okay? Nice.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Yeah. We have, some of our team members are on the west coast. We have someone in L a and someone in Seattle, but we're predominantly based in DC. Okay. Nice. Is it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Is it, are you guys getting some snow today too? I know, the weather in the.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  East coast is pretty bad. No snow, but it's really cold. Yeah, it's like really cold. Is it cold out there? Have you guys gotten any?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I mean, not as cold as you guys, but, yeah, it's gotten it's. Definitely, it's never gonna.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Be as cold as it is here.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, but it's definitely gotten cold. Yeah. And yeah, I've just seen the news. The news is just like the east coast is getting quite cold right now. Yeah, it's not.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Terrible. But it's definitely chilly. No, no snow yet. We'll get like a little bit of random hail. There you go.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Okay. I see that this is a, this is a Gmail account, shared inbox, right? Emillie, the principal shared inbox, it is and, okay. And, and did we also, so we need to create the filter in the actual Gmail account so that, they are filtered out in the original account. Is this?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Your account? I did it, is it's a, it's so, I'm the head of our firm. And so, part of this is that like I'm out so much. So, lulu is my new executive assistant and office manager is managing my inbox because I often am a bottleneck because I'm not in the office. And so what we're trying to do is truly just use my email which is currently like mission control for our like team just so she can help move things along while I'm like not available for half the day. So, when we have this, I am getting these like I have this set up and it's we're working. I just maybe, you know, a different because right now it is going into Gmail promotions. Okay? So.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Yes. So, like the email, like the email should land in the Gmail account. If, if you are skipping inbox, it should not show up in the primary inbox, but just to be sure, is this your account or the original account? It is the one you're looking at?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  They're both my, I'm the owner, they're both my account, okay?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  And right.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Now, this one is, this one is your account, right? Or?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  We're in everything we're looking at is the primary account, the account that the hiver's linked to everything?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Okay. Can, can you log in once to the actual account? Emily? Like, the shared inbox account, I mean, the principal shared inbox Gmail account once.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  We're in it, that's what I'm trying to tell you. We're in.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It? Okay. And,

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  this has.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Only three filters, right? Right?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Because I deleted all my filters in an attempt to fix this issue and still haven't fixed it.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Ideally, ideally, Emily, the like, in case you want those emails to completely not land in the actual inbox, like in this inbox, I would recommend creating a Gmail filter back again, like how you had for skip inbox, let's say for the promotional email, like you showed for the, that particular address that you showed earlier. Can you, can you open one of those emails one more time? Please? So.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Here's, the filter. If you go through, it says skip inbox, as the label, is that not the right thing to do… skipping?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  The inbox is correct. Yes, the Gmail label you're applying that's also fine. Ideally, what should happen is the email should not be landing in the primary inbox, it should go into your all mail. And it will apply that particular label that you selected the st, hyphen fyi, label, the Gmail label?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Yes. So, if I go to inbox, this is the current inbox setup, right?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Okay. Is that right to you?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yep.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  This, this looks fine. So, you have, so.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  If I go to inbox that's now showing up in I'm just in Gmail, I'm not in hiver right now, it shows up in promotion. So we can take a random one, which is this okay?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Right. Click on the, yep, I can see that. Can you click on the three dots? One more time on the top, right?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Click on.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Filter messages like this for this one? Okay. And how about, so, so these emails, all these emails that we see on the background, like are those from? So those are all promotional emails, right? Which are from, yeah.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  And they're filtered out in Gmail, but showing up unassigned and unread in hiver… Let me.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  check one more thing. Just a minute.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Matthew, while somm's, troubleshooting, this, is there anything that you can think of that I really should be tapping into as a small team, thinking about the hiver tools connecting to slack, any of those things that you see being really effective for people to use that, you know?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Just, we should be?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Paying attention to. I see this views. Should I look at different views? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  The team view is one of the most important views within hiver. Yep. Exactly. That's the team.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  View. Okay. The.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Team view allows you to see all the open emails that are signed across the team. Okay. You can see there that if you look at lulu's name on the left hand side there, you can see that there's a four next to her. If you click on her name… on the left hand side there. Oh, I see. Yeah, perfect. So, these are all the emails that you've assigned to lulu. Okay, right? So you can click on any of them. You can see all the back and forwards. You can see all the responses lulu makes. So, yeah, this is the team view allows you to see all the emails, all the replies, everything from your team here, and you could even, you know, you could even take… her emails, your emails and then mass assign them to other people in this view as well? Okay? So that, yeah, the team view is fairly helpful in this view.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Do you think it's if we had a decent Google group and wanted to do actually don't think it works. I don't think we need like a team inbox. Yeah, I really don't I don't think so. Either cause the orders thing gets solved. Are there any other tools in it that you really like that people, you know, don't think of enough or we should be thinking about? Yeah, I.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  think just effectively using the tags to categorize them will be.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Helpful. And how do you see tags? So like generally, what we'd heard is like tags should be state and owner. But because you guys assign owner, that doesn't really make sense anymore, right?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah… exactly. It's more like think categories. Okay. Right? Like, so you can basically categorize these emails and then you'd be able to see the tags here. And then there's also the tags view. If you click the tags view on the left side.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  I see.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Then you can see all the emails associated with those tags got.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  It, so doing more on the status of an email rather than… like if something's requiring follow up or do people use multiple layers of tags? Do you see that often? Yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You could use, yeah, you could use multiple tags definitely.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Okay. Right. Do you think so we?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Have project based work? Do people generally tag projects to them or no, would they just assign it to like that department? We.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Really, it's we have over 10,000 companies using us. So it's pretty, everyone's pretty different. Do you have any other?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Interior design firms using it that you could look at, that would be helpful to kind of understand how other creative or interior design like project based teams use it just because I think one of the things because we're small trying not to over inundate. And one of the things I've read about like adoption as a whole is like too many tags creates too much noise, basically like you don't want too many tags, I think somm's back though with more information, right? Yeah.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Yes, Emily, if you could just also share the message idea of one of those emails like the one that we were looking into earlier promotional emails, if you could open one of those.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Sure.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  And click on the three dots one more time.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Sure. On the top.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Sure. Regional, yes, I need the first at the top, the green highlighted part, the one which says message id, if you could copy and send.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  It in the chat. Yes, that'll be great. Okay. No problem. Thank you. So what it?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Looks like these emails are actually landing in the original account. It's still landing in the actual account of the shared inbox email address, which is why it's showing up in the like, it's getting synced with the hiver, shared inbox as well. But I'm just looking into the logs from the backend, give me a few minutes so that I can just verify it with you, Emily. Yeah, I.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  am sure it has something to do with this like skip inbox thing, cause that it says if it does that it should work, but is it that like I can't have that promotions filter on the Gmail inbox? Is what I was thinking? I don't know.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  So I think it's not skipping the inbox right at this moment. Emily, it's still.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  I agree. Yeah, yeah.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Peace and peace. I sent you a link. I sent you a link to our customer case studies and it's sorted on the left hand side by industries. Not sure if we have exactly, I'm sure we have customers that are, I don't know if we have any case studies that are specifically interior design. This is just to give you some ideas here.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Thank you for your patience, Emily, Matthew. So, I just checked the logs. I mean, it looks like the email did sync with the actual account like the original account, which is why it synced with the hiver share inbox. The only solution out here since these emails are not getting filtered by Gmail, I would suggest is creating recreating the similar kind of a skip inbox filter that you had earlier, for the individual addresses. Can you confirm like, do you get any other sort of emails from this particular address? Let's say for info at the rate at the most com, do you get other email which are probably you want to be in the shared inbox from this?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Let me see. Cause the issue is because we order from a lot of these companies. So, yeah, see, I have an order also from them. So they, this is the issue with our industry as a particular like as a case study. So we, all of these promotional emails that we're getting are from companies we purchase from. And so the risk that we have to have like we will always have to have a human level of like searching for orders in the actual Gmail inbox. I'm less concerned about those getting filtered out. They just can't get deleted. But as long as they exist in Gmail, we can also like use like if the word order is in the subject line or receipt that's probably good enough. But yeah, we do get, unfortunately, we will get emails from them that we do need. We can't delete forever.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Understood. So, with automations, let's say for shared inbox automations, if you're using shared inbox automations, you can, you do have the option to filter out emails using based on the subject line. Let's say, let's say you have an email from the same email address. So, so ideally you want all these emails to sync in the shared inbox, but then there would be few sort of emails that you.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  No, I really want them to just be close like most of them to just be closed automatically. Like, I think the easier game plan here is to apply a wide range filter that has like anything with unsubscribe in it or anything with some of those like big nets to immediately go to closed. And.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Then if I can layer a.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Rule in it that if like the subject line has order or receipt in it, then the rule doesn't apply, right? Like that's an easy, enough, it will get us close enough to what we need. Got it. Let.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  me, let me check this just a second.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Okay.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  That's really helpful.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Thanks for your patience. Emily, I just checked. So currently, there's no way to filter out the emails specifically. So let's say if you create a filter for like let's say we create a filter for any particular email address, which is, let's say, let's take this example of the info address at the most. If you create a Gmail filter in the actual account, it would react the same for all the emails that's coming from that particular address. So… within like, so the automation comes in part like place once the emails are synced with the shared inbox or the actual, right?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  But that's happening. We're obviously not skipping the inbox. So how can we manage it with hiver rules, right?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Correct. So, currently, what you're looking for, let's say, for emails from the same address, which has let's say the keyword order or receipt in one particular subject line, you want those emails to be in the shared inbox, right? And the other rest of it, you want them to be closed like without any action or let's say you want them to be skipping the actual account. That particular part won't be it's not something which like not an option at this moment. I would say, Emily, we can either you can create a filter to skip all the emails from that particular address, or you can let it be and then manually let's say, move the emails in bulk which are not needed, probably, which are coming under that, from that particular address, you can filter them out using the Gmail filter.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  The Gmail filter isn't working. I have to not get every promotional email in hiver. So, if we want to filter out this address, that's fine. What you're saying is we need to do the manual labor of individually filtering all several 100 promotional addresses in order for hiver to work. No.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  You can filter them out all at bulk. Let's say you can create a filter for this particular address. You can create it. Now, going ahead, any email that's coming from info at it would skip the inbox. It would skip the inbox, and, it won't show up in your Gmail. I mean, in your hiver inbox views, if you're creating a filter to skip the inbox, in the actual, but I.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  did do that? I have a skip the inbox filter and it's filtering these correctly in Gmail. But not in hiver. So, do you want to, do you want to explain to me what I do in hiver? Oh, can you?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Okay. Got it. Can, can you show me the filter? Let's say for this one, the one which we are looking at info at the rate at uttermost, can you review that, do?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  You want me to show you the Gmail filter? Is that what you're asking?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Yes, yeah.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  It's not based on that actual email address. It's what gets it over to promotions, right? And that's all I've asked it to do is skip the inbox come to promotions and it is.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Skip the inbox.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  You go back one more time, of course.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  It looks like this should work, but then, it's still, this, these emails are still showing up in the actual account. Emily, probably, this filter is not working for those emails. So, as long as the email shows up in the original account, can you like probably show me the email one more time? Like any of those emails, the like promotional emails? Okay. There's.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  the promotions tab, this is the promotions tab in Gmail. Okay?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Can you open one of those emails? Please? Sure, anyone… and this synced with the shared inbox? Yep. Okay. So, this has, so on the body, it has the words like that you mentioned on promotion or?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Yeah, it has enough to catch it. Yep, unsubscribe a bunch of stuff that would catch this.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Yep. I see that… this emails are still syncing with the actual account, Emily, which is why it's syncing with the shared inbox. Let me check one more thing, just a second.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Okay.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Emily, can you also share the message id of another email you shared already for one of the emails that I looked into before? Can you share message id for one sec? Yeah, this one would work, click on the three dots. Yep, three dots. Yeah, click on, show original, the last option and… message id, the group, the one in the green at the top.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  This one might have to do with the, like other email on this thing, the alias?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  This was sent directly to the, yeah, the rate.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  No, it wasn't it was sent to E, at Norton dot homes, right?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  And then some.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Are sent to? So like this one is definitely sent to.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Norton dot homes. Okay?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  So, and,

Sommsubhra Datta:
  that's not the,

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  primary.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Right. I see the shared inbox address is nortoninteriors. Com. So, can you, so, do you have any forwarding or anything set up in the actual account or?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  It's an alias.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Okay. Yeah… it's probably the alias is still delivering the email to the shared inbox address, which is, let me verify the logs of this one, which is the nortoninteriors. Com… the shared inbox address, and hiver is showing up in it's, syncing in the shared inbox as well. Let me verify the logs of this email, the one that we shared just now?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  This one as well. So, this was sent to the alias address, which is the Norton dot homes. And then through Gmail. It did sync with the shared inbox address, which is why it shows up for the, under the shared inbox view.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So either.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Like, so, is it that all the emails are coming to the alias address? And then they sync to the original account? Or I actually.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  don't know.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Let me see the other one that you sent just a second. It looks.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Like they all are coming to the alias address.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  This one didn't.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  this did not sync with the shared inbox.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  It did. They all, did they, it's I think I have to filter the alias address.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Now, if you see this, these emails are not synced with the shared inbox. So, these are in the Gmail account of this account. So on the right hand side, if you see it still shows, add to shared inbox, which means it's it, hiver did not sync this email to the shared inbox yet.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So, this is.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  In the inbox that you're looking at for all these emails that you see, they are in the, yeah, these emails are not part of the hiver, shared inbox. They are only in the inbox of this particular Gmail account. So, any email that shows on the right hand side, add to shared inbox, means it's not yet. So, this one is part of the shared inbox. It's already added to the shared inbox. The one we opened just now. Yeah. And this was sent directly to the shared inbox address.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Most likely, what's happening is the alias is still bypassing the filter that's there either like it's like, for… the, like, you know, for the most of the addresses that you have set up. So it's not actually skipping the inbox for most of the emails, which is why it's still syncing in the inbox of this shared inbox address. And hiver is also syncing it. So.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  This one, it, did, you see?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  syncing the shared inbox. Yes. So, this one was sent. So, this one was copied to the inbox through a mailing list. So this is, if you see there's also a mailing list for this address at the bottom under this, yep. And this one was sent from a.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  This is the alias, it's through, it's making it through still.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Right, right. So, which,

Sommsubhra Datta:
  means the alias, so few emails are still skipping the filter when they're sent to the alias. So the alias emails are syncing with the actual account, which is why hiver is syncing in what you can do. So, you want these emails that sent to the alias address to be syncing into the shared inbox, going ahead anyway, right? So I just,

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  need the promotions out of here. I don't really know how else to say it like that's. That's the core of this. I don't I'm just trying to figure out how to troubleshoot that.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Okay. So promote promotions is something Emily, which is completely managed by Google. Like these emails are showing up in the inbox because they are syncing with the original Gmail account. The solution here would be, I would suggest is creating a Gmail filter to skip inbox for all those emails so that they don't sync up at all now, since that you already have it for the way you have created it is for the like, you know, with the keywords, if they have promotions and all this, yeah the newsletter and all the keywords that you have mentioned in case, if that works, I would suggest you can create a filter for like the two address of those emails and check, you know, monitor, if that helps like instead of creating the filter through common keywords… okay? I, as long as the emails are not syncing or skipping the inbox, hiver won't sync it to the shared inbox, Emily, in case the emails are like bypassing… the filter that you have, and it's landing to the actual Gmail account. Hiver would sync it to the shared inbox. Like we saw, few emails are not, few emails are actually being filtered out with your existing filters which are not synced with the shared inbox. And then few emails are bypassing the filter that you have, which are anyway syncing to the shared inbox.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Because it's sunk. But when you go to unassigned it's not there.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It's closed, right?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Now, so it will be in the closed view, Emily, but it just,

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  came in zero minutes ago? So, how did it get closed?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  So that the.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  filter we put worked on this because.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Of the info app?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Can you refresh the page once? Can you probably take the subject? Okay? Yeah.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Can I then create a rule that any like thing with receipt or order in the like a filter in Gmail that anything with receipt and order gets marked? Important?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Yes. But then,

Sommsubhra Datta:
  this email was closed, can you on the right hand side, can you scroll down on the activity panel once? Yep? Yeah. So the automation closed it, correct? So you have automation set up?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  So, the automation worked now, I just need to layer the automation with anything?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  With.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  those, so, can I layer on top of that automation? So that way, okay. So, if I go in here and I were to say like it's not that.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  It's in the admin, but, yeah.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Yeah. Sorry, I'm getting used to it. So I'd go into here and then I would say like create automation?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Or would I.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  do it in this one?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Yes, you can edit it. You can click on the three dots, edit. You can add the additional conditions that you would like to include be included in this?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  But it's… hang on.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Like that because.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  I wouldn't close.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  It, does it make sense?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  So, add the condition of subject?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Do you know what I mean? Like?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  That one would need to be its own separate rule?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Because it's the opposite of this.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  So, do you see what I'm saying? This is what closes it. So there needs to be a rule that doesn't close it?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  For a set of.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  emails, is that what you're what you would like to do, right? Well.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  It's anything? Yeah, a new email is received if the subject contains?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Any of receipt or order?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Add… step action is?

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  Fine.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Right. Okay. So you also want them, to have the status open, right? Can you open that? Can you open the one that you had before the promotion emails to close the first?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Yeah. I also need to title it, hang on one sec. Sure.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  And can you open the first automation one more time? Okay. Hang.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  On, let me just title this. So I don't forget.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Sure.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  See here? Okay. And.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  so, this is for new inbound conversation is received body content, unsubscribed?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  These, so, so basically for the other one which you want to be open, right? Those, those will be, also, so for them, what's… the body condition, you're using, okay, receipt and okay, that's the subject condition using, which is receipt and order. Okay? And, yeah, yeah, that should work. Fine. I would suggest keeping that automation on top of this automation. So scroll back once. I mean, go back once, yeah, drag it to the top. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that should be perfect. So, in this way, what would happen is, even if like, so like an email which comes in. So basically the automation which are,

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  it runs these in order, correct?

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Whichever is in the top would run, which would run first, yep, correct?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Okay. Thank.

Matthew P (matthew.p@grexit.com):
  You… Emily. I.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  Think I'm sure you would have more queries or a few other follow up questions with different functions and features. You can always reach out to us on the chat as well or let us know on like on email as well. If you have anything, then we can jump on a call and help.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  You sort it. Thank you, you're.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  welcome. Anything else you want to help you right now? No?

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  That's all. Thanks so much you're.

Sommsubhra Datta:
  welcome, Emily. Have a good day. Thank you. Bye. Okay.

E Millie Norton (e@nortoninteriors.com):
  Bye.
