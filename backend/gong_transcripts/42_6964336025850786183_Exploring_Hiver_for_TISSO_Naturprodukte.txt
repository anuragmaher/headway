================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  hey, axel, can you hear me?

Axel Sonnenstuhl (axel.sonnenstuhl@tisso.de):
  Hey, yes, I can hear you. How are you? Doing? Great. Thank you all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. We've got Simone here as well. Hey, Simone. How's it going?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Hello. How are you? Nice to meet you, nice.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  To meet you as well. It's a pleasure meeting both of you that's about it from the hiver team at least for today. So, I thought I'd kick us off with a quick round of introductions. I'm Raghav, I'm going to be working with you as a primary point of contact during the evaluation phase and going forward, I will be the account manager with the hiver relationship. So I'll be working alongside Leander who I believe you've been working with axel all this while and I'll be an added account. It's a pleasure meeting both of you today. Yes, go ahead. I.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Also see my camera is not one thing. Okay? Yes, it's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So as far as heading into the agenda for today's, call and heading into the call as well, Leander did fill me in, Simone that you take care of the international sales team and that you're interested in exploring hiver for your team. Could you maybe, you know, kick me off with the brief about how you work today, what tools you use, and then we can build on top of it from there, yeah?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  So, we are working almost in the same way as Germany. So all orders and yeah, our shop orders as well as some email addresses reach one Google group, which is a separate group to German group. And yeah, due to internal organization for me, it's a question if it makes sense to have a separate hiver group as well only for this orders group or if you for example, recommend to put everything in one group, doesn't matter if the orders come from Germany or abroad or if there are emails whatever. In this case, of course, I should know more, should understand if hiver is able to separate directly to spread all these different orders, emails, whatever into, yeah, German order, German emails for the German sales team and to the export teams because currently we have the problem, it's not really a problem but there's a case that we lose sometimes some days until we can answer because we get forwarded the emails from the German team. And yeah, sometimes people are a little bit nervous are calling, are sending, whatsapp are trying to contact us via seven different ways to get an answer because we are losing time with all these old school emails. So this would be interesting for us if there is an opportunity to match everything together and hiver separates it or how we could use hiver. I.

Axel Sonnenstuhl (axel.sonnenstuhl@tisso.de):
  think that's basically, the use case… because, we have separate accounts and, but we do have sort of collaboration within, the teams. So for us, it would be yeah… good to know, which way we should go with exceeding hiver or do we have, a separate team, a separate shared mailbox? Or do we put all together and… work with automations? For example? Got?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It, no that's actually a great starting point. So, Simone and axel when you say separate groups versus consolidating the two together. Could you tell me a little bit about the kind of work that goes into that inbox? Like for instance, what I'm trying to understand is, does the German team handle a lot more clients and more conversations as opposed to your team? Yes. And in terms of people as well, I'm assuming axel's team's got more folks than yours does?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Yes. So you can if you want axel. Okay. So in Germany, we have about, I don't know between 1,502 1,000 incoming emails including orders from our online shop. I suppose more or less depending on the season and we have in the export department, maybe 202 150. So currently, our online shop knows if there is a foreign order, foreign means from any other country than Europe. Doesn't matter if the invoice address or the delivery address is foreign, then these orders reach one Google group. If customers from Germany with German delivery address and German invoice address, place an order, it comes into another group and this group, yeah, in Germany, they are working maybe 10, 15 people. I don't know, exactly. No, I'm thinking about.

Axel Sonnenstuhl (axel.sonnenstuhl@tisso.de):
  10. Yeah, the.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Income orders or incoming subjects are separated. They're distributed by 20 50 whatever. And then the person is treating one after the other of his own number of emails. That means that for example, there are emails incoming. It's yeah, a customer who is a German customer, but he wants a delivery to Austria, but he doesn't choose Austria. He yeah, gives a German address but which is in fact an Austrian address or a parcel shop or whatever. Then they distribute it to another person. Oh, it's not for me. It's for the export department and forwards this email to us. So depending on the day per week and the hours, if these persons are working eight hours or less or whatever, of course, it can take time or we lose time. Sometimes. Yeah, in Germany, we work almost in the same way. We get in the export department, we work almost in the same way. So we have maybe 202 150 incoming emails including orders. Basically, it's one person who is treating all these and then manually distributing them to three or four others. Except if there is really a big number of emails after a weekend or after public holiday, then there are two person working on these emails. And also one starts with the newest and the other one starts with the oldest, got it. That's how we work.

Axel Sonnenstuhl (axel.sonnenstuhl@tisso.de):
  But I think that's… a very manual work we did. And we due to today, I think what, where we started with haiva, mid December, we, we're facing, very good.

Axel Sonnenstuhl (axel.sonnenstuhl@tisso.de):
  Results. So we have, we tag and automate, the emails and assigning them, to different people. But if we think forward to that, in the sales international sales department, that could work quite well too. Because if we automate, some subjects or, some senders are assigned directly to one or another person, that would reduce a lot of manual work. And yeah, and due to service level agreements et cetera, we could speed up a little bit and work more effectively and more customer centralized work. No.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's that's accurate. So the one thing that I would want to add to your thought process when you're trying to decide, hey, do I keep Germany and international teams separate or do I combine them both into one group? Look at it from a perspective of how you see this scaling in like the next six months to one year, right? So when it comes to processes, if the German workload is the highest, then looking to consolidate the international team within the German teams group, or having one Google group on hiver, would make the most sense. The second thing to look at is email visibility. So if, when you combine groups on hiver, when you have two people on the same hiver group, what essentially happens is every email becomes visible to everybody on the group. So if axel were to add you, Simone to his hiver instance on his mailbox, then you can see literally every email happening inside his inbox. So if email visibility is not a concern and you don't mind that the international team, Germany team doesn't make a difference as long as somebody sees the email and the relevant person is working on it, then consolidating again would be the better route because in the long term, it would make it easier for coverage when there is like volume excess. The other example you mentioned Simone, which is sometimes it goes to the wrong team and that has to be redirected to the right team, that handoff becomes a whole lot more simpler if you've got everybody into the same inbox and into the same Google group as well when it comes to emails entering the system. Now, one thing I do want to ask as like, you know, getting more details here, Simone is in terms of processes for your team. So email comes in, they check out the conversation. What happens after that? Like what do they do… 80?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Percent of these emails are orders. So the, they proceed the order and mark the email as finished as closed. The other emails, yeah, they have to read what the customer is writing, if it's an inquiry or an offer for raw material, or any delivery problem, or somebody wants to cancel his subscription, or there are many different subjects. Yeah, almost the same as in Germany, I would say got.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It, so coming from that perspective of having very similar sort of outcomes, you're looking to track with hiver, and, you know, with your team to axel's, point, I would suggest that we start looking at automating more of this process. And when I say automating, there's two types of automations you do on hiver. One is what we call customer front and these are automations that send out reminders. These are automations that can send out acknowledgements. And these are also automations that could just send out an autoresponder agnostic saying, hey, we've received your email. We'll get back to you within 24 48 hours right now. These types of automations that are customer facing means emails go out to your clients and your vendors. At the end of the day. These could be made to fit a certain mold, which means 80 percent is just order tracking and order confirmation. Then you could set up a rule on hiver that says, hey, if email comes in, it's talking about an order being placed, send a reply to the customer saying, hey, we've received your order. We'll check with the team and we'll get back to you within 24 hours. Whereas on the other hand, if it's something that the team has to do more work on refund, address, change, anything of that sort, then you could set up an automation that says, hey, thanks for writing in. It's going to take us two working days to get back to you. And then at the back of it, you know, have it routed assigned to the right person tagged in a certain way and all that. So there are automations that you can do that are customer facing like this. And when it comes to internal or operational automations, we've got a lot more options there because these are things that are within hiver. For instance, you could set up SLA, timers that are condition specific, refunds, could be 24 hour processing time… address changes could be 48 hours whereas an auto confirmation could be four hours. So you can stagger these kinds of alerts and notifications and get that going as well. And when it comes to AI, I don't think axel, your team's using a lot of AI on hiver so far, right?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Not not yet, so.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's another avenue where we could look for rooms of improving because axel since December, basically we've launched a new part of hiver's AI inside automations. So far it's just keywords and everything. Now you could sort of ideate with the AI saying, hey, I'm looking for this information, specifically, get that. And if it's there do an action based on it, right? That's the level to which you can break it down. So when we're looking at like when I'm seeing this six months, one year down the line, combining the two. If email visibility is not a problem and you want to scale this, then combining the two would make it easier. Now on the other side, Simone more for you in this front, when it does combine everything you do also have one, your reporting will be central and tags or categories on hiver will be the primary way in which you tell the difference for yourself and your team versus axel's team in Germany, right? So we're happy to like give enough training sessions and make sure the team is up to speed and you get comfortable working that way. But I do want to tell you it's not going to be a dedicated space just for your team. It will be shared with axel's team, right down to reporting outcomes, resolution times and all of that stuff, right? So that's the first thing I want to mention in terms of consolidation, what that looks like. And the second thing is while you're consolidating and you're growing your team, let's say six months to one year down the line, you want to split again and you want to be like, hey, now my team is big enough and I want to have a separate inbox for my team, a dedicated space then you would be looking at to an extent starting from scratch when it comes to the rules when it comes to the existing data within axel's team. And that is also something that I'd like for you to like keep in mind when you're thinking of this route. Now generally from experience with all the different teams I've spoken with consolidation has been the best way forward especially if email visibility and reporting clarity is not, you know, like a concern or like a big problem or a blocker for them to go ahead with it?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  No, not at this point or at this point? Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So then in that… case, I think Simone, it does make sense for us to start discussing around a consolidated route. Now, some of the things that would be helpful for me to have as planning for our next call where we dive into hybrid detail. I show you the features in more detail and everything would be understanding how many people in your team work out of this inbox or do you expect to be part of this inbox? And what would they typically be doing? I know you said 80 percent is just auto processing, but outside of that, is there anything else that they will do that's more internal at your company as opposed to stuff going out to your customers?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  It's more an internal strategy question what we are going to do with hiver or what we keep with Google whatever. So we are a person in my team. We are looking for the fifth. Yeah, and most of them, it's really operational work. So tweeting orders, answering emails, things like this got.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  It so does seem like it's relatively straightforward in a place of where you're coming from a manual place and you want to try to streamline it and automate whatever is possible just to do that first step today, yeah.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  But it's possible to automate a distribution of emails. So, does hiver, yes. See, recognize that an email order comes from a foreign customer and can distribute it directly to yeah an identified person? Or is it still manually that somebody has to distribute those blocks of 20 blocks of 30 50 emails to different employees? No?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that's actually a great question. At this point. I think I'll do a little bit of show and tell just to make it more meaningful for you because I'm not sure if you've seen the platform but can you see my screen now? Yes. All right, perfect. So, Simone, in your case, this is what you and the remaining three members of your team. Your Gmail accounts would start looking like. You will have just that one central inbox which will be combining yours and the German team's, Google groups together as one source. Now, when it comes to automating email routing or email ownership in itself, there is quite a few options using which you can automate email assignment as we call it. Right now. One of the ways in which you can use it is to base it on the subject line. Are you using Shopify as your platform for tracking order completion and everything not?

Axel Sonnenstuhl (axel.sonnenstuhl@tisso.de):
  Yet, but we're working on it. We're… we have a good manner, that we will let's.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  say, axel is fighting for it?

Axel Sonnenstuhl (axel.sonnenstuhl@tisso.de):
  No, no, I'm fight is one fight is one, I think… six.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Six.

Axel Sonnenstuhl (axel.sonnenstuhl@tisso.de):
  Months, six to eight months. And now actually, we work on Magento.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Okay. So in that case, then I'm gonna take the more straightforward route of automating it. And this is gonna be primarily based on emails being received and the kind of conditions you set up at this point, Simone. So what you can do is you can either use AI as the differentiator to tell the difference or you can put it hard coded as a condition. For example, we can set up something that says, if the subject of the email contains the words order placed, for example or new order, then you would want hiver to assign it as the ownership for Aditya as a person, right? So that's the very straightforward first step of automating assignments. And it gets interesting when you have more conditions, like if you want to be very specific and you're saying, hey, if I've got a variable that I configured for instance, and this was the AI part that I was talking about some excel. So we can see like, hey, instead of this hiver, check the incoming email. And in that incoming email, see if the delivery address is Germany, for example, just a quick suggestion there, right? So obviously, you'll build out the prompt with more details, in which case hiver starts learning more and identifying it better. But just table stakes getting it started will say, hey, okay. So these are the information that I want you to extract from the email that I get out of. This is delivery address in Germany and the detected country are probably two things that are very relevant for our workflow. What we can do is basically saying, all right, hiver. Now that you've got the data, I want you to check the delivery address variable, right? If it is in Germany, then, you know, we can again set it all up based so that if it's yes, it gives a yes as a result. Basically, we can be like if the delivery address is yes and it's in Germany, then I want hiver to round Robin that email, we call it a sign among round Robin, it between just the German team and you can set up a rule like that. And if it's not Germany as the delivery location, round Robin, it between Simone's, team of three people, right?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  It looks great for me. So.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's some of the ways in which you could handle future.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Is coming.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So… that's one of the ways in which you can use to like handle email. And again, even when it comes to hiver doing the round Robin, you can either be like do a proper round Robin, everybody gets one email a piece or you can be like do load balancing. So, if three people in the queue, rather already has 10 and the other two just have five, then the other two keep getting more till they all come to 10. So hiver takes care of balancing that load as well, tries to equalize it as much as possible.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  That's also interesting. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's one of the routes in which you could sort of automate things on hiver. Some of the other examples I mentioned earlier, right? Specific scenario based replies being sent out to the client, automatically, the vendor automatically, that could be configured as different rules per each condition, and even categorizing, it could be an automation itself where you see email comes in. If it's from Austria. I want Austria to be mentioned somewhere, a flag somewhere that could be a tag on hiver. It could be a custom field on hiver based on that. You can then start tracking both operation day to day and reporting as well at the end of the day… so that's the automation piece in and of itself. But so far, I've just told you it's primarily based on emails coming in but you can do a whole lot more for instance, if you have an order that's got a certain delivery date and you're waiting on the vendor or the customer to reconfirm the change of delivery address before it's dispatched, you can be like, hey, for cases where I tag as dispatch pending, for instance, I want hiver to send a follow up to the client in… order. So this will work in a way where your team sends out that first email asking for confirmation, and then they can close it and they can move on. Hiver will send that first follow up second email saying, hey, checking in. We never got your address. If we don't hear from you in 24 hours, the order is going to be dispatched to the address that you mentioned when you created the order. A lot of things like that could be customized and set up as an automated workflow through the hiver flow. So, yeah. So continuing from here, there's a lot of AI on hiver. There's a lot of sle tracking and internal operational efficiency mechanisms that you can set up that give you alerts for both the agent and you as the team lead right down to you always getting a notification if a high value client writes in or if an order amount of a certain value sends an email, we could set it up so that axel and Simone get notified because really high ticket value for.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Example that's good. I only treat the big orders… so.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We could give you that leadership preference if we could call it that, right?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  No, no.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Basically reduce you and axel having to see 200 open emails and instead just give you, hey here's, 10 emails where the team actually needs your help and that gives you an easier way to address it, handle it and move on in terms of customizations. The whole platform can be customized in terms of where your team goes to see their queue of emails. How do you track it for them? So there's a lot of defaults that we give you. But there's also like a lot of custom views that you can create. Basically, Simone, you can create a queue that's only for refund requests, another queue that's just for address, change one queue just for order confirmation. And similarly, you know, we can help your team get trained as well on the same process there.

Axel Sonnenstuhl (axel.sonnenstuhl@tisso.de):
  Yes, that's what we have for just Magento orders. We have a separate view and for therapist orders, we have a separate view for refunds and etc, so we can work on it more efficient.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly. And.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  something which is interesting for us as well because yeah, for foreign customers, we ask for payment in advance for the first order. And we have lots of orders from our online shop where customers choose payment in advance. So all these orders are not urgent. Because anyway, we will wait for the payment, the information from our accountant that payment reached us and we'll treat them only when payment is complete went in. So it would be good to have directly a pre selection of all orders with payment in advance which have time which are not urgent. Yeah, totally could also.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Do is if it's prepayment orders that's actually a pretty interesting scenario. We can automate it based on time. Hiver can send follow ups and only when the client replies, would it actually show up to a team member as an active queue email. Otherwise it can just be in a queue, but it's not something they have to see every day as well. So we can make that for them, right? So, yeah, Simone, I mean, as an initial conversation for today, this was just the quick bits I wanted to cover just to show you a bit of the platform and talk about the capability that's possible.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Now, realistically, what I'd like to do is if you have time later this week, set us about 45 minutes, run through your exact use cases, challenges, things you'd like to improve on in more detail. Compare that to hiver, understand how to get it set up and then plan for next steps on commercials as well. Okay?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Yeah, first, thank you very much for your presentation. Very interesting. And I think it would be very helpful for us as well. So, yeah, axel, I think we have to discuss internally if we can add the international sales team to hiver and then make hopefully a second appointment with you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Makes sense. Now, while you're discussing that internally, would you still like to see the platform in more detail? And we can have that discussion in parallel?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  When we decide that we will add the international sales team, then, yes, of course, but I think first we have to have the okay from our managers that we can add the international team.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. That makes sense. Otherwise, I.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Will be too jealous.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that makes sense. So, I mean, in that case, I'm just looking to set up some time as a placeholder because my calendar is filling up really fast this month as you would expect. With everybody coming back. I'm thinking maybe something placeholder for the week of the… month. So, you know, like a 15 minute check in call. And then as we move closer, we can reschedule it, extend it or you can tell me what that looks like. Does that work? Yeah.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  That works all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put us down for 15 minutes, same time, twentieth of January, Tuesday as a tentative call that's good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And if Simone, what I'll also do is after the call, I will send you some collateral in terms of just the general hiver experience, what the pool can do, things like that, if you're interested. Okay? Or if you want to see something in specific, I can work on recording a video and sending it.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Over. Yeah. Okay. Great. Perfect. Thank you. Brilliant. All.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Right. Folks. Thanks so much to the both of you for hopping on today's. Call, any questions? Any doubts? Feel free to send them over to me and fingers crossed for us to meet on twentieth with approval. Yeah.

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Yes, thank you very much. How do you pronounce it?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Raghav?

Simone Axt (simone.axt@tisso.de):
  Okay, perfect. Thank you. Bye.

Axel Sonnenstuhl (axel.sonnenstuhl@tisso.de):
  Thank you. Bye.
