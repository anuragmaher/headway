Mugunth:
  sorry, I was talking and speaking in a minute. So, Raghav, I mean, like let's not complicate things. I've just kept it at 33 dollars.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, that's what we agreed upon that's what we discussed.

Mugunth:
  Yeah. I did some math and then I thought of bumping it up.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  By one dollar. That makes no sense. Yeah.

Mugunth:
  It didn't make any sense. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, basically, we're giving him a five dollar discount, whatever the amount is for that five dollar discount is what we're going to tell him? Okay, correct? Huh. So the five dollar discount brings him to 33 or 34 that's the clarity I want.

Mugunth:
  So, he's technically, he's in 38 point seven, so.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  He's paying 39, which means we'll give him at 34 that's.

Mugunth:
  all, yeah. Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So that's the angle we're going for, if we can't get an exact 34 by discounting on the order form. It'll be 34 point one point two. Something will work out okay?

Mugunth:
  Works. That's all.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  We'll just give some time for this Guy to join. And then I think we should be good to go. Give me a couple as well. Let me get situated. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Is my voice echoing? Can you hear me clearly?

Mugunth:
  Your voice is heavily echoing Raghav.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  How about now?

Mugunth:
  Can you speak again?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Is it better now? Yeah. All right. Sorted?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Mata any increase in usage on AI outside the tagging in the last two, three days since we spoke with him… mugunth?

Mugunth:
  I.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  was asking if there is any increase in AI usage since you spoke?

Mugunth:
  He has just enabled the AI sentiment.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Analysis he is.

Mugunth:
  Only using AI sentiment analysis as of now, Raghav.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Didn't we explore that last time?

Mugunth:
  He didn't touch anything, even the sentiment analysis, what he did this the other day myself and Leander went on a demo and then we turned it on for him, but he accidentally turned it off. And then he asked me, hey, why the sentiment analysis didn't work? So, when I went and checked him, that's when we realized that this Guy has toggled it off, I told him, please let it be as it is. If you toggle it off, it doesn't work only if you toggle it on, it will work. So, yeah. So he's not so technically a savvy customer. We need to handhold him, but, yeah, that's with me. The onus is with me on that front.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, all the best, all the best.

Mugunth:
  Yeah, yeah, nice.

Mugunth:
  Raghav, he's coming. So, I'm letting him in. Okay?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Hello? Hey.

Mugunth:
  Good morning. How are you? Good?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Morning. Good. How are you?

Mugunth:
  I'm doing great as well. Thanks for asking. So, please a quick introduction. So, I also have my colleague, Raghav, your account manager in today's, meeting as well. So go to Raghav for a quick round of introduction.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hi, pleasure meeting you. How's it going today?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  I'm good. I just wanted to let you know that regarding Dai. So first of all, it doesn't work in Hebrew. The sentiment, it doesn't work in Hebrew. It just recognizes English. So it's basically for us, it's not.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Useful. I guess not.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Useful, right? Yeah, just wanted to let you know.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, no, that makes total sense. I did want to ask though because with the sentiment as well, you can tweak it a bit so that it starts identifying newer patterns better. Have you had a chance to like play with the prompt or something like that inside?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Not really. But it's… also, it doesn't when you say, for example, it recognizes keywords, but it's not necessarily means it's either a positive or a negative from our end. So it's like somewhere.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  In between. So, yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  So, from our end right now, like we're not gonna, I don't see any reason to upgrade to the, yeah… yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That makes sense. That makes total sense. You know, what? We can definitely obviously revisit the conversation on the AI. Now that you've given us specific feedback on why it's not gonna make sense for right now. I think that's useful feedback. We'll take it back to the product team. And once or when we make strides in terms of having it better identify emotions on local languages, we'll be sure to make a note and either me or Mukund will probably drop you an email and we can kick off the whole discussion again. Yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. Sounds good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. And I think on that note, we'd pretty much be primarily focusing on the renewal with like the two year contract as well that you showed interest in. So are we still on the same tracker as in terms of the total user count? I think you'd mentioned.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  A, he told me, he told me, listen, I'm from my end. What he told me is that I was about to, and I said, okay, listen, if you renew for two years with a minimum of 20.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  users.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Users. Yeah. Then we can offer some discounts. I said, okay, let's hear about it. Let's see if it's worthwhile from our end.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. Yeah, no, definitely. So what we can do is right now you're on hiver at 39 usd per person per month, right? Right? So if we're locking in a minimum 20 user count for your team on a two year contract, we can effectively reduce your cost from 39 all the way to 34. So full five dollar decrease on the overall subscription, which in your case, would translate to about, you know, five into 20 20 for about 2,400 dollars. Yeah. In terms of total savings overall, you know, just in that excess amount. So to be very precise with the numbers, if you're going to be continuing with the same rate which is 39 for two years, you're looking at 18,720 30.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Nine. How many users are we currently using? 17?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  17.

Mugunth:
  Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, but I'm doing the math for 20 people total, just so that you have that difference in front of you? Yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  So, right now, I'm so if I'm renewing today, we started at 7,956 dollars, right?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, 7,956 with the year on year increase, if it's just a one year contract.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  20 multiplied 34.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, 20 into 35. Oh, sorry. 34, 34, five dollar discount. Yeah, 20 into 34 into 12 that's 8,160. And if you minus that with 20 into 39.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Yeah. I understand what you're saying. Give me a second, please. Yeah, seven nine five, six,

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Interesting.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, you get a 1,000, 200 dollar difference just for year one, and what we can do is lock in that price for both the two years. So there won't be any year on year increase. You don't have to worry about it. Your pricing for hiver stays flat for both the years where the 20 is a minimum.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  So, the only risk I'm having is whether or not we downside or something happens. And then I'm locked in for two years basically.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. Is that like do you foresee any kind of downsizing or anything of that sort happening?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Not really. We're actually, by the way, what happens if we use more, if we have more than 20 users, what happens then it's the same. It's 34.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes. So, what we can do is usually this kind of a discount percentage like the amount of discount we're giving you that's typically reserved for teams of 75 and above that's usually when we go from 49 to like 39 even to begin with, right? So, considering that we've given you close to about a 15, 20 dollar discount, give or take where we're dropping you to 35 from 49, basically, right? About a 15 dollar discount on the overall. Now, if you're.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  yeah, go ahead. Sorry.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I was just going to say if you're looking to grow up to like let's say 20 30 users overall, we can definitely look at the contract again and see if there's an additional incentive we can offer. But if it's just going to be like four people, five people.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Yeah, I understand it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Would remain the same.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, but yeah, I can definitely, you know, you can feel free to reach out to me or to mugunth. And if you're looking at least 20 people as growth, definitely, we can look at renegotiating the contract at that point and working on a price that makes sense?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  One second, I'm just sure. Yeah… calculating something over here.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Take your time.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. You persuaded me, my friend, that was, pretty quick. Yeah. No, it's okay. We can well, let's do it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. All right. I think mugunth's already got the auto form ready. We'll have it sent over to you all we need for. So I need.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  to sign the, is it an agreement?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, it's a proper agreement contract. It'll be mentioning the details like two year contract, minimum 20 users, and this is the duration of the years. It's not going to be a single upfront payment for both the years we've already had that discussion internally and we've broken it. So it's going to be two, one year payments, two annual payments, basically. Okay?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So, that way cash flow is easier for you, right? And like I said, when you are expanding by 20 people or more, feel free to write back to us. We're more than happy to look at pricing again and renegotiate a better deal if it makes sense?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Sounds good. And I appreciate the service. It's really good. And we're really satisfied with your product. So, yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Brilliant. Alright. And on a side note, we'll keep working on the AI, and if at some point in the future, it makes sense when we've got the AI out of space based on your feedback, right? Where it gets better at Hebrew identification, we'll definitely drop you a note. And as a long time customer, we can definitely look at a discounted offering at that point as well.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Sounds good. Okay, great.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. That's it for me. So, I'm going to pass it back to, mugunth, if you have the contract ready, we can probably send it to the rest. Yeah, I.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  appreciate it very much.

Mugunth:
  Yes, I've just dropped you the contract link in the chat box. Can you just open?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  It, the chat box, wait, let's see chat.

Mugunth:
  Open the second link, the resources, maybe you can just share your screen as well. Yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Wait, let me sign… in with Google one second with the fadm.

Mugunth:
  No, no, no, just go to the chat.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  So, why is it? Yeah, I opened the chat.

Mugunth:
  Can I just share your screen? Yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Mugunth, thank you. Check. If you've sent it to everyone on the chat?

Mugunth:
  Okay. Yeah. Got it. Now, there you go.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Yeah. Now, I have it. Okay.

Mugunth:
  Okay. So, as we are very close to the renewal, we didn't want to stretch this beyond this conversation, give.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Me one second. That's what I have. Yeah. Okay. Verify the sign.

Mugunth:
  Yeah.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Then you need to sign it.

Mugunth:
  Yeah, we'll be signing it and sharing the copy. So, now, it will be going to our leadership team for the contest signature.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Now, you're taking it from my credit card, right?

Mugunth:
  Yes.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. Sounds good.

Mugunth:
  Let me just have the chat. Okay? It's pretty much the same. We're not making any change to the contract, just that we are bringing down your pricing and bumped up your discount.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  No problem.

Mugunth:
  Yeah. So, the billing terms, the billing board, everything is going to be one of the same.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Do I need to do anything else?

Mugunth:
  Have you signed it piers?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  I signed, I see the verification, ah, verification sent to my email. Yeah, let's see.

Mugunth:
  I think it should be an info at virtuetax. Com.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. Please verify your identity. Okay? Please verify identity and sign, quote… start signing.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Get started. Click here to sign.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Continue, I agree. Okay, I'm good. Thanks for submitting your document.

Mugunth:
  So, we'll… yeah, I've received it as well. So, now, I'll just get it signed from my leadership team, and then we're good to go. The contract will be amended as per the new terms which we have agreed upon for the years.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay, good. Do you need me on the line or, you want me to wait for?

Mugunth:
  No, no, no, no, that's it from here. All the actions required from my end are completed. Now, year afterwards, it's my job to get it countersigned and can.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  you just send me the contract when you're done? Yes?

Mugunth:
  Yes, I would be doing that once it's countersigned. I'll just send a copy of it for your reference as well. Okay?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. All right. I appreciate the service. Now, again, we'll look up to we'll, look up to, any, new features that you have, and, especially with the AI, and we'll be in contact.

Mugunth:
  Definitely. So also ears, I mean, like, when exactly, could we schedule a follow up session? I know that, you have, mentioned that you're planning to transition to Monday. Com. Hiver does support on integration between Monday. Com, and you also mentioned that you will put me in touch with one of your consultants?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Correct.

Mugunth:
  Run this project along with me to make the best use of hiver. So, when can I schedule this follow up session? Can I schedule one?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  So, so I'll tell you what? I just hired the Guy a few days ago, and I'm, I need to keep him, keep him updated on what's going on over here. So, it's going to take a little like at least a week, but definitely, once we're done, it's going to be in direct contact with you.

Mugunth:
  Absolutely. Okay. I'll just be on, look out for the email from your Guy, your, you know, the, it implementation Guy who will be hired or if I don't hear back from him, I'll just send him a quick note to you in a week or a couple of weeks time. Okay? I,

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  appreciate, it is.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I was also thinking how about we just lock in like 30 minutes in advance, maybe three weeks from now? Yeah, tentatively have something on the calendar?

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  No problem. Okay. We can do that. No problem. Yeah.

Mugunth:
  I'll do that same time. So, you're.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  going to say, yeah, yeah. Ah, wait, let me tell you three weeks is number 24. I'm not going to be between the 20 third and 28. So, it needs to be a week later. So, between, December first and third and, and fourth of, December.

Mugunth:
  Awesome. Okay. Sure. I'll maybe I'll lock our calendars for December first.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  We can, yeah, December first. Sounds good.

Mugunth:
  I can do it for December first. Yeah, thanks Yves. Thank you so much for your time.

EREZ SHAHAM (erez@virtuetax.com):
  Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

Mugunth:
