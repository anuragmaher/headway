Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  hey, Nancy.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Hi, Cole. How are you today?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm good. How are you?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Doing very well.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Nice. I appreciate you hopping on the call. I.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Appreciate you making time for the call.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Are we waiting on a few more folks on your side?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Tracy told me she cannot attend. She unfortunately got a last second invite for something critical she needs to attend to. And then I… don't remember if I forwarded it to our it team, they didn't respond to me. If I did so, I would say we're good to start. Okay, I think we're okay. I can catch them up if needed.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Perfect. But no, I appreciate you hopping on here, Nancy. So just to set a quick agenda, would love to do a quick round of introductions, understand your role, what got you interested in hiver, then we can jump into a product demo, and then we'll just save some time at the end for any questions at next steps.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Yeah, of course. Oh, it looks like we do have Kristen joining us.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Oh, perfect. Hey, Kristen. Hello. How are you? Thank you. Thanks for joining. We were just doing a quick round of introductions, Kristen, so I can kick us off first here, team. My name is Cole miller. I'm a senior account executive here at hiver. I've been in the customer success, space, client experience space for a little over seven years now. And yeah, just looking forward to seeing how we can help you all today.

ChristenHilborn:
  Of course.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  I guess I'll go next. I'm Nancy Devine, I'm a talent development partner here at uspack. I've been with the company. I think I'm going on like nine years now, but my role is really more of the project side of HR. So I help with performance management training and development, but also our HR systems. So our HRS and then helping optimize our processes and then trying to, you know, make us a little bit more efficient for our employees and move things along. It's me and then my other partner, Tracy, who wasn't able to join. She's also another talent development partner. So we both are kind of the project side of HR. So a little bit more behind the scenes.

ChristenHilborn:
  Thanks. And I'm Kristen, I'm the business systems manager on the it team. So just kind of here to evaluate the tool from the it side, make sure that you know, something that we can integrate. And I know that Randy was invited. We just, we were just on an hour and a half call and just hung up. So he might still join, but be a few minutes late.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  But,

ChristenHilborn:
  we're here more to evaluate the technical side.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay, perfect. No, I appreciate that team and then Nancy, just to understand further. So what are you looking to accomplish with hiver? Are you looking for like a better HR email management tool for like distribution lists? Shared inboxes would love just more insight into that.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Yeah, of course. So this project actually started probably last year. As far as the initiative behind, it was really just to help with automation and streamlining a lot of our process and procedures. And one of the things that we identified was our communication. So we're really looking for a system potentially to help solve with how we receive emails, communication from the company. We get a lot of emails into our various HR inboxes. I think we have about three dedicated HR inboxes, our recruiting inbox, our general HR, and then our talent development one. But our HR admin is the one who's kind of currently responsible for trying to parse through them and get them over to where it is that's supposed to be responding to them. So we're really looking for hopefully for a system where we can have some sort of automation where it would be able to go to the direct person almost like a ticketing, you know, here.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Or frequently asked questions can be answered whether it's through, you know, uploading our handbook. And I apologize if my internet's been a little bit slow today… but be able to help respond a little bit faster. I think our company, we're always moving as quickly as possible. So anything we can do to be able to help our employees get responses a little bit faster from HR is always helpful, but also so that we in HR clearly know who should be getting specific communication so that we can work on getting solutions or resolutions towards those questions as quickly as possible. And then keeping those lines of communication open with us and the employees.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Got it. So you have like three different shared inboxes.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Distribution?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  List where you're getting these like requests from an HR internal perspective and you want like better ways to like route conversations to the right people collaborate and essentially like resolve these queries as they come in.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Yep, exactly. Yeah, because right now it's going through our HR admin who unfortunately has to try and sit there, you know, evaluate the email that comes in determine? Is it, you know, who should it be going to? Sometimes it's not always clear to her which then delays, you know, potential response times or just because we're getting them from different places, right? Sometimes it gets missed. So then it's you know, the employee following up, you know, it's been a day or two since someone's even, you know, advised that they've even received the email, so.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. No, perfect. I think this was super helpful just to gain some more insight into what you're looking to accomplish. So I can share my screen here and jump into, you know, a product demonstration and talk through hiver and how we can help you better manage those shared inboxes. Definitely a very common use case for us. And then in terms of… your email provider, you're using outlook today, right?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Correct. Okay. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Taking a look at my screen here team, you know, what's nice about hiver is we made it a simple yet very effective tool to use from an email management or shared inbox perspective. So you're going to log into this hiver application with your normal Microsoft sso, and you're going to have access to, you know, your personal email communications up top and then below that are those shared inbox communications. So those three different emails that you mentioned Nancy are where we'll kind of manage those right here. So this is a human resources inbox. This is operations inbox, and this is a sales and support inbox. So four different emails that we're you know, organizing in one place and if I'm assigned conversations from multiple inboxes, it'll live up here in the assigned to me section letting like knowing what I have to do and work through in my purview… but going into the, you know, the human resources inbox here, I'm going to click into, you know, that inbox to open up these views. And when you click into the human resources inbox, it opens up some sub views beneath it that helps us manage the intake of communications. So the first is the mind section, everything that's been assigned to me. Then there's the unassigned section, new emails that have hit the mailbox that need to be distributed either manually or through automation. And then there's the team view. So what is everyone in the HR group working on in real time with the status open? And that needs to be completed by user? Want to pause here? Any questions so far?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Is this set up through, I guess like an automation or like AI? Like, I guess, how does it know who to assign? Like is that something that we would be doing on the setup side yeah the implementation piece of it yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Exactly. So we provide customer success managers to our customers to help identify those automations and how to streamline it on your side and the way that we can do that, right? So the first way we can assign work Nancy is manually. So in this case, I'll assign to myself and the team know, I'm going to follow up. The next way is around Robin that will equally distribute it. But it sounds like for what you're looking to do, you'd be looking for the skill based routing. And the way that we can do that is as emails come into the mailbox, we can identify through the subject line or the body of text, certain keywords or phrases. And based on the email type, we identify, we can then choose who to route it for triage and follow up.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Okay. And then is there capabilities to reassign? So say, Linda wants, you know, to be, you know, mindful of vacation and pto and go out for a week or so, do we have the ability to update or reassign things that are with her to the appropriate individuals that would need to, you know, kind of cover for her? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent. So, let's say, I'm in the team view right now, right? Let's say, you… know, matt, matt's going out on pto, he's been working these six conversations, right? I can just select all these and just easily redistribute them to another user.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Okay. And then is there settings that allow for, you know, if there's confidential type, I guess requests that there would be like our HR manager, our senior HR manager most likely would be the one potentially getting that, but we wouldn't want others in the team to have visibility to that like within the system potentially? Okay?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So everything within the shared mailbox is visible? Okay, team members that's kind of like the foundation of our shared inboxes.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Okay. So it'd be up to her to just, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  But, if they're not like as long as people are just focusing on what they're working with. Like there's no reason for them to like go off and look at that other communication cause it's not assigned to them. You know what I mean? So, most cases like team members are kind of just staying within their Lane.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Okay. Is that based off of our permissions currently in our outlook. So right now, only select members have access to the general HR inbox. And same with our recruiting inbox, would they only be able to see what they have access to in their outlook inbox? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, totally up to you who has access to what inbox, right? So, if I'm just a part of the human resources inbox, I can just only have visibility into this and I won't be able to see into the operations sales or support. So in terms of visibility into certain mailboxes, yes, we do have that possibility to either hide communications from certain people or make them privy to it if they are part of the team that's within that mailbox, okay?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Yeah. And then, what about non inboxes that are more like group setups? I think we have a few where it's like the HR operations team, and it's a group email… address, but it's not necessarily an inbox.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, it's like a distribution list type thing. Yeah, that we work with that as well. Okay? And we would treat it as like a shared mailbox. Okay? So those are the different ways we can route and kind of decide who has access to what. And then we're kind of tracking the status also, right? Whether it's open pending or closed, ensuring nothing slips between the cracks, and that we're working through these HR requests to a resolution. We can add those tags for organizational purposes. Really helpful for triaging and putting certain conversations in buckets, folders or views. We can also leverage these tags to provide analytics on the backend, to understand the common request types our team is facing over a certain time period.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  And are these tags customizable?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep, exactly totally customizable. So, you know, you could have it like payroll requests, you could have it, you know, maybe, you know, benefits requests, whatever it might be. You could have these different tags to organize them. Okay? And then the collaborative aspect. So being able to collaborate internally with people when you need insight in the communication, I'm going to send this notification to matt he'll, receive that notification. Top left, right here. He can then click on it. It'll take him right to this thread where we can kind of keep having that back and forth, you know, dialogue, but maybe we need more information to respond, right? We don't have, you know, the proper information we need. We can also leverage our AI co pilot which can search through your internal HR resources, whether it's like PDFS, word, docs, whatever documentation it might be to help streamline responses for your team. So we know sometimes it can be like really hard and cumbersome to find that information. So this co pilot can help search and sift through it for you to enable your team for more efficient and effective responses. So.

ChristenHilborn:
  I assume like that co pilot and stuff that data remains secure and as long as it's not shared with any other companies or if your customers are yours.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep, that's correct. So this is all within a closed environment within your specific environment itself. We're not like leveraging your data in that way at all. Yeah. So right here, we're able to, you know, draft this reply with our co pilot, find that information effectively. And then I have the ability to, you know, send and close the conversation, send it pending send, closing on a sign or… maybe create shared draft where I want to, you know, share it with another person on the HR team to be like, hey, is this okay to send? But I want to pause right here, Nancy and Kristen. Like what are your thoughts on this so far?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  I mean, so far? Yeah, go ahead Kristen.

ChristenHilborn:
  I have no background or I knew nothing about you guys when we ended this. So I guess for me, it looks like it just overlays our existing Microsoft outlook and then adds some functionality for tracking and tagging and that kind of stuff. Is that correct? Understanding what your guys tool is?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yep. Exactly. We're you know, shared inbox distribution list management, helping with tracking, analytics, streamlining, responses, assignments, and delegation, and things along those lines.

ChristenHilborn:
  And what, how do you guys connect to our environment? Like, so I'm assuming that there's no apis or anything needed since you're overlaying our outlook. But what's the connectivity and how's that work?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So you just have to sign in with your Microsoft accounts. And as you can see like those different email inboxes that we have like the finance, human resource operations, sales support. There are these different email addresses right here, and these different account types, you know, distribution lists, Microsoft three six, five groups, outlook, shared mailbox. So we can connect these different Microsoft accounts. All you have to do is authenticate and log in. Okay. But what are your, what are your thoughts? Nancy? Is this like, is this in line for what you'd be looking for a shared inbox or email solution?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Potentially, how does it, I guess on the reporting and kind of being able to manage the requests as they're coming in? Yeah, I think I'd want to see a little bit of that just so that we're able to understand, you know, obviously we want to make sure we're responding in a timely manner. But if we're noticing, you know, a team member is lagging or behind, be able to see where those cases may be coming from. And it could be, you know, something as simple as it's just a type of request or if we start seeing a pattern where requests are getting, you know, not responded to as quickly as we would like. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  100 percent. Hey, Randy. How are you?

Randy F:
  Doing good. Sorry, I'm late, no.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  All good. We were just hopping into the analytics section… but taking a look at the analytics here. So let's take a look, let's say at the last 90 days, right? You can choose which data range you want to see, which mailbox you want to report on. Let's take a look at the support one.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  For this example. So here we can see active new resolve conversations over the time period. You know, what that workload looked like over the 90 days, what our average first response time was as a team, our average resolution times, making sure we're providing good service, good metrics and then breaking it down individually. So how many emails have been assigned per user? How many emails have been sent out per user? And what are their individual performance metrics from an average first response or average resolution time? So it's taking me 493 hours to respond to an email when it gets assigned to me?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  I'm probably going to be in trouble on Wednesday… and then identifying the tags. So why are people reaching out? You know, based on active new resolve conversations, what are the trends and themes we're seeing that the HR team is receiving on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. So are we receiving a lot of benefits requests? Are we receiving a lot of payroll, you know, complaints like whatever it might be, and then also breaking down the performance of those tags. So which request types are bogging down our time? Where are we spending most of our efforts when these requests are coming in? So just a good way to identify bottlenecks, trends, to maybe streamline some internal operations. Is there anything else Nancy that you would want to see from a analytics perspective?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  I'm sure there is. I just can't think of it right now. I think this definitely helps just be able to know that there is a way to… assess I guess the timeliness and be able to identify based on the tags. Yeah, just the way we could just start seeing like where the patterns are and be able to build out down the road expectations surrounding, you know, specific topics that we typically get within HR. And we know that there are some responses where it's just going to take a little bit to get the final resolution. But being able to know that there's you know, a response somehow, is there a way to identify like when there's an initial response versus like we've finalized it. So maybe we've responded to the person like we're looking into it. Thanks for, you know, letting us know, but we actually haven't resolved their inquiry. So.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  That would be our average first response time. Like how long does it take us to respond when that request comes in for that first email?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Okay. And is there a way to set up any type of automations where we can have, I know you said that we can upload like our handbook or PDFS, but something that just like is able to say like if we get this type of email, we can, you know, respond in this manner here's kind of like a templated way to respond to. We sometimes get requests like especially from an HR perspective, we get requests from independent contractors or drivers. They don't actually go to HR. We in HR don't ever interact with any of our contract workers. So often we're trying to tell them where to go to, who they actually should be reaching out to… yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So we can create some automations actually maybe streamline some responses. So your team doesn't have to like manually respond every time. So we can create like automations where it's like, you know, new conversations received. Let's say in the subject line, it contains the keyword like payroll. Sorry, I can't type today since we've identified that this is a payroll request and we can keep drilling down into these conditions, right? We can search through the body of text for information. So maybe we want to double down on that as well, you know, but we can keep typing out these words to identify that request site that came in since we know this is a payroll benefits request, whatever it might be. We're going to send an automated reply being like, hey here's some information like maybe reach out to these people X y Z. So this is an example of where this certain request type came in and we're actually able to send a customized reply proactively without your team having to send out that message.

Randy F:
  Nancy, is that what you're getting at? Or were you trying to get the other direction? Where like if a driver, a contract driver sends something to HR and says, my gosh, I need help with my, you know, please update my insurance information or where's my paycheck right? Which is not obviously not valid for a driver, right? They don't I will Cole, you may notice that we deal with there's like Nancy said, right there's that hard line between someone who's a contractor and someone who is an employee, right? And we try and keep that very distinct. But the drivers on the other side don't necessarily have or keep that same distinction as solid as we do or we try to anyway. So they will use terms like payroll or paycheck that really, does not apply or, you know, to them because it's right?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Yeah, it's incorrect terminology on their end.

Randy F:
  Yeah. And it's remittance for, you know, the delivery service, right?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. In that case, you could use an automation where it's like, you know, if you receive an email that doesn't contain your domain, right? Then you can send a certain customized reply to them. So again, building those conditions, you know, since they're not a part of your internal company, they're not going to have your domain. So you've identified, they don't have, you know, your specific domain and maybe they reached out about this specific subject, then let's send a customized email to them, whatever. That might be perfect. Perfect. I.

Randy F:
  Saw also, sorry, I saw also in there, you had some, you had some mailboxes listed. Can you jump back to that real quick? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, totally.

Randy F:
  So distro… or group shared mailbox outlook user account? Okay? I saw… this and it prompted the question. Does this maintain the content of those mailboxes as well? It's.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  a read write integration into Microsoft. So what we update in hiver will update Microsoft and vice versa. And I have a whole security page as well. That kind of goes into the integration in depth that I could send, you know, to you, Randy and Kristen after for further, you know.

Randy F:
  Okay. To that. Yeah. And I'm thinking about how some of the content in there is kept, right? As an example, if we had a mailbox that literally said human resources at gouspack. Com and this was acting within that mailbox, is it doing the cleanup as well? So that for example, a mailbox doesn't fill up?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  So, is it doing the cleanup as well on the outlook side? Yeah. So that's whatever is happening in the source account like that's something that like we're not touching, we're just mirroring what's happening within hiver. The cleanup will have to remain on the outlook side.

Randy F:
  Okay. So also tagging along that if the HR group is in there and starts operating out of the mailbox as well, like they do right now, how does the system keep that separate or?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. If someone sent an email within like the source account, the outlook mailbox, it would be reflected in hiver as well?

Randy F:
  It would be it.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Would be, yeah, because we have a read write integration.

Randy F:
  Okay. I.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  know, we are coming up on time here team. We also do offer, you know, what we typically recommend as a next step, we do offer a free trial to test this for two weeks. We could get like some HR people on board, you know, set up the mailboxes, start testing automations and all that stuff. What are your thoughts on setting that up for a potential next step, right?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Now, we are in just the early stages. We still have to present to our HR leadership and potentially our executive leadership team to be able to move forward.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  So, I think for us, it's really just getting as much detail as possible, understanding what the timeline is for like an implementation of it. And then if you have any details on what the cost would look like even if it's just estimations so that we can be able to better present for our case of potentially being able to add this to our budget essentially. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So implementation is typically one to two weeks. Oh, that's really good. Yeah, it's a pretty straightforward process we would provide you and I can send you some more information after this, a dedicated customer success manager who would provide like team training, implementation services and the whole nine yards. So it's a totally white glove experience. And then in terms of how many people would be using this at the company?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  As far as like the ones managing, yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  People managing the emails, who would need access to a tool like this?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  I mean, the HR team, I'm not sure if we would need all of them. So I think as a whole, we are, we keep changing. Let me try to see how big we are. Now, we used to be nine. I feel like we're a lot less now.

Randy F:
  I was going to just comment, right? Like, I mean, Nancy, if we're looking at this.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  It's probably like at least three.

Randy F:
  We can probably just say 10.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Like 10 people. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Yeah. So it would, for an annual commitment, the per user cost is 65 dollars per user per month.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  And then in terms of kind of your, is that?

Randy F:
  On, I'm sorry, I… was real quick looking over the pricing stuff because I did have another question as well which plan or plans support sso and integration with azure active directory?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Which plan? I don't know if we have the integration with sso with azure active directory. I'd have to reach back out to my technical team on that. I know we do have like Microsoft sso, you'd just be logging in with those credentials, but let me double check on that one as well.

Randy F:
  Okay. And okay. Okay. What I'm seeing on the website is that you guys do support sso integration with? Okta. Yeah, but that's for the elite plan. Is that the only one that does that? Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  From my knowledge, we only have an sso integration with Okta. But I think because the way we're set up with our Microsoft sso with our Omni solution, I just need to find out more information on what that azure might look like. Is that an absolute need to have.

Randy F:
  We, so sso integration is almost a requirement. Yes.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Okay. So let me get some insight on that and I can bring back my feedback. Okay? But when would be a good time teams to touch base to see how your internal conversations go and about potentially kicking off a trial?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  So we are still in the early stages. I would imagine we're not going to be looking to implement anything during Q1. We unfortunately have a couple of high priority… system items that are in need of our attention at the moment. But probably during Q2 is when we're realistically would be looking if we get approval. So probably over the next few weeks, we'll look to present all of our findings… but I would love to stay in touch maybe like on a biweekly or monthly basis just to let you know where we are once we get all the information. But I would say probably not until Q2 would be when we would realistically be able to even move forward just because of some of the other priorities we currently have going on. But we just wanted to get our early start on some of the research so we know what direction we possibly could go into if we do get it approved.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. So probably like may timeframe is more realistic for?

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Yeah, yeah. If we can do it sooner, we absolutely will.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  But I know that we have at least two priority projects that are time bound through at least April that are going to be taking up a lot of our time hands on deck in HR. Yeah.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  No worries. Totally understand that. So I can just, I'll send over an invite for like three weeks out to have like a touch base?

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  We can always go further if need be. But I'll follow up with like this call recording some more information so you have it and can present it. And then we'll just kind of go from there.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Nope. That sounds perfect. Thank you so much.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Yeah, no, it's great to meet you all. I will follow up shortly. I hope everyone has a great rest of their week and talk to you all soon.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Of course. Enjoy the rest of your week, Cole. Thank you all.

Cole Miller (cole@grexit.com):
  Right. See you guys, thanks.

Nancy Devine (nancy.devine@gouspack.com):
  Thanks, Randy. Thanks Kristen.
