================================================================================

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  yeah. There's a background noise at your end. I mean, yeah. Okay. All right. Fair enough. Let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Rakesh. And I take care of sales at hiver for the UK as well as european territory. So I'll be the point of contact, run the show today. I've been with the company for over four years, have personally onboarded more than 500 teams. So I'll let you know if this is a good solution towards the end of the conversation after we look at your requirements and everything in detail.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Yeah. All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Now, to begin with, Abby, do you want to first of all, tell me what made you look at hiver? What are you searching for?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  So, currently, we have a team about four or five people on two different email addresses dealing with customer service. We have two different like spheres that people are emailing for, but we're looking to combine the inbox because they overlap quite a lot into one email, that our customers can email that email, and we can allocate it internally and deal with it much more efficiently because at the moment, we don't have any email organisation system apart from sort of handling labelling emails and things like that. And we just need a system in place so that we can get back to our customers.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Currently, do you have one inbox or multiple inbox for customer queries?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Multiple? Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Do you want to give me an illustration on what all different mailboxes do you have? I mean, just for my visualization, yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Yeah. So we have the community. So we're a members club. We have community which looks after the lenders website inside the club. So with queries about hosting events, you know, similar things. We have memberships that's from prospective members, people wanting to deal with the payments. And then there's also just a lot of other emails floating around like accounts reception events, but we're looking to combine community and membership because we already have an overlap.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  We basically want community and membership as one mailbox and payments and accounts could actually club into one. And we call it finance maybe or something like.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, that's outside of my remit, I'm looking personally just at community and memberships. Now. Okay. That's all, I kind of have the scope to be at the moment. We also have an app… which has sort of a private messaging function and we're getting a lot of inquiries through that as well, which is having the same issue of it's not being sort of tracked and it's very much instead of there being a community profile on the app, it's individual staff members. So queries are going to a staff member and then being dropped and it's just a lot of work that needs to be done.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. And, and these queries which have been dropped today, I mean before, because we don't have a solution which should give us a good idea on how many queries are coming in, which representative is actually taking care of all of that. Where are these coming in from today? You said these are coming from direct customers, right? Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Yeah. Are.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  these coming into a definite email address today or individuals in their personal inboxes. So.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  We have my individual email, my manager's individual inbox, the community inbox, the membership inbox, each of the membership teams inboxes. And on the app, we have my profile and my manager's profile, which people send queries? Okay? All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right now, with regards to these emails or the requests that are coming into the app, are these also going to go to your outlook interface today? I mean, do they go there or not?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  No, no, they don't but if there is some sort of system that we can like combine all of them into one sort of software that would be fantastic. But I'm not sure our app is very new. So I'm not sure yet if we have those capabilities.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. And this is a mobile app you're referring to, right? Yes.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Yeah, the dots.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Got it. Now. Could you tell me how many emails otherwise do we receive today in community at the rate inbox and membership at the rate inbox versus the regular, you know, queries that we receive in the app today? Is there, any number?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  I don't know for membership. I don't have access to them inbox, but from outside members probably a day. And then internal, we also get all of our internal emails to those same inboxes. So we're having to filter out members versus colleagues understood. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. Okay. Fair enough. Now, any specific reason we started to look out for a solution today because I'm assuming you've been working the way it has been happening for you traditionally, heaven must have fallen apart today. But, what happened recently that you started looking for a solution?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Well, I just started and this is like my project, okay, sort out everything.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood understood. And have you guys, you know, prepared for a budgeting, on this project or I'm.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  doing research at the moment of like different systems and providers and I'm gonna relate that and bring that to my manager.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Got it. So basically, this is much in your discovery phase. Now, we're not budgeted as such, but if you happen to like the solution, the value proposition, you've done all the tick boxes you're saying you're going to be talking to your boss who's going to be the ultimate decision maker, and then we'll talk about the pricing and budgets as well. Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Okay.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  And given that, if you happen to find a solution, I mean, when soon are you looking to recommend it internally and make a decision hopefully?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Within the next few weeks?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. Yeah. Apart from the emails that you received today, is there any other mode of communication through which you could receive customer requests?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Well, in the app, like I.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Mentioned, okay. Yeah, fair enough. Emails and app are two mode of communication. Do you guys get phone calls by any chance? Any chats on the website or?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Yeah, we don't have chat on the website, but we do get phone calls but not specifically my team as such.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. All right. So, we are only concerned about the emails and the apps, the chats in the app that we received today, the queries on the app. Okay. Fair enough. Very clear. Anything in particular, you want me to be aware of your current solution and your requirements other than what we discussed today, and then I will walk you through the hiver platform in action. I.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Don't think so. We're really just looking to organize streamlines, you know, experience. So when people ask for help, they gotta sure.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries at all. What I'm gonna do is maybe share my screen, quickly, walk you through what hiver has to offer, and then we take all the questions for you towards the end of the conversation as well.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Yeah, that's great.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right, great. If you notice, I am logged in into app hiver, this is hiver interface and I'm using my outlook credentials, these are my test logins from outlook. So basically for hiver, everybody need to log in into their individual hiver accounts, authenticating with their existing outlook logins. We don't have to create their new logins at all. Yeah. And like you mentioned in the membership inbox as well as your, you know, main inbox, how many members did you say you're going to be having to manage these requests today?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Four to five, four.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  To five folks. So all I'm saying is, do we all four to five folks have individual logins on outlook today? Yeah, understood. So all they need to do is just simply log in into hiver using their existing outlook credentials? Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Once.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  they're logged in. They have their access to the personal inbox on the top. So these personal emails are very much private to each individual and these are not shared amongst anybody in the team. These are private. Like how you today work on your outlook interface on your personal inbox emails. These are exactly the same emails at the same time. If you notice I have these multiple shared mailboxes set up here. Now, these are exactly the same mailboxes that you're going to be using and we will set it up under membership inbox, and for your different clients inbox. Like you can have these two mailboxes connected today to your existing outlook, right inside your hiver interface. Now, basically all your membership emails will start to land inside this membership folder. Now, imagine when everybody log into their hiver account with their outlook logins, they have access to one membership inbox, another second inbox and looking at a complete transparency and visibility, they have access to all new brand new requests coming into unassigned bucket hill. So unassigned would be the new requests. You understand what the request is all about. Look at the email, read through it and from the activity panel. And here from the activity panel, you have the assignment who has to work on this ticket from your team. You assign the ownership status by default is open, which meaning somebody has to work on it and we are not yet closing it, then you have pending and closed. Also once you are done with the resolution, you mark it closed. And otherwise you keep that in pending. These tags will help you categorize whether these are new customers, these are registered customers. These are memberships. These are the requests about escalation, something to do with donation or whatever. So these are going to be different category of requests that you can use the tags on. There is the email priority. All of these are custom fields by the way you can use it the way you want it. I am using it for customer priority. What is the type of email? Like different type of emails that we receive today? And within the same email. When I need to talk to my other colleagues? I would just go ahead and use this collaboration functionality where I can talk to my colleagues and say, hey, Cole, can you help me with this one? And I don't have to forward emails to each other as such at all? Yeah. Okay. Now, once I assign email to myself, if you notice unassigned drop down by zero. And now in mine section, I have got these four emails that I need to work on for a day. So these are my tasks, my emails that I need to work on and every email. If you notice has little tags on top of it, which talks about what this email is about, and you can manage tags the way you want because tags are shared amongst everybody in the team. These are the, you know, resolution time, the slas that we are running. Not sure if these are sensitive emails that you receive today, but if you do, we can always set up, the first response time, the resolution time and all of that would actually function the way you want today. So this will actually trigger when soon do you want to reply to these emails for the first time? And, when you close the emails, how long do you have to close this email? Like how many, within, how many hours or minutes you want to close? That. Now, when I'm replying to a customer request, I can choose to reply from my membership email address or my personal email address, which then everybody in your team can have their individual signatures at the bottom. You've got email templates for repetitive nature of queries right here, which can be managed and shared amongst everybody in the team. Then also for the customer support email inquiries, you can even have a customer satisfaction report like a quick snippet at the bottom asking for how happy they are, the level of support. And in case I need to maybe share a draft with my colleague because I want my colleague to simply go ahead and further edit the draft and reply to the customer. I can go ahead and save the draft. I've mentioned my colleague. They would go ahead, get an option to make further changes to the draft, be the owner of the ticket, and then they can actually go ahead and send the email to the customers. All right, apart from it, let's say if I'm replying to this customer, because I'm done with the resolution, I can go ahead and reply to this customer and close the ticket, which means I'm resolving this inquiry and all the closed emails will then move to the closed bucket and everybody in your team will have access to all the ones that are already done for your team. Yeah, by default, if there is a reply from the customer, it opens up again in the mind section that's when I keep looking at the loop and I would see the same email is reopened by hiver. Again automatically, there is a new reply from the customers. Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  For.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  you, Abby, if you want to find out how many total requests are opened up which are allocated to people which are assigned to team, but you want to know how many users are working on what sort of requests, you simply go to the team section here and look at the total eight tickets. And out of it, these are already allocated to multiple folks. These are the delegated tasks. Already. If you notice Rakesh has three emails, Cole has one email, Alice is working on one email. And in case Yukta takes a day off and she's already working on one, you can go ahead and say, Rakesh, can you take this up because she's on a day off today, and that's how you have the complete visibility on the team tasks been assigned to them. Yeah, any email you want to look at in pending because you want to work on these pending requests later, maybe think of any cancellation of membership and you want to process the refund for them. These refunds would happen on Fridays. So I can just simply go ahead and put those emails into pending state, use the tag as to these are invoices. And all of that and pending requests can be tracked right from the pending section. Here. It would also tell you which representative is the owner on these pending requests. And that's how you can pretty much manage all the emails coming into your membership and your customer support phasing in phasing, and,

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  would we be able to link the admin to that? Or would that not work?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Now, if I were to be very candid at the moment, we don't have an option to link the app communication, right in the hybrid interface, but I would like to understand if there is a way if these emails are coming into your app today, can these be forwarded to your, any of your customer success mailbox from within the app interface. If these emails could be forwarded to a customer service inbox, then the same folks can actually start a reply from within hybrid interface.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Yeah, I don't think we have that at the moment. It's very much a sort of like Instagram style direct messaging.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it. We do have an application on mobile which will serve exactly the same motive of managing your membership emails. But I'm concerned about the ones which are getting into your app directly. So people I'm assuming would log into the app and that's when they reply to these conversations, if I'm getting it, right? Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Do you mind if I check this from my support team and maybe write you an email, how can we are the requests coming into the app today? Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  That's fine. I think if that's not something we can do even just having us a bit more organized is helpful. I also wanted to ask, do you do sort of if we were to put a form on our website where self categorize their query and that sort of came through? Is that something that you guys do as well? Could.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  you repeat that? I mean I missed, your voice is little feeble. Can you repeat that please?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Yeah. So if we put a form on our website, so instead of contact us with emails, it had a form instead with a drop down of categories of, you know, different things, that we deal with and urgency.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  And then that came forward and through entire email. Is that something that you guys are able to help set up? I?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Mean, do you have the phone already set up or do you want hiver to help you set it up?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  No worries. What you can do in hiver is absolutely, you go ahead and set up a knowledge base which will be more of a self help portal, a self help portal, just like how we have helped dot hiver.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I'll just give you a quick example and then it'll be exact replica of it for your customers or your internal customers as well. Now, this will be a health documentation, a portal where anybody can actually go log in and maybe help themselves like try and find answers to anything with regards to whatever they require, right? If they don't happen to find any information that's when we can go ahead and help you customize the form instead of chat with us, you can always say, click here for support and you can add a form to your knowledge base. Now, the same support portal, you can even have a form like what is your name, email subject, describe your, you know, specific query. And then we have a quick drop down as well, like what query is it about? And all of that, now this contact form actually creates a ticket that's that lands inside the same membership inbox for you guys. So there is a way just not through your support portal. But even if you click on chat with us. This can also help your internal folks to submit a request. Even the chat bubble can be customized in a way that you're asking for certain specific information and that this could be forwarded to your chat folder. And if your team is unavailable, this could actually create a.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  I don't think we'll be doing a chat because the whole thing is that it's very sort of personalized. Yeah, yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Then in that case, adding a form.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Automation adding?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  A form here would actually help. So, I think you can add a form on the knowledge base and this creates a ticket in the same membership inbox or your customer success inbox. Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Cool. All.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Right. And apart from it, like you mentioned, there are emails which are coming in internally from your teams versus the external customers for memberships. You always have an option in hiver from the admin panel to categorize these emails. Yesterday. For an example, I go into your membership inbox screenshot, and I create an automation workflow. And Paloma replied today, you're five minutes. Now, when I create an automation workflow, I would say any email which is coming in from your company… this domain always can categorize the emails and see a tag. This is actually internal clients or these are the company customers. And then you can even choose to route the internal requests to a specific representative who doesn't have to take care of the external customers. So that's how you can automatically categorize emails on basis of your company domain. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right. Anything else in particular you're looking to achieve over the solution like this?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  I don't think so. I think what we're really after is sort of what you've covered already, which is that assigning and communicating without having to forward things around and sort of keeping track on what's been dealt with and what hasn't.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Sure. If you look at the analytics, this will actually give you, a good view of what's happening in your inboxes for your membership inbox versus your customer success inbox, you get an option to simply look at the active new result. Emails, go ahead and start the date range. Let's say you want to look at what last quarter had had been so far for you. So you have got the workload report and you've got report about the performance for the entire team, how long we take to respond, resolve, assign tickets to each other. Now, one step down the line, I want to know what my users are doing. So that's when I can go into the reports for emails assigned versus emails sent and all of that particularly, you want to find out what Rakesh is up to in last three day months. So you will be able to see the performance report right here. So again, different category of emails you receive today, you can automatically tag those emails and you can see how many of them are account receivables, new customer requests, billing, requests, and devices. All of that is pretty much possible here as well. Yeah. And… then the emails which are missed, you get a report on the slas, and the ones where you choose to run the customer satisfaction, you want to find out how many happy membership customers and sad and everything. You've got the entire details right here. Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  So, how do you set up your slas? Sorry, could?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You repeat it?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  How do you, how do slas work?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Okay. Now, for the slas to set up, when you're into the admin panel in your membership inbox, you get an option to set this, set the SLA up. So when you create a policy, it's a straightforward process of setting up the first response time.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Let's say you want to do four hours response time, two emails. And then for the resolution which is from open to close these emails, you want to happen, you want to do that in no more than 24 hours. So that's how you go ahead and set up the slas. And whoever you want to notify if these are breached, you have an option to put in your email address, your boss's email inbox address or all of that. So this is more to do with the notifications that's how you go ahead and set up the slas in your inbox, and you give their name, which whatever slas like general slas or whatever. You also have an option to set up multiple slas. For an example, your existing emails, I mean, emails coming in from your existing customers versus the new customers or emails which are absolutely with regards to the escalations, you can even go ahead and say these are important emails. They don't need to wait for say four hours. It should be dealt in no more than 30 minutes. So you can have multiple such slas, meaning you're treating every important emails differently than the regular emails. You can have two different slas running as well. Yeah, sounds.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Good. All right.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Anything else in particular, if we are missing on anything? I?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Don't think so. If you could just talk me through the pricing and the different tiers that would be.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Good, sure. Absolutely. And with regards to the app conversations that you're managing today, Abby, do you want to tell me how urgent is that? Like is that absolutely a showstopper because you want to manage the emails as well as the app conversations from within one interface or are we still okay to manage emails in hiver or different forms in hiver and app communications can still, you know, flow through apps. What are your thoughts on?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  It, I think we really need to our emails and the apps, you know, if that could work as well. That would be great. But it's not, you know, a necessity for us right now?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Understood. Okay. Now, if you notice we have got two options here, growth and pro. I'll let you choose the difference here. If you're only looking to manage the customer satisfaction, the happy sad, neutral customers at the bottom of the email snippet, if you require it, we're looking at this package. Otherwise, we are absolutely okay with this growth one because it will still give you the slas, you have got the automations you've got. Otherwise, you know, different sort of workflows, you have the reports and everything possible into the growth plan as well. Now, this can actually give you a non boring assistance. You can help set up three different mailboxes. We are only looking at two for now and you can have five folks right into this inbox for growth packets which is 25 multiplied by five users by 12. This is going to be the annual subscription of no more than 1,500 dollars a year.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Do you have that in pounds?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  I mean, we only bill in usd, but if you want, I can go ahead and translate that. Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  I mean, it would just be a bit under winter.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  That's going to be, see around. Let me quickly check how much would that be? XC? Com. Thank you.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  About 20 pounds. Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  So, if you're looking at around 25 dollars, that's going to be for.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  the future, right? Yeah.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  19 point nine nine. So for a month, that's going to be 125, and then you're looking at around, yeah, less than 100 pounds a month actually. And.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  What are the significant differences between the three versions in the first?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Yeah. So basically free version does not have tags. You don't have slas or automations, you simply have one email inbox management, something like membership at the rate inbox. But if you were looking at two different inboxes to manage, we have to look at a paid plan. Other than that, you won't have any support on setting it up. You won't have access to the onboarding assistance as such, like we can still give you a guide. You have a 24 seven technical support. But this is for the teams that are just starting off, they don't have a solution, but they don't even care about the reports, analytics, SLA automations and all of that. So, yeah, but you always have an option to start from free, move on to the paid plan without any challenges as such. Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Okay. I think I can bring this in.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Fair enough. And in the meanwhile, I'm going to be talking about the management of your app in app messages that you receive today, if there is a way for us to manage it in hiver interface, if not, would that be like a show stopper for you? Just want to make sure that I update my records and talk to my team accordingly. Yeah.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  I mean, not really. I am looking at sort of other providers and sort of figuring out different options. I'm actually saying very much on the discovery side of this, so.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Got it.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  And.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  what all different solution providers are you looking at? Maybe I can help you with some comparison charts and.

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  I, I'm… doing more research today. ServiceNow is one of them which I've been recommended also Hubspot, and just a couple of other things. Okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  Did you say Zendesk? Sorry, sorry. Did you say Zendesk? Did I, hear it, right?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  Zendesk? Yeah, I've looked into that. But as I say, I'm very much at the start of this, okay?

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  All right, Abby. Thank you so very much. Yeah, I mean, yeah, allow me some time to talk to my support team and get you information about the in app messages. Other than that. When are you scheduled to speak to your boss about, the product evaluation?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  I'd like it to be end of this week, got.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  It, and would that be okay if we reconnect for about 10 minutes next week and see where do we stand today in terms of the evaluation?

Abigail WIlliam-Powlett (abigailwp@theconduit.com):
  I will. Sorry, could.

Rakesh Goyal (rakesh@grexit.com):
  You repeat that again?
