Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  hello, Ryan. Hey… good morning. Good afternoon.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  What time is it? I don't know afternoon. Good evening for you. Yeah, I'm.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  always confused on who's based on est, who's based on PST. So, it's like I'm meeting a PST client and I'm like good morning and then on est, I'm like good afternoon. So it's just funny.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  You know, I just say whatever it is. Yeah, good morning. Good afternoon. Good night, right? Whatever.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, makes sense. I was just curious like, did you get a chance to try out? AI? Yeah, I.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  was dabbling in it, you know, I did see some of the features pop up.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  To.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  be honest, I wasn't using it a lot… you know, with the, you know, with the faces and the co pilot and stuff like that. I would like it more for like a resource to use instead of having it write things for, you know, employees and people I don't want. I just don't want us to start getting into that sounding too robotic, I guess.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah. Like, which were the like, which were the most like which were the features you actually tried and you thought could make sense?

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  One of the things is like, you know, because I'm using it or, you know, I should say that I feel like I'm writing an email or something that you could use it. I feel like the options are a little hidden. So I kind of forget about them.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  What I kind of would like to see it used for and kind of how it would be implemented is like, hey, you know, it reads an email coming in and say, hey, listen, there's been other responses. I know this is kind of like the knowledge base and all that, but, you know, having almost like a pop up or suggestions saying, hey, listen, this question has already been answered here was what was written before here's? A template that was used or here is the template you can use. Again, I just feel like it's not kind of readily available right there. So I always forget about it… and I just end up using other methods to write an email or anything like that.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  OK. So I hear you. I mean the things that you mentioned right now, hiver has the capability. I was just going to say that I use template suggestions a lot and like automated responses are not like say, I'm not sure if you have that turned on. If you have that basically turned on in the background is when it starts showing, you say you have emailed me today saying, hey, I'm busy today. Can we move this call to Monday next week? And so in my hiver, I would see three responses, suggestive responses and I can basically choose between those three AI suggestions. And then the email is written for me. So, and that's basically with respect to, the things that I write like, I don't have any active templates. When you have active templates, you would have AI active like template suggestions, but like I don't have any templates. So based on how I respond to my customers, it suggests me this content piece that I can use to like respond to the customers. Like see, this is very bare minimum. But I am like when I talk to customers like, hey, we use AI tagging or copilot, and I'm like, no, I use AI compose the most which is so lame here. But then I think that's like saving a lot of my time. At least like every time there's like 10 emails, I've come back after the weekend. And on Mondays the emails are like flooded. I would just go after one email. And then I would just take the suggestive responses and send them. And if I have to basically like proactively reach out or like email anyone, I just suggest the AI three words like literally if I'm having a conversation with you and I want the AI to give a follow up email, I would just type follow up email, three words that's it. And the AI is going to basically write that response. So.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  OK. So maybe I'm using it wrong then because yeah, when I click on, it just says like right now I'm just trying it and it says, OK, I'm going to say AI compose, make it short and it says, email body is empty. So I have to actually start writing something and then do you use AI compose?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Can you just share me your screen? I can.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Share?

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  So, like if I do AI compose?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  OK. No, I understood. So basically, can you just delete this? Yeah, and then try reply all like just click on reply. All. OK. So now you see, help me write the one that says, help me write, just click on it. Yes, and write response to this email… response. Yeah, create on the right? Yes.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Gotcha. OK. So this, OK, so then, OK.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  So that the one that you're showing is basically when you type something and then you want to make it like say, I'm a person, I was like with respect to this email, I'm like, OK, good to know about that. That's it that's what I wrote. And then I basically go into AI compose and I say make it empathetic, and it's going to be like, hey, I really appreciate you letting me know about this.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  All right. Maybe I'm using this wrong then? Okay?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Huh. Yeah, I can basically do it.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Why do I have to do this? Okay?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  I keep on using it wrong. I would say it's you're halfway using it wrong? Halfway. Some things are not turned on in the background like I don't see you getting any suggestions like I do. I'm going to show you how I see the suggestions. Give me one second. I'll just find the email where I've not responded.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Yeah, because it would be because there's like, you know, we get like customer emails that have been answered time and time again, and it's like, yeah, you can go to this email template here. We do have templates but it's like, you know, I could search it and like I,

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  don't know. Yeah. I mean, that still is time taking, I mean, in order to respond to different emails, going through email templates and putting, it still is time consuming. I think this should be really helpful. Okay?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  I'm just going to find an email. My system is really slow. So just bear with it. Awesome. Okay?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Okay.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Okay. I found one email… just.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  I'm going to show you like this is my personal email. And OK, no wonder it's so slow because all of my tabs are.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  I will get that organized this week. I have plans to do it. But, yeah. So basically, this is one email and this is like Raghav has sent an email to one of our customers with respect to what their options look like. And so this is something that I see now like these are the three options that I see. So if I'm like right now, OK, I'll just hover over it and then I have responses.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  All right. I do like, I see those but mine look a little different and they're just kind of simple little.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, that's the Gmail feature. I think you're talking about where it says like, OK, no problem. Sure. That works like.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Yeah. That's useless to me.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. OK. Yeah, that's Gmail basically. So this is like, OK, this email, it has not a lot of information but say you are writing to me saying, hey, Sonali. I am, I'm curious what the renewal options are and like things like that where it's more like there's more content for me to write. It's. Basically also going to write like long emails wherein all of the contacts are mentioned and it's basically picking this up from my past responses. So it's going to suggest something based on that. Like I find this the most useful with respect to saving time on a day to day level.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Yeah. I mean, that sounds great. Do I not have that turned on? Is that what it is?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I think it's not turned on for you. That's what I can like, just try sharing your screen. Yeah, go into admin panel. I can quickly also take you through shared inboxes. Yeah… I'm going to one of the most used shared inboxes. OK. Go into AI… AI co pilot. OK, AI compose is turned on for you. It should ideally be showing you these suggestions on AI compose, but if it's not, I can ask the support team about this and they can maybe get that enabled for you. It should. Did you turn that on today? Because?

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  No, I didn't first say anything.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  OK. Then it should be showing. I'm going to, after this call, I'm going to raise it to the support team and see what are they saying? But, yeah, that's pretty much about the AI compose piece. If I have to. Like if I have to give you an idea here. AI summarizer is the one that would pop up on the top that summarizes the email. And then compose is the one we just saw right now. Compose is like comprises of two parts. The one that like has suggested AI templates that you get. And the other one is to make it empathetic, correct the grammar, improve writing, the suggestions that you saw. And yeah, ask AI is something I think we spoke about last time which is, yeah, I have a.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  few things in there. Yeah, it says, I definitely, you know, the idea of this is great, right? It's here's, all the information. I guess I just don't really kind of in my daily tasks going around, I don't really see it popping up, I guess or maybe it's because I'm not getting those little blurbs, yeah.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I think once you turn it on, it should show up but it's going to show up for all the users. Oh,

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  I see this is, oh, I'll turn it off.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yes, yes. Like.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Okay.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Okay. What?

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Here it is. I don't understand what's happening. I don't really get it. Okay?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Now that it's turned on, it should start showing to, I did send you a video on hiver, AI. It's a pop up that comes on the right. And then, yeah… I mean, you can go back to the AI tools. This is turned on. So you would be good here. Yeah. And then tagging, are you using tagging currently?

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Not really. No, no.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  You don't think that's going to be helpful?

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  I mean… do.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  you use tags? Like in general?

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Not really. No, because I mean, we don't get flooded with emails. So it's you know, it's not like… no, I still don't even.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  OK. Are there any things that like, okay, so tags are like on the surface level, they are for categorization, but how I have seen a lot of customers use it, it's very amazing to see that there is diverse usage of tags across different customers. Like a few of the examples I'm going to like share and why am I sharing that? Because there's a lot of things on automation fronts that you can do with respect to tagging. Now, you had a customer service shared mailbox, now on slas, if you want to like, if you want to basically have slas on a certain group of emails that's coming in, say, for example, billing related query, like on a surface level, if you get a lot of billing related queries and you see that, hey, there is a lot of customers, there are a lot of customers writing about it and they're just not happy with the service and things like that. So maybe I can set up an SLA that's only applied on the tags that says billing as the tag name. And then like the response time can be four hours or three hours. Like I can reduce it. I can basically you analyzing the data on a monthly basis. Like on the analytics front and knowing, okay, these are the bottlenecks. This is something I want to track. And then you can use tags there to sort of track that. And also you can get notifications on a lot of things with respect to tags. Say, for example, I, I'm a lot interested in like say same billing related queries if I set up a billing tag and the AI is enabled on it. I basically have to do nothing. Anytime a query comes in, the AI is going to read the email like know that, okay, this is a billing related query because you would have already tagged 10 emails. And from that pattern, the AI would have learned that, hey, you know, this person is tagging billing on these emails where the content speaks like this. And then, and it automatically applies the tag billing. And then with respect to that, you can basically set up automations where maybe you are getting notified or maybe SLA is getting triggered and basically not only billing like VIP customers or somewhere where you want to sort of do certain things with a group of email or a topic. Yeah, in those lines. And I have seen a lot of customers like this is not in respect to like your use case, but people are also using AI with respect to different language of queries they receive. Like one of my european customers was like, I receive a lot of French queries and then German. So then they set up different tags. And now the French is going to the two three members that are like using like that deal with that language. So, maybe from your team, I'm not sure today how the customer service team is getting emails. But if there is an option where you would want this particular topic, say VIP customers to be only assigned to two senior most members, you can basically set up a tag saying VIP customer. And basically, when it gets tagged, you can assign it among those three members like your senior most members. And yeah, like that's pretty much how AI tagging can be used. You think if that makes sense, we can explore it. Otherwise, we can like let like we can just leave it for now.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  I mean, because not really again, we're not getting a ton of emails, you know, the customer service if you will, is going to the specific customer service. So the right people are already seeing it.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  I.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  mean, yeah, maybe I could add a few but it's not like a, oh, my God. I definitely need this type of situation. So, you… know, I have other automations kind of outside hiver, where like, you know, invoices or billing goes to those specific email addresses, and then there's automation that upload that stuff to my ERP system already. I don't see tagging for that. So, yeah, I mean, this… would be one of these things where I kind of keep in the background and maybe it's like, oh, aha, maybe I'll add a tag for that, but, okay.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, makes sense. No, I appreciate you letting me know that. I mean, that's completely fine. What my idea was just for you to know that, what capability it has in the future if something pops up and you think this can make sense? Definitely? But yeah, I mean, this is all about AI tagging. I have like, do you have sentiment analysis turned on for your, yeah.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  I do, I don't care for it.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Huh.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  I.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  okay. When you say like you don't care for it, like wouldn't you track the very negative conversations because a lot.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  I don't see negative like I'll see like, huh, of course, there's no more emails. Everyone's gone through them.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  That's a great thing.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Yeah. Like seeing like this. It's like, I don't really care like this is just a normal whatever, you know, email. These are just spam emails.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Huh.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  And I see all these, you know, sentiments. I don't you know, I don't care for it.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I don't need.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  To see the, I think it actually kind of thinking about out loud here, you know, if I have an employee who sees maybe a frown face and maybe they don't want to open it, you know? So it could actually, you know, hinder things?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, I.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  I just don't care for it, so.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  I think he froze or was it I, you're.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  back.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  okay. I was the one who froze. Huh. Okay. You were just like this on my screen. That was, okay. My internet must be acting up. Yeah, I was basically, yeah, I totally get your point when you say that the, angry emoji comes up for me. It's very funny. I'm like, what it is? Now, what are you angry about it's? Just so funny to open the emails. I can't like I'm in a customer success role and I can't be like not opening the angry emails. I would be the first one to be like, okay, what's making you so much angry? Like, yeah, that's funny. But, yeah, how many, like a lot of my customers have been using sentiment analysis like for escalations. Now, if you get a lot of like say escalations, where like we are not happy with the service or X y Z, you can basically set up an automation in the background that says, hey, when the AI sentiment is updated and the sentiment is very negative, send me a notification. So then you would be notified when someone is really angry or has written a very angry email apart from like anyone who picks up that email and walks on it, you always will have an eye on these emails. Now, one of our customers recently, like gave their testimony with respect to they saved some like some dollars with respect to just having that set up because one of their customers was like churning. And then the person that was managing that was out of office as well. So that notice came in. And since that was predicted under like very angry or like very negative in like sentiment terms. She basically got a notification. And then so she responded back to the customer and then they could save that churn.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  So, yeah, I mean, if that's something which is like important or like is making sense, then you can use sentiments like that. Okay, that's it on the AI front on the renewals front. Yes, your renewal is something I also wanted to discuss today as I can see, yeah, you're about to renew on December which is next month? Like, literally, yeah, we are 30 days ahead discussing this. So, I'm just curious how do you want to proceed? Like you want to proceed with one year contract or like two year contract? Because in two year contract, I could bundle like the AI and then make the pricing.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Well, I definitely want to look at extended contracts to help save money absolutely… with the AI. I do want to see kind of how much additional cost this is going to be because I certainly spend a lot of money on this software as it is. And I don't want it to even to balloon more than it needs to be for what I need. So I want to stick with you guys, but I just need to be careful spending.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, yeah, no, completely makes sense. I can give you both the options, I can pass on like an option with AI trial AI, add on and then one like the normal contract that we have and I'm going to make it two or three years. So three years is the maximum saving and two years is decent enough saving. I mean, we have certain discounts that we can give on a two year contract and then like more discounts on a three year contract. So you can let me know which ones like which.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Yeah. I mean, I'm good with a, you know, with a three year if I can, if I can, you know, I'm willing to lock in with you guys for three years if it's you know, actually worth my while too. So.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Okay. And another thing here when you say three year contract, like right now, you have 11 users. So are you looking to add more users in the coming years?

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Yes. So that's another thing too because, you know, I have users, I don't really need to use this and some come and some go. So that's kind of another thing too which is kind of like how, you know… trying to follow the, you know, the payments and all that too is kind of a little confusing. And also, I guess, you know, if, you know, and moreover to that point, you, know I pay up front. You know, I don't know if you guys offer, if I do a three year contract, do you split that? I don't want to pay three years up front. Let's just put it that way?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah, you can pay annually.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  So, yeah, I'd be like monthly thing or whatever it is. So I'm open to, you know, those types of conversations?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. I mean, we can make contract for three years, but then the billing frequencies can be different like it can be monthly, it can be quarterly, it can be annual. I have to check for three years. I think ideally they should be preferring annual. If annual works for you. I mean that should be good. But yeah, when I asked you if you're going to add more users, my whole point of that was we have something like bucket model pricing which is currently you are in 11. So if you want me to give you one, like, if you were planning to add like say maybe four more users by next year or like by next, like next two years or three years, you are planning to add close to 20 users, then I can give you the code with respect to that and this pricing that you're getting today will be logged in. So going forward, if you're paying like no matter if you're having 20 users or you're having 16 users, that's the price you're paying. So you can add more users, you can eliminate more users without worrying the fact like without worrying about the pricing. Yeah, that.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Would be, yeah, that'd be a little bit more helpful because, yeah, because right now it's just kind of like, oh, my goodness. Like, I know I paid for 11 upfront, but now it's like I'm not using 11 or whatever the case may be. OK?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  So, you think what's the count you're looking at? Because I'm going to frame your discounts and get approvals with respect to that, like you think 20 or 15? No?

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  15?

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  OK. So 11 to 15 is one bucket and then 16 to 20 is the next. So the only catch with this model pricing is when you are going to move, you'll have to move another bucket rather than adding one more user. Yeah, if you are an 11 to 15 bucket, obviously, we can obviously work out the pricing and discounts and we'll try to keep it same with like the next addition considering the fact that you will go for a three year contract. But that's the only catch. And I want to like, I wanted you to know that no.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Thank you. I think right now 11 to 15, is good.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  OK. Makes sense. Then, I can get these pricing sent over to you. I'll just share like one with AI, one without AI, and both would be bucket model so you can make your decision easier. And then I think the AI trial is limited for like November 15. So post November 15, that would be disabled for the accounts that would not have like paid AI add on. So by then once we have decided, we can basically move your account to that particular plan level.

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  Yeah. I.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Think that's it from my side. We are almost on time.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  So if there is anything else, let me know. I'm going to send us like the query to support post this call with respect to the AI suggestions and that's it from my side. Do you want to discuss anything else?

Ryan Phillips (ryan.phillips@thewholisticpet.com):
  I'm good. Right now. I actually have another meeting I need to get to but yeah, if things come up, I'll just shoot out an email to you but I'm OK, for now.

Sonali Sahoo (sonali.s@grexit.com):
  Yeah. Also we are connected on slack as well because I saw like udita had passed me the slack channel. Yeah. Feel free to ask if there are any quick questions. You can just pass it on slack and I respond. Yeah, perfect. All right. Then. Thank you for your time. Have a good day. Bye.
