Date: 2025-11-10T17:58:04+05:30
================================================================================

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  you have come. Yes, I am good to go. Yes, I am.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Not using any AI features. So… these guys have extension till the end of this month as default product manager.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I didn't get anything. I was asked to check you for a backup. Yes, I.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  saw it on the dashboard too. I checked the chat mailboxes and there was nothing.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Do you want to take the lead on demoing aif, talking about it or do you want me to qualify on the show? You?

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Can qualify? No problem. I will take the lead on demoing if you want to qualify, you can do it. Okay?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Done. Okay. Bye.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Hi, hi, Raghav.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hey, Rana. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you now. How's it going?

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  It's fine. All good.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sweet. All right, Rana. I think we'll take a minute. It's the first time I think you're speaking with us. So wanted to take a quick minute to introduce ourselves. I'm Raghav, I work as the account manager for air iq. I've been with the hiver business for like eight years now, been working with pius and Sashi so far on all the hiver related stuff. Yeah, it's a pleasure meeting you man. I'm gonna pass it to mugunth real quick to introduce himself and we can kick it off.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Hey, hi, this is mugunth here. I'm the success manager for air iq's account earlier. I've been working with krishna pius and, you know, Sashi from your team to get the new features and we even recently moved them from a monthly to an annual contract and so on. So, lots of going with them. It's good to see a new face here. Would love to work closely with you. The only difference between my role and Raghav's role is that I'm more like a technical point of contact wherein I act as a consultant to prescribe some of the best practices which will help you get the maximum amount of hiver. So, yeah, that's it about myself. Pleasure meeting you, Raghav.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  You too. Bye. So, yeah, we can start with the product description. So actually, I got a mail from your end that there is a, you know, AI feature available in your software, right? In your hiver product. So I want to know more about that. What are the features you know, and how it works?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Yeah, definitely. Raghav. And before we continue, are you expecting anybody by the name of Richard to join us on the meeting, correct? Correct?

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Got it. All right. I've got a new name on the meeting that wasn't there direct.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  It's from the operation. Actually, they'll be using the product actually.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, that makes sense. So then while we, now that Richard's here, Richard, hi, can you hear us?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Hello?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, Raghav, I think Richard's just sorting out some audio issues. So, Raghav, while we wait for Richard, if you don't mind, could you do a quick introduction of what you do and what your role at riq? So.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  I hit the product.

Richard:
  Hi, good evening. Can you hear me guys?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, Richard, we can hear you loud and clear.

Richard:
  Okay. Hi. Good evening.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, Raghav. Sorry, go ahead.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Yeah. So I hit the product department. So I look up the products, you know, the requirement product department of the company?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, got. it. Got it. All right. Pleasure meeting. You, have you interacted or used hiver?

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Yeah. I've used hiver before.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Makes sense. Richard. Hi, we're just wrapping up introductions. So, if you don't mind, could you take a couple of minutes to just introduce us to your role and your responsibilities at riq?

Richard:
  Okay. Hi. My name is Richard. So basically, I am taking over operations.

Richard:
  I handle operations and we have been using hiver past couple of years. I guess we know the basic analytics and all regarding viber and all hiver. Sorry?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. No worries. All right. Well, it looks like both of you have been on hiver as well for a bit and have had direct interaction with the system. So that means I'm you know, basically going to kind of like jump into the AI features and the AI side of things, you know, to kick it off just so that I can get some bearings in terms of what features to showcase any usage of AI at riq as a business right now. Like what does that look like? What kind of tools do you all use on a daily basis?

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Hello? Just a second.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, sure. For sure.

Richard:
  Can I go ahead and explain? Yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Sure. Definitely one of you. Any one of you? Okay?

Richard:
  So basically what we are doing at the moment is currently all are emailed. Okay? So our customers are there who writes an email to us. So our main email address is in Gmail itself. Okay? So our client emails us, then we read their emails and whatever is their query, we try to know resolve the query and all. So in terms of automation and all AI and all, so we might be needing some, you know, like dispatches automations and all, because we have a various department over here, right? So there are some emails which needs to be sent to one group, one different department automatically. So in those cases, we might need some automations plus AI, but there are, we might receive some emails regarding cancellations for that. We have a different cancellation reference team. We have a team for rescheduling and all. So basically, we deal with airline. Okay? We deal with airline. So we'll we normally receive emails regarding flight cancellations, reschedule and all, you know, other emails, basic emails and all, so accordingly, we have a different groups. So likewise. So as soon as someone emails, so currently also like we have hiver, so basically what we are doing currently is we have to know there has to be some dedicated person who has to assign those mails. But I think like if there are some ais and like, you know, automations that can easily transfer that particular email to the group, the person who is on that group. And also, if you have any automations and all, then you know, like as soon as one agent or anyone is closing that mail as soon as they are closing the mail, like if there is a feature where you can open the new email which is pending on that particular group.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So essentially, you're looking at.

Richard:
  AI and also like, you know, like if you have some, you know, AI to track our SLA breaches and all, and the current reports, how many emails are pending? And all, you know, which is refreshed, which is being refreshed in a fraction of seconds, like 15 seconds or 10 seconds, all those things.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. So you're effectively looking at AI that reduces the operational manual work at this point. And you're also looking for like AI led or AI driven reporting that makes things a little more faster and a whole lot clearer to understand as opposed to multiple reports. Is that a good summary?

Richard:
  Yes.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. And when it comes to just one more question before I jump into the demo, right? When it comes to the replies that actually go out both to internal teams and to your clients at the end of the day, is there any kind of a writing assistance or gemini or anything like that you use or would like to use?

Richard:
  We don't use it, but if you have that feature already with you guys, you know, like that will be, very, helpful for us because while writing any emails, there might be some mistakes and all, there might be some grammatical errors and all, if gemini or like if the AI can, you know, like change some words and, you know, make it more like easy for our clients and all to understand that will be great. I guess.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Makes sense. Absolutely.

Richard:
  And also like I think if you have like, then we can also do that. No like these days Google is having that summarize emails. If there are like, you know, bundle of emails on one particular trail mail. So if you can just summarize it, and if you can just read what is the main thing about that?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah, makes sense. And thanks for that, Richard Rana. Anything else to add?

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Yeah, Raghav. Sorry, actually I was out.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No worries.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  So, one thing, yes. So we ought to, can you show your products, you know, how it works, you know, and we can pick up what we can utilize from it.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah, definitely. Like obviously, I'm going to be showing you the product. The reason I ask these questions is because it helped me show it in a way that will resonate, right? Being a product owner. I'm sure you understand that. So that's what I was coming from. So with that said, can you see my screen? Yes. Yeah. All right, Richard. I take it you can also see my screen and I'm going to continue from here. All right. So, folks, when it comes to AI route on hiver, we're effectively looking at it from two broader categories or approaches in itself, right? The first route and the first approach we're taking, I'm sorry, my sandbox is going haywire today. Your accounts are going to be fine, but effectively from the AI, we're taking it in two categories, one called the AI agent route, and one called the AI co pilot route. Now, the agent route is what Richard was effectively looking for, right? Which is where hiver's AI takes the lead when it comes to operational efficiency, automatically categorizing emails, automatically, giving you a sentiment of sorts. You can start getting a read of things, a thank you detector that automatically closes emails. If there's anything but a thank you on an email that's when it gets left open, right? So from a broad stroke perspective, these are the three features that we have that's already out in about before the end of this week. We're also going to be launching something called an AI quality assistant, right? And that's going to give Richard Rana all of your team leads on hiver, more visibility and control into how you can use hiver to track the things you mentioned, right? Grammatical errors, phrasing, errors, conversations, what that looks like in the whole scene there. So that's the agent route we're taking. We're also going to be having AI suggested responses and AI tasks both slated for December or before December. Basically. So over the next one and a half months, you're going to have three more features launched on an AI front, AI agent specific perspective. So that's one half of the AI route. The second half of it is the co pilot and this is more of your writing assistant, right? The parts of hiver that would help the actual agents on the ground address emails, better write faster replies. And this is where we take more of a detailed approach when it comes to these answers that AI suggests. So at the top of the summary that's pretty much how things pan out. Now, let me start going into detail. One after the other. AI tagging for starters is a way where you train the hiver AI model on how you'd want a certain email to be categorized or tagged to say it in our terms. Now, these could be tags where you need specific information, you want to track it based on how your team works. But it's not always a direct response. So look at AI tagging for scenarios and cases where you need probabilistic prediction on that front. So what I mean by that is for example, if I'm going to be having, I want to track a tag called feedback or refund. For example, in a typical scenario where you're building out a workflow, you'd only pump it in with keywords that resonate with refund. Right? You'd say if the customer writes refund, if they say chargeback, if they say where's my money, then add the tag as refund that's your normal workflow based automation builder on hiver that you've had so far, well, we all know that's not going to be completely sufficient. It's not going to cover the entire scenario. So that's where AI takes the lead. And if you give refund as a tag and you train the AI, what I mean by train is basically have 10 emails, manually added the tag of refund. So you or anybody in the team just manually needs to add a tag 10 times on an email from the AI takes over. Firstly, it gives you a summary or like a snapshot telling you these are the cases that I feel should fall under the refund tag. Is that right? Is that accurate? That way you have full control on the learning model in itself and you can train it better based on how you'd like for it to be accurately predictive there, right? And so, once it's got 10 emails, what's going to happen is hiver is going to first move it to a different space called manage where you'll be able to get an entire prompt that's hiver AI generated that tells you this is the scope of emails for which I'll add the refund tag. If you feel you want to widen the scope, you want to reduce it, feel free to play with the prompt and you should be good to have that more refined and more direct once it's done. Once it's ready, enable it from that point forward. Hiver's AI is going to automatically add that tag to all matching conversations irrespective… so that's the AI tagging piece in itself as a whole. Now, what it can do is be the first step for more powerful automation using the workflow. Builder where you no longer have to say if these criteria are met, add the tag. Instead, you can focus on what needs to happen in the team. Once an email is tagged or categorized to your example, Richard, excuse me, to your original example email comes in, you check the details, and you realize, hey this needs to be marked as internal flight ops, for example, then the AI can be trained to add the tag. You can set up a workflow that says if it's tagged as flight ops, urgent, an alert needs to go to the team lead. An email needs to go out to team X, right? Different team internally, and it needs to be reassigned to a different person at the team. So that's some of the examples you can create using AI tagging at the front, pause for questions. Any questions? Does that make sense?

Richard:
  No questions.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  All right. Cool. So continue, yeah, Rana. Oh, okay. Cool. So the next part of AI that we have on the agent route is the AI sentiment analysis. And this one's as straightforward as it gets, right? Yep.

Richard:
  Raghav, I just want to interrupt over here. I just want to ask you like see this, whatever training we're giving to AI, right? You know, like that will be, you know, everything that has to be done manually or, you know, like once the system is receiving 10 20 emails, it will auto read or, you know, like auto learn.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, great question. So all that you need to do to train the hiver AI model is 10 emails. For the first time after that, the system will basically pick up from there, expand its learning and you can effectively go at it from there. So, the only training you need to do is 10 emails. For the first time you're enabling a tag to be driven by AI. After that, it takes over… yep. All right. And in terms of refinement, once it's learned. And once it's active, that's where prompt engineering comes in and you can go in and be like, all right, change this, add this. These are emails that need to be better. So you always have the access to train it whenever you want to. But you don't need to do it after the first 10 times. Hope that makes sense. Yeah. All right. Cool. So, yeah, so that's the tagging piece coming to the sentiment that's basically a quick way where hiver is now able to give you from a chosen three or five point scale, a quick little emoji on the email saying, hey, this is what the tonality and the sentiment of the customer is. Now, if you've got five, if you want it to be pretty detailed, you can keep it at three. If you want it to be straightforward. Again, this becomes more of a stage two stage three based workflow builder. You can be like, hey, if somebody's coming in with a negative sentiment trigger a note to the customer automatically saying, hey, we're sorry, you're not having a great experience. Write back to us here's the details or if it's a very important high value market customer, you can even be like, hey, for these companies, if there's a negative sentiment, immediately escalate it to the manager and have a custom email going out from the manager just for these high value customers. So you have a lot of room to automate and make that process better as well. And when it comes to what would hiver classify positive negative neutral again, a little bit of prompt engineering is effectively what we offer to you in terms of that fine tuning that you'll need. So it comes with a default prompt. This is what hiver will classify as a very positive sentiment in our case. And if you want that to function a little differently, you can have those added in. And Richard, just like the AI tagging as well, sentiment analysis would be able to get better based on how you train it initially and on an ongoing basis with the prompt in itself. So you're always going to have a feedback loop when it comes to the AI. Functionality within hiver as a whole. Okay, and then the next piece which is where the whole knowledge base, the whole source related response builder comes in where AI is able to write answers for your team, give you that priority on the data and correct the text that's written that's where ask AI takes the lead. Now, when you're setting it up, obviously, you begin by, in terms of training, you can either upload any kind of process documents that you want. So if it's like different airlines, there's different processes, different terms of service, things like that. Those could be information you upload to the knowledge base on AI. You could also upload internal processes, internal ways of handling things as well to the knowledge base. And what AI can do at the end of the day is once all of this bit of information is ready, the model is trained, this is how things will start working for you. So to start at the top and giving you a few examples as we go, firstly, when it comes to the AI tagging, that's going to be these tags that you see on my screen billing feature request refund. These are all tags that can be automatically added by AI when these emojis are your sentiment analysis. And as you can see, you can view it right from here, you can filter for it as well. So you have a more detailed list where you're like, okay, anything negative. I want to see it in a separate space that's where these views come in. And then the ask AI piece that I showed you last, which is trained based on the knowledge sources and everything that becomes a neat little button here which would help you do one of two things summarizing that you mentioned Eric, I'm, sorry, Richard, you go open any email no matter how small or large it is and you ask AI to summarize it, it's not just going to stop with, hey, this is a brief, what the email is about. It's actually going to be able to tell you here's. A summary of the data here's. The specific issues that you've received on that email. If it's a long chain with multiple back and forths, AI is also going to be able to tell you these are the actions that were taken. This is the current status. And as per your process document, this seems to be the next step that you should be doing here. All of this becomes intel that an agent can quickly track and handle using ask AI with the right source of information. Now, as an extension of this, once this is done, you're like, hey, now, I want you to draft a reply, you say draft a reply asking for more details, for instance, just pump that in there. And AI is now going to be able to give me an entire drafted response using my knowledge source, using my process document included on it to give me that one email that I can send in one click. You please confirm a few details, so we can investigate who initiated the issue. Do you recognize these email addresses? Is there a confirmation, can you provide screenshots? So this then becomes a one click insert which can be sent out as a reply. And in terms of feedback loop, right? If you feel it's right? It's not doing a great job that's a quick little feedback from there. And you can basically clear the chat if you want to ask it a new set of questions based on process document number two, if that helps. So it becomes a little more conversational and its knowledge source is purely trained on the documents that you upload. Meaning it's only going to have a very narrow contextual learning model there in terms of the data it has and the information it gives you. So I'm going to pause here and see if the ask AI piece makes sense or if there's any other examples you'd like for me to run you through on that front?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So if you look at the reason I opened, this is different emails talking about user training and everything. And we've sent an auto reply. So if I do summarize here just to show you like a quick comparison, this summarizer will now be able to tell me, hey, the user training. Was this? The customer said links are received, action taken, says CS team sent training links, support auto reply, acknowledge the receipt. It even identifies that this is an auto reply and it tells you status is invites are sent awaiting further updates during business hours. Next step is customer to join if rescheduling is needed or confirm on that support to respond with any additional assistance. Now, if I have more of my support team's sows here like statement of work and process here, it's going to be able to give me next steps very attuned based on that.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  And then the last piece is a very specific aspect of AI that's very granular in terms of how it's used. And this mostly ties back to the type of emails you receive. So if you do receive and I'm guessing you do a lot of emails that include numericals, like alphanumerics, right? Order id, in your case, that could be flight numbers, tracking numbers, statuses. I know you work with a lot of GPS coordinates as a business, so that's all going to be information you receive flight manifest, for instance, could be one, all of those could be extracted using AI, and that could be pumped into a certain field. Again, what you can do is be like, hey, I want to use AI extract, scan the body and the subject of the email. And I want you to track flight numbers. For instance, the training model again very specific here needs only three examples. Pull that in shows you emails you confirm, and then what it can do is extract the flight number, for example, feed it into a custom field. Now, why do you need an automation like this pretty straightforward? Let's say you're tracking a ton of emails on a daily basis within flight ops. And the only first, like one of the important things an agent needs to know is that alphanumeric code in a regular world that's usually an order id, invoice number, things like that. So what you can do is have this automatically fetched pumped into a field on the right side that's text based or you can even have like a quick summary built out there, right?

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Raghav, I'll interrupt you a bit. Yes, please. Yeah. Can you tell me like, you know, can it recognize the, suppose, you know, somebody sends a mail, there's a ticket attached with it, right? So, can it detect the travel date and make it, you know, in priority… there might be a mail, you know, cancellation mail. The travel date is today only right? So can it detect that thing?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  That's a very good question. So far we've tested it on alphanumeric codes and just numericals as well. And it's worked pretty great at this point. What I'd say is as an AI model, I'm sure it can go that route, but I'd like for you to test it with a few examples, give us some feedback, so we can take a look at whether it's able to do that continuously or how we can tweak it as well. So that it does that.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Thank you. Yeah.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. So, yeah, folks, tldr that's some of the hiver AI features that we feel would be useful in terms of what's on the roadmap for right now, we're going to be having that AI quality analysis that I mentioned launching by Friday this week. We're also working on AI insights which is AI based reporting to automatically surface trends and everything. A small preview to that is the AI sentiment report, right? This is where you can go in, track your sentiment data by day, range, date, range, track it by agent. You've got that whole visibility here where you can clearly see per agent what's their handling like and have they converted a customer journey? The sentiment is ongoing. Somebody comes in as negative. Raghav by handling the case, well, moves them to a positive emotion. When they leave you're going to be able to track that over reporting as well. So, these are some of the things that are on our roadmap. And I'm happy to share additional collateral if you'd like to see that as well in terms of what it would look like.

Richard:
  Okay, Raghav, I just want to check if there are any agents available. Okay? So I just want to check how many emails was replied by that particular agent today yesterday?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, yeah. That's pretty straightforward. What I'd recommend is maybe consider some dashboards.

Richard:
  Also, or also like, you know, for example, if we have four or five groups over here, okay. So I just want to check how many emails are pending on that particular groups?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I'm sorry for interrupting. Please complete. And.

Richard:
  Also just like if there are 14 emails or 15 emails in one particular group and out of 15 emails, how many emails SLA has already been?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Breached?

Richard:
  And if SLA has been breached, do we have option to escalate that particular email directly to the team leader? Yes, not escalate, but at least send a notification to the team leader.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely. So everything that you're asking for is completely possible. What I'd suggest is I'll show you a quick brief overview on how that can be done. And I'd recommend booking some time with mugunth, dedicated for this, he should be able to give you like a full rundown help you set it up and work with you ongoing as well. But to give you a summary, right? Richard to your question, firstly, you want to track active conversations grouped by assignee. So this tells you new conversations grouped by the owner. You're able to see resolved conversations by the assignee as well. So for example, if you want to see how many emails did Raghav resolve active upon and close it today, that's a quick little snippet there on how that dashboard would look like. You want to get more detailed reporting. One click. It builds out the entire data, row by row, email by email timestamp individually. So reporting to that extent can definitely be built out. The second one you'd mentioned was about wanting to look at slas and what that looks like. So for example, I can do is basically again a lot of this is just building out the right dashboard in the report. But again to show you, hey, I want to see it for today, for example, do that date range for yesterday. In my case, just to make sure that I have some data I'm going to expand that. This is effectively what you do choose the timeframe and you get to see at an SLA level, how many were first response violations? How many were resolution violations? Analyze? And that's going to give you that entire granularity you want support policy? You can name the policies, right? So it will tell you the name of the policy. What was the time when it was violated? When was it actually resolved? Was it actually done? And you can group it by the owner as well. This policy?

Richard:
  Is the rule that we set?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Exactly. Yes. This is the rule you set up on hiver, this one under admin panel, right? So, any rule you have here, my first suggestion would be have a name attached to it. So it's pretty straightforward. And when you run reporting, it's very clear on which SLA was breached. What that was for the second part of your question was, can you automate something? Definitely? You can be like, hey, just to show you an example. Again, you can be like, hey, I want to track it based on SLA violation, first response resolution, either or both. If you're clear about first reply, you can set one for that. If it's a mix and you want to track for both, do that second one, you select the policy again, that rule that you have. Then you're like, all right, if SLA policy is violated and, you know, it's based on time, it's based on subject any and all of these, you could effectively have that float to a certain person. Could be notifying the manager on a hiver alert on the bell here, it could be sending an email to the manager. It could even be replying to the customer saying, hey, we're very sorry that we're delayed on this. The best of our team is working on it. We'll help you with an expedited reply at the earliest. You can do it all the way to that extent. Yeah. So just to show you like a full example built out, I'll be like, hey, if it's from this customer, right? Let me just say contains and I'm going to put hiverhq. Com, I'm going to put it to, for instance, do that. And I'll be like, if the, from email contains this domain, then I want hiver to do an action. And that action is send notification that's your bell alert there, send an email along with the notification. They get the manager gets an email in their inbox saying this email subject here's the link to open it. This is the owner of that email in your team. And this one's breached the SLA, right? And you can like pretty much keep building on top of it from there, assign it to a manager, reassign it. Have a different tag added for priority. And even like I said, you know, send a reply to the customer specifically case by case, custom written templates that go out. So that's the extent to which you can build out automations. And like I said, mugunth is going to be your go to person when it comes to building out the entirety of it. So, from an AI perspective. Richard and Rana. Those were some of the things I had in mind for today's. Call. So as next steps from my side, what I'll do is between me and mugunth, we'll bundle an email together, give you the full PDF that we have on the entire vision, shows you which features we're working on, give you a quick update on the features that are planned for qford this month and next month. So, you know, exactly what's coming. And based on that, if you'd like we can have your team get more trained and you can have start trialing it basically as it says, we do have trial access right now, so you would be able to start testing it. And we can keep that conversation going for now. I'm going to pass it back to mugunth so that you can get a detailed discussion lined up for automations, slas, reporting as well and you can take it from there on that.

Richard:
  I just wanted to ask you one thing Raghav, we don't have anything in hiver, like where, you know, like we can try or test it for a week or a 15 days from, because, you know, like see what happens usually is like most of the things will get clear when we go through it and we work, we create some rules from our end and, you know, and we can see the whole scenarios because at the moment, whatever we can see is just a summary of it like in a very, you know, like… in a very fast forward time, I think so. But, you know, like if we go ahead, like if I have time, I can go through it, I can create my own entire group and all I think things will be more clear?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  So I'm sorry, I don't think I understood the ask there, are you trying to look for like a sandbox environment or something like that?

Richard:
  Like exactly.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. I mean, we don't technically have like a sandbox environment in that sense of it. But if you'd like we can have like a dummy mailbox created for you. If you have any spare domains or spare email addresses that you don't use as a business and something that you have internally, mugunth can work with you to create a sandbox mailbox for you, which you can primarily just use for testing purposes, have only the people that you want added that's straightforward.

Richard:
  So when I can, you know, add one, two agents of mine, I can create some rules and all I can play around with that definitely. And I think I will be more clear with what I want and what I don't want and what changes I require on those things.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that's completely doable. Definitely. Yeah, mugunth, will be a go to Guy on that. Definitely. So that's why I recommend it. We get some time on the calendar for later this week, early next week depending on your availability, Richard, right? And he can help you with the sandbox environment creation or mailbox creation. He can show you the specific features, what's best practices there based on which you can test it for maybe two weeks. We can meet again in two weeks and we can discuss ideas there. Okay. Yes. All right.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  So, one thing Raghav, I have a question. Suppose, you know, suppose, if I give a backend id password, suppose I give it to you. So will you be able to recognize all the PNRS or flight data? Oh, no, just two PNRS?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  I don't think we'll be able to, I'll tell you, yes, please. What?

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Is our idea? I'll tell you see, suppose, you know, if it's a LCC and GDS department out there, right? And there is a refund department out there, right? So suppose, if I give you our backend id and password, so, can you map it in a system in our hiver system where, you know, you'll be able to pull the PNR details, the passenger details and all. So it will be easy for our department, you know, to get escalated.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, that makes sense. And is there API connection capabilities to this backend system of?

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Yours? Yes, we.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  can, okay. That's a good point. And I think we might be able to achieve something using webhooks and API.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Richard, I think it was very helpful, right?

Richard:
  Yes… that will help us in various ways. I think for example, if we can read all the data from our backend system, it will be easy for us to, you know, like where to that email should go in which department or which group also like if the travel need, if you can read from there, we can escalate that we can make it priority. Yes, we can put.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  A priority on that. It exists, definitely. Suppose if there is a disease here, so it only works within 24 hours, right? So in that case, we can escalate that to a priority department. Who can, you know, do it on time?

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  No, definitely. I'm sure a lot of this is definitely going to be possible using apis and webhooks on the hiver side as well. It's just that it's too early and I want to completely scope it out before I can tell you the extent to which we can have it established for you. So, yeah. So on that front, Rana and Richard, if you have any of this information on a document or something or your process on a document, if you can send that over to me and mugunth, after the call, that would help us discuss this internally with our engineering team, we can bring our team as well to the next call. So we scope out what's needed, the level of work needed, and we can probably start planning on to what that would look like.

Richard:
  Okay. Thank you.

Raghav Shankar (raghav@hiverhq.com):
  For sure. All right, folks. On that note, I am going to hand it over to mugunth real quick so he can schedule time for later this week. I do have to drop off for my next meeting. So I'll see you all soon then. Thank you so much. Okay?

Richard:
  Thank you, Raghav really appreciate it. Thank you. It's a drama.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Before we leave. So what I'm suggesting is right now based on what we discussed so far, I see that you're manually assigning the emails, you haven't set up an slas, or whenever an SLA breach has happened, there is no escalation procedure or mechanism in place. What we could do is we could pick a couple of shared mailbox and try automating the assignment procedure. The automation could be done either based on the email subject content or based on the sender who's receiving it. If it's more like a VIP customers, we could directly assign it to the VIP or the priority teams who handles it. There are a lot of more things which we could do with the automations front. And we can also slowly touch base now that while discussing those automation. I also get a gist of how your team is currently using it. And I can also parallelly prescribe the AI tagging, the sentiment analysis functionality, and so on. When could we do this workflow review session? Richard, Rana… I'm based out of India. I'm in the city called Chennai. So the timing won't be a challenge to work out among us.

Rana (rana@airiq.in):
  Fine, Richard, when is it possible to do it?

Richard:
  Mugunth, what we'll do is we'll discuss this with our boss also.

Richard:
  Okay. And when we'll discuss together also what we can do and what other changes also require, then we'll let you know on that as soon as possible.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Got it. Sure. So, can I tentatively block some time in our calendar for late this week like Thursday or Friday?

Richard:
  That can be fine. That can be done. Okay? Thursday, you can block for around like, you know, after four o'clock around like same time?

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Four P. M. I'll just block it for four to five P. M. What we could do is I'll also do some quick review of your account in terms of what are all the other features enhancements which we could do among your existing plan and capabilities, how it could improve?

Richard:
  But as far as I know mugunth in our plan, this analytics features, everything was there. I'm not sure about the SLA policies but I know analytics.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Yes, yes. SLA policy is there, Richard, I mean, like you are in the pro plan, so you might be having all the features and functionalities. It's like the second from the top plan, which is the elite plan. So only limitations you have with the elite plan is the lesser number of chat mailboxes, even that we have unblocked for the riq team wherein you have an unlimited access to chat mailbox and a couple of other elite functionality. Apart from that, pretty much what elite has.

Richard:
  But mugunth, we can do that also, right? For example, this chat functions and all, we can only give it to a couple of agents, not giving it to everyone. And like this, you know, like some, you know, like autofills things like, you know, which I think will be only necessary for a supervisor or team lead.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Can you please come again, Richard? I mean, like.

Richard:
  I just wanted to ask you this, whatever this chat facilities are the AI things and all that. We can only give it to a few of the agents, not to everyone.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Got it. That is something I need to check internally because AI basically what it does is when it comes to for tagging, it makes sense because you as an administrator only need to have access but for using the AI co pilot functionality, which helps in summarizing the emails and, you know, kind of, you know, generating the emails. And Raghav forgot to mention about this new feature which is in beta. Do you have any email templates Richard, which your agents use?

Richard:
  We do have, but we have not implemented in our Gmail, got it. Got it.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Yeah. If you have some email templates based on the email templates, AI kind of, you know, reads the email and it feels that could be answered with the help of this particular email template, it kind of, you know, surfaces to your, agents could just click on the email template, hit send.

Richard:
  So actually we have already worked with this, you know, dispatcher, this trigger things and all this automations and all. Okay?

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Okay.

Richard:
  So, we are aware about like how to do and all those things. Okay? So I think like we are fine with it. Just, I just wanted to know because the main scenarios, what we are looking at the moment is, you know, auto assigns and all. And one feature I asked you which I think like hit in it for me. I just wanted to ask you like, you know, if I'm working on one email as soon as I resolve that email? Okay? Like is it possible, you know, like that automatically? If there is any pending emails that will show up in my screen on that agency screen?

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  So, let's say that you have worked on an email and you have.

Richard:
  Closed it. Yes. As soon as I close, another pops up.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Another one pops up.

Richard:
  No, I just wanted to ask you, is there any feature like, you know, as soon as I close one email, another one opens? Because I want that feature. Okay?

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, okay. You just want to know the list of emails which are assigned to you right after you have closed it. Yeah, we could do that with the help of views and tags, everything we could do that. Yeah. So basically, what we could do is we could kind of, you know, create a custom views, which kind of, you know, gives you the list of tickets which are assigned to you in the open state?

Richard:
  See now, I can make it more clear. I guess. So if there are like, you know, if there are five tickets pending?

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. So.

Richard:
  If I am working in one ticket as soon as I close one ticket, I want to, you know, the new ticket to open in my screen as soon as I resolve one.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Oh, okay. That isn't something which is possible, but we could create views in such a way that agents are aware of the tickets which are assigned to them. And we can also create custom views to show them that these are all the tickets which are in open status and pending status. So whenever they close the ticket, what automatically happens is the ticket which is closed goes away from this open or pending status and it also goes from the assigned to them status to kind of, you know, closed status. That is something which is doable. It's more like the other way around.

Richard:
  Okay.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. I'll just when we connect on Thursday, I'll just give you a quick walkthrough of how to set up some quick views and filters which would benefit your team and so on. And then the main pain point automating the manual assignment that could be done in multiple ways. We'll just figure out the most better one which suits our iq's needs. And then we could set it up that shouldn't be an issue that's the main focus of the Thursday's session to kind of give you an overall walkthrough of hiver, getting to know your use case better so that I can also prescribe some other features to you. Okay. What I'll do is I'll tentatively block our calendars on Thursday from four PM to five PM ist. And then we can take it forward from there.

Richard:
  Okay.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Okay. Rana, any other question from Aaron? No, I'm okay. Yeah. So Richard Rana, I mean, like just to be even more clear as a customer success manager, it's my, you know, what do you call it responsibility? It's such a strong word, but it's my responsibility to make sure that you kind of use the product better. So please feel free to throw any questions at me. Think of me as my consultant to prescribe the best practices that's what my roles and responsibilities are within hiver. So I'll be there no problem.

Richard:
  So mugunth, you know, like as I said earlier, so we will provide you one Gmail address of ours or anything where you can, you know, create a like, you know, some, what Farhan was saying, you know, sand id, something like that. So I can, we can also go ahead and test it ourselves how it works and all that.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  Definitely, I could do a, because we have close to 20 20, I mean, like I'm pretty sure that our Ikea has more than 20 plus shared mailboxes. I can give you a quick walkthrough to set up the automations, and so on. Then you can also replicate the same settings for the other shared mailboxes and so on. We could go by that way as well Richard. Okay. Yeah, okay. Thank you so much for your time.

Richard:
  Thank you.

Mugunth (mugunthraj.bs@hiverhq.com):
  See you. Thank you. Bye bye.

Richard:
  Okay. Bye bye. Thank you.
