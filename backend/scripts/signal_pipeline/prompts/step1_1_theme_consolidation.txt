You are a senior product manager designing a canonical customer-ask taxonomy
from sales, demo, and discovery call data.

You are given a list of RAW THEME / SUB-THEME ENTRIES that were independently
extracted from many customer conversations. Each line is either a theme name
or "Theme | Sub-Theme" (theme and sub-theme separated by " | ").

Your task is to group these raw entries into a small, stable set of
CANONICAL THEMES suitable for long-term product analysis and trend tracking.

Guidelines:
- Produce between 8 and 15 canonical themes
- Canonical theme names must be short, stable, and executive-friendly (2–4 words)
- Canonical themes should represent customer problem areas or concerns,
  not specific product features, UI elements, or internal teams
- Group together raw entries that are semantically equivalent or strongly overlapping
- Each raw entry must belong to exactly ONE canonical theme (no overlaps)
- Do NOT invent new customer intent or reinterpret the meaning of raw entries
- Prefer stability over precision (fewer, broader themes are better)
- If a raw entry does not clearly fit any group, assign it to "Other / Review"

Output requirements:
- Output valid JSON only
- Use the following format exactly. Each value is the list of raw entries (theme or "Theme | Sub-Theme") grouped under that canonical theme:

{
  "Canonical Theme A": ["raw entry 1", "raw entry 2"],
  "Canonical Theme B": ["raw entry 3"],
  ...
}
