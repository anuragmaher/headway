# HeadwayHQ Phase 1 - Implementation Guide

---

## Project Overview

### What is HeadwayHQ?

HeadwayHQ is a **product intelligence platform** that helps product teams make better decisions by automatically aggregating and analyzing customer feedback from multiple sources. Instead of manually reading through hundreds of Slack messages and emails, HeadwayHQ uses AI to extract feature requests, organize them by themes, and provide competitive context.

### The Problem We're Solving

**Current State:**
- Product managers manually read through Slack channels (#customer-feedback, #support)
- Customer emails scattered across Gmail, support systems
- No centralized view of what customers are asking for
- Hard to prioritize: Which features are most requested? Which are urgent?
- No visibility into what competitors are building
- Feature requests get lost or forgotten

**Pain Points:**
- 2-3 hours per week reading Slack messages
- Difficult to spot patterns across multiple channels
- Can't quantify demand (how many people want dark mode?)
- Competitors ship features before you even know customers want them
- Sales loses deals due to missing features you didn't know about

### Our Solution

HeadwayHQ automates the entire feedback analysis pipeline:

1. **Aggregate**: Connect Slack and Gmail → automatically sync messages
2. **Extract**: AI reads messages and identifies feature requests
3. **Organize**: Features automatically grouped into themes (Design, Analytics, Security, etc.)
4. **Contextualize**: Shows which competitors already have each feature
5. **Prioritize**: Sort by mention count, urgency, competitive pressure

**Result:** Product teams save hours per week and make data-driven decisions about what to build next.

## Why We're Building This

### Personal Motivation

At Hiver, we receive customer feedback across multiple channels:
- Slack: #customer-feedback, #support, #sales
- Gmail: customer emails, support tickets
- Calls: Sales calls (Gong recordings)

**The current process is broken:**
- Product managers spend hours reading Slack threads
- Feature requests mentioned in passing get missed
- Hard to know: "How many customers want SSO?"
- By the time we decide to build something, competitors already shipped it

**We need this tool for ourselves first.**

### Market Opportunity

**Target Users:**
- B2B SaaS product managers
- Startup founders (wearing PM hat)
- Product teams at 10-500 person companies

**Market Size:**
- 50,000+ B2B SaaS companies globally
- Average 2-5 product managers per company
- Existing tools (Productboard, Canny) are expensive ($400-800/month)
- Most companies use spreadsheets or Notion (not scalable)

**Positioning:**
- More affordable than Productboard ($149/month vs $400+/month)
- Smarter than Canny (AI-powered analysis vs manual tagging)
- Competitive intelligence built-in (unique differentiator)

### Business Goals

**Phase 1 (This Build):**
- Validate the concept with Hiver team (5 internal users)
- Prove AI can extract features accurately (80%+ accuracy)
- Demonstrate time savings (2+ hours per week saved)

**Phase 2 (Next 3 Months):**
- Add Gmail integration
- Add competitive intelligence (scrape competitor changelogs)
- Launch to 10 external beta customers

**Phase 3 (6 Months):**
- Add revenue data (CRM integration)
- Public launch on Product Hunt
- Target: $3,000 MRR (15 paying customers at $200/month)

## Product Strategy

### Phase 1 Scope (What We're Building Now)

**Core Value Proposition:**
"Connect your Slack workspace and see all customer feature requests organized by themes in one dashboard."

**Key Features:**
- Slack OAuth integration (connect workspace)
- Message syncing (automatic, hourly)
- AI feature extraction (Claude API)
- Theme-based organization (Design, Analytics, Security, etc.)
- 3-column dashboard (Themes → Features → Details)
- Dark mode (because we work late nights)

**What We're NOT Building (Yet):**
- Gmail integration (Phase 2)
- Competitive intelligence (Phase 2)
- Team collaboration features (Phase 3)
- Public roadmap publishing (Phase 3)
- Mobile app (Phase 4+)

### Success Criteria for Phase 1

**Technical:**
- AI extracts 80%+ of feature requests correctly
- Dashboard loads in <1 second
- Zero critical bugs in production

**User:**
- 5 Hiver teammates complete onboarding
- Users log in 3+ times per week
- Team finds value: "This saves me time"

**Business:**
- Validate concept with real usage
- Prove AI works at acceptable accuracy
- Build foundation for external launch
