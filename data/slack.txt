His goal is to ensure that the HubSpot ticket owner and ticket status automatically reflect in Hiver (as the Hiver assignee and status). Currently, this is not possible because: The out-of-the-box HubSpot integration only surfaces Contact/Deal info, not Ticket details. Permalinks do not map to Conversation IDs (CIDs) or Ticket IDs, which prevents him from linking HubSpot tickets to the right Hiver conversations.

37	Feature request from a company which is `Existing customer` *Customer name* - AWRE Sports *Feature category* - Others *Feature description* Description: Currently, Hiver’s auto-responder feature only applies at the mailbox level, meaning replies are triggered for all incoming emails to the shared mailbox. There is no option for setting up a vacation/out-of-office responder specific to an individual user. Customer Request: A customer has requested the ability to set up an automatic vacation responder that is triggered only when emails are assigned to them in Hiver. This would allow users to notify external senders of their absence without impacting the entire shared mailbox. Current Workaround: Users can set up a Gmail vacation responder, but this only applies to emails sent directly to their personal Gmail address, not emails received via the shared mailbox. Another workaround is to create a Hiver automation rule that replies automatically when an email is assigned to a specific user. However, this is a manual setup and not as straightforward as a dedicated vacation responder feature. *Channel* - *Associated MRR* - 204 *Urgency of ask* - Nice to have *Requested by* - <mailto:daniel.s@hiverhq.com|daniel.s@hiverhq.com> *Product* - Gmail
38	Feature request from a company which is `Existing customer` *Customer name* - *Feature category* - Others *Feature description* Description: Currently, Hiver’s SLA policy starts the timer immediately when an email arrives in the mailbox. This approach negatively impacts agent analytics for agents whose shifts begin after an email is received, as SLAs may appear breached even before the agent logs in. Problems / Pain Points: SLA Policy Triggering: SLA timers start upon email arrival rather than when an agent begins their shift, leading to inaccurate SLA metrics for agents like Louie who start later in the day. Inaccurate Analytics: Agents working varying shifts have skewed SLA and performance analytics, which impacts reporting and team performance evaluation. *Channel* - *Associated MRR* - 1144 *Urgency of ask* - Nice to have *Requested by* - <mailto:daniel.s@hiverhq.com|daniel.s@hiverhq.com> *Product* - Gmail

Use Case / Problem Statement: Customers want to trigger external events, such as GA4 events, whenever a visitor sends a message via live chat. Teams need to programmatically access live chat conversations, visitor details, and associated metadata to integrate with CRM, analytics, or marketing platforms. Without live chat endpoints, users are unable to automate workflows or track leads in real-time via their analytics systems. *Channel* - *Associated MRR* - 280 *Urgency of ask* - Nice to have *Requested by* - <mailto:daniel.s@hiverhq.com|daniel.s@hiverhq.com> *Product* - Gmail

79	Feature request from a company which is `Existing customer` *Customer name* - StartEngine *Feature category* - Integrations &amp; Open API *Feature description* Description: Currently, when a Jira task is created through the Hiver-Jira integration, Jira lists the reporter as the user who originally set up the integration, rather than the team member who actually created the task in Hiver. Use Case / Problem: Teams using the integration want Jira tasks to accurately reflect the actual creator of the task for better accountability, tracking, and workflow management. Having the reporter automatically set to the correct team member would eliminate the need for manual annotations in the task description. *Channel* - *Associated MRR* - 413 *Urgency of ask* - Nice to have *Requested by* - <mailto:daniel.s@hiverhq.com|daniel.s@hiverhq.com> *Product* - Gmail
80	Feature request from a company which is `Associated with a deal` *Customer name* - Truth Taxes *Feature category* - Others *Feature description* Summary: Currently, Hiver’s Zapier integration only allows Hiver to act as a trigger. Events in third-party apps like SuiteDash (e.g., new invoices, updated customer information) cannot trigger actions or updates in Hiver. A two-way integration would allow Hiver to not only trigger Zaps but also receive updates from SuiteDash and potentially other CRM tools. Use Case / Business Need: Our team uses SuiteDash to manage client data, invoices, and projects. At the moment, any changes made in SuiteDash do not reflect automatically in Hiver customer info. This creates manual overhead, duplicate work, and increases the risk of errors. *Channel* - Inbound *Associated MRR* - 0 *Urgency of ask* - Nice to have *Requested by* - <mailto:daniel.s@hiverhq.com|daniel.s@hiverhq.com> *Product* - Gmail

92	Feature request from a company which is `Existing customer` *Customer name* - krusebuilders *Feature category* - Others *Feature description* Customers would like the ability to build custom views that pull emails from multiple shared mailboxes into a single view. Currently, Hiver only supports custom views scoped to one shared mailbox at a time. Customer Feedback (from Calais, Kruse Builders): Customers expect that since Hiver is built for shared inbox collaboration, filters and views should work across all shared mailboxes. Limitation feels like a design flaw, as it prevents teams from organizing and monitoring conversations across mailboxes in one unified place. *Channel* - *Associated MRR* - 72 *Urgency of ask* - Nice to have *Requested by* - <mailto:daniel.s@hiverhq.com|daniel.s@hiverhq.com> *Product* - Gmail
